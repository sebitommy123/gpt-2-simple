[audience cheering, applauding]
[shouts] D.C., whatâ€™s going on? Oh my God. [chuckles excitedly] Thank you. Thank you. Sit down, sit down, get comfortable, my God. Thank you so much. Oh!
[audience cheering, applauding]
[Matt sighs gently]
Thank you. Thank you so much, man. Washington, D.C. Weâ€™re doing Netflix, baby. Weâ€™re doinâ€™ it. Weâ€™re doinâ€™ it. Oh! This is so cool, man. I wishâ€¦ [mouth clicks] I wish my grandpa could see this. He, umâ€¦ Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I always wanted to bring him here to visit. You know, he knew how much I loved D.C., and heâ€¦ heâ€¦ he loved Maryland. It was like his favorite state, whichâ€¦
[audience cheering]
Well, whâ€¦ Well, which, you know, isâ€¦ is a valid response unless youâ€™ve been to Baltimore, because it tooâ€¦ [breathes sharply] [sneeringly] What the fuck is going on in Baltimore, dude? [inhales] Marâ€¦ Bro, Maryland as a state cannot pick a tone, dawg. Just pick oneâ€¦ Itâ€™s so beautiful and so ratchet for no reason.
[audience laughing]
Can yâ€™all just pick a tone, man? All of Maryland. Yâ€™all drive to the beach with your top down and then go to Baltimore and lock all your doors. You know, no middle ground ever, man. Iâ€™ve only been to Baltimore one time. I ate lunch there, and the hostess, who seats you at the restaurant, had a black eye.
[audience laughing]
A full blackâ€¦ It wasnâ€™t like, â€œWhat happened?â€ Iâ€¦ It was pretty obvious what happened. We couldnâ€™t get over the fact, â€œThis is the face of the company?â€ Like, â€œThis isâ€¦ This is who you have greeting people?â€ And my boy, who I was with was like, â€œYeah, I feel bad for her. I feel like they should, you know, put her in the kitchen or somethingâ€¦ where nobody has to see her face, you know.â€
And I was like, â€œYeah, but I feel like if she could cook, she wouldnâ€™t have that black eye.â€ Soâ€¦ [laughing]
[audience laughing]
Testing the water, seeing if yâ€™all are gonna be fun or not. Just wanted to see.
[whistling]
Just wanted to see. [chuckles, inhales] I figure if we start with domestic violence, the rest of the show should beâ€¦ should be pretty smooth sailing after that. [sighs gently] Yeah, of course, I felt bad for her, man. She shouldâ€™ve had her protection crystals, you know what I mean?
[laughing, squealing]
Fellas, we gotta put our foot down, man. This crystal shit is getting out of control. Ladies, put the fuckinâ€™ pebbles down, okay? We are sick and tired of walking into your bedroom looking like we gotta beat you in a game of mancala before we can sleep with you. What the fuck is all this gravel doing inside, Thanos?
I swear, the biggest issue with crystal girls is the fact itâ€™s their entire personality, and they wonâ€™t shut up about it. I mean, you even, God forbid, bring it up mid-conversation.
[mimicking woman] Aw! This is my favorite one. This is, umâ€¦ This is a piece of green Peruvian jade, and it provides me with, like, strength andâ€¦ andâ€¦ and protection andâ€¦ andâ€¦ andâ€¦ and no, it doesnâ€™t.
[audience laughing]
No, itâ€™s not, okay. Thatâ€™s a broken shard of a Heineken bottle that youâ€¦ [laughs] â€¦that you bought from a white dude with dreadlocks, who also runs a throat goat yoga class. Okay? Say what it really is, some bullshit. The only thing itâ€™s protecting is me from dating another girl whoâ€™s pussy tastes like kombucha. Okay?
[audience laughing hysterically]
No more hippie shit. Shower. Maybe get back to using real deodorant? No more of this organic deodorant shit that lasts shorter than fuckinâ€™ fruit-stripe gum. Okay? No more. Yâ€™all remember that garbage?
[audience] Yeah!
It would last two chews. Thatâ€™s yâ€™all walking around, two smacks, stinkinâ€™ all over again, dude.
Iâ€™m so sick of it, man. [inhales] This hippie shit is gonna be the death of me, I swear. If I hear one more person blame how their life is going on Mercury,
[huffing sharply]
I will kill you myself. Do you understand? You leave that goddamn planet alone. Iâ€™m so tired of you ladies blaming your poor decision-making skills on planets that donâ€™t even know you.
[audience laughing]
Get this through your head. Astrology is not this magical life guideline thatâ€¦ that predetermines your future in the stars. No, none of that. Your future is dependent by your thoughts, opinions, and actions. You are in complete control of how your future turns out. Itâ€™s not up here. Itâ€™s in here the whole time. Itâ€™s up to you.
[applauding]
It has nothing to do with the stars, man. Just because Jupiter has a ring, and you donâ€™t, doesnâ€™t meanâ€¦
[audience laughing hysterically]
â€¦thatâ€™s who youâ€™re supposed to look up to for all this magical advice, man. And stop trying to explain it so confidently, you look stupid every time. Itâ€™s soâ€¦ The girl of your dreams will look you straight in the eyes and say some dumb shit, like, â€œWould you even know how the universe works?â€
[inhales] No, but tell me, Professor.
â€œThereâ€™s a planet called Mercury. When it slows its rotation around the sun, it causes retrograde 98 million miles away and thatâ€™s why my life is just in absolute shambles.â€ [mimics whimpering] â€œLike itâ€™s literally not even up to me.â€ â€œLike, itâ€™s in the stars andâ€¦ [hoarsely] â€¦like, weâ€™re literally all stardust. You know what I mean?â€
Yeah, youâ€™re gonna die alone.
[audience laughing]
â€˜Cause you canâ€™t take responsibility for your own actions. Your life isnâ€™t in shambles because of a planet in the sky. Itâ€™s because you canâ€™t live without a vape in your mouth. And you only fuck guys who need to borrow your car. Okay?
[cheering, applauding]
Yeah.
[audience whooing]
Thatâ€™s why your life is in shambles. Youâ€™re worried about Mercury while he crashing your Saturn. How stupid do you feel?
[cheering, applauding]
Wrong planet, bitch. Guess again.
[hoarsely] Yeah, itâ€™s gonna kill me, man.
I feel itâ€™s a younger generational thing too, right? The crystals and astrology and all that. Which makes sense. I fuckinâ€™ hate young people, dude. I really do. Ah!
[whooing, cheering]
Anybodyâ€¦ anybody my age or younger, you donâ€™t have anything to offer me, man. I justâ€¦ Iâ€¦ Youâ€™re so rude! Young people are so disrespectful even when theyâ€™re not trying to be.
Like, five months ago, I got a tattoo of John Lennon on the back of my arm, and itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s pretty fuckinâ€™ obviously John Lennon. Like, itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s a good tattoo. As soon as I post it on Instagram, everybody was, â€œHeâ€™s a Harry Potter fan?â€ I was like, fuck these kids, dude. That is so disrespectful to one of the greatest musicians of all time. Like, John Lennon got fuckinâ€™ Avada Kedavra on his back, and thatâ€™s why heâ€™s not here. No. Same glasses, but heâ€™s the boy who didnâ€™t live.
I know, and if that made you sad, youâ€™re my audience. Good. I like you a lot. Good.
[applauding]
It also breaks my heart. Thatâ€™s good. [inhales sharply]
God, I hate young people. And thereâ€™s no middle ground. I hate young people, and Iâ€¦ [hoarsely] â€¦I fuckinâ€™ love old people.
[audience cheering, whooing, applauding]
Oh my God. It isâ€¦ it is really an unhealthy obsession. It is. Oh, bro, I would fuck a grandma in a heartbeat. I really would do it. Iâ€™d do it.
[woman yells]
You can.
[laughing]
I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve done research. You can fuck as many as you want, and thereâ€™s no law against it. As many as you want. As many as you want. You just gotta be gentle about it. You canâ€™tâ€¦ You canâ€™t choke â€™em. You gotta, like, kink their oxygen. Know what I mean? [laughing]
[laughing, applauding]
Aah, not today. not today. Youâ€™re all right. Youâ€™re fine. Walker it off.
Fuck being somebodyâ€™s first. But somebodyâ€™s last? Thatâ€™s a flex. Oh, my goodness. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s where I thrive, baby. Iâ€™m out here cleaninâ€™ it up. They call me the Trim Reaper, dawg. Iâ€™m just out here snatchinâ€™ souls, you know what I mean?
Oh, dude, I doâ€¦ I love old people so much. Like, the more an old person is shaped like a candy cane.
[laughing hysterically]
[hoarsely] Dude. I love a motherfucker who justâ€¦ Argh! He just canâ€™t even look up. Even he doesnâ€™t know how much life is ahead of him. You know what I mean? Justâ€¦ Thatâ€™s the weight of a good life lived, fuckinâ€™ up his back, man. Ughâ€¦
You old persons gotta have bad posture, man. That tells you lived your life to the fullest. If you meet one with good posture, they dodged the draft 100%. You donâ€™t have my respect. Sorry.
Oh, man. They gotta have bad pos. The worst an old personâ€™s posture, the better the stories.
â€œHowâ€™d you get like that?â€
Used to be my favorite part about visiting my great-grandmother at the hospice center she was at for her remaining years when I was a teenager. Sheâ€™s where they take care of you for your remaining time, and my mom would drop us off for like three or four hours, which is great. I wanna spend time with my grandma, but my grandma also had dementia, so, 25 minutes in, I could be like, â€œIâ€™m gonna get some more water,â€ and sheâ€™d be, â€œThereâ€™s a lot of Blacks now.â€ Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Theâ€¦ Thereâ€™s more for sure, umâ€¦ I could excuse myself and go do my own thing. Itâ€™s not that I didnâ€™t love her or didnâ€™t wanna hang out. People with dementia canâ€™t remember, so thereâ€™s not a lot to talk about. And it just so happened the guy, Lenny, in the room right next to her remembered everything. This guy was the coolest person I had ever met. He was 97 and had the coolest life I ever heard of. Heâ€™d tell me story after story after story for hours and hours on end, and they were captivating stories. He lived a very full life. He fought in three wars in his lifetime. He climbed five mountains.
[cheering]
He, umâ€¦ Yeah, heâ€¦ he told me he fucked Rosa Parks.
[audience laughing]
I know, in the front of the bus. and I was likeâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I think you have dementia. I donâ€™t thinkâ€¦ that happened the way you remembered it. Wouldnâ€™t the back of the bus be more private? I feel like you could put in some work back there, but well, thatâ€™s the cons of being young, I guess.
You canâ€™t fact-check an old personâ€™s story. I wasnâ€™t there.
I hate being young. I donâ€™t know nothinâ€™. Iâ€™m 28. I donâ€™t know for sure that Michael Jackson was Black.
[audience laughing]
Yâ€™all keep saying it. I didnâ€™t see it. And every photo Iâ€™ve seen, he was an Asian woman, so Iâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™ll never know.
It frustrates me to no end, man. I love old people, dude. I wish my entire audience was like 65 and up. Oh my God. Yeah. Itâ€™d be a much shorter career, butâ€¦
[audience laughing]
They take into consideration who theyâ€™ve seen in their lifetime. Iâ€™m kinda flattered, you know. What I love about old stories, like hearing Lennyâ€™s stories for hours on end is it inspires me to think about the stories Iâ€™m gonna have to tell when I get to that age. I hope I live a full life and have fun stories to pass down. I liked hearing about his war stories, his adventures, his family stories. That excited me the most, to have a family someday. Iâ€™m excited to have kids, but not now. No, not now. Things are going very well, umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m also terrified to have kids, man, â€™cause Iâ€™ve made fun of a lot of people.
[audience laughing]
And if you believe in karmaâ€¦
[hisses, grunts heavily]
My kid is about to be fucked up, dude. My kid is about to have five legs and a shark fin on his back. He is about to be a monstrosity. [inhales] And I know Iâ€™m not mature enough to have that conversation when heâ€™s finally, like, â€œWhy am I like this?â€
[whines gruntingly] Fuck!
Iâ€™m just there, likeâ€¦
[hisses] Ugh! â€˜Cause Daddyâ€™s funny. You know. [chuckles] Iâ€™ve made a lot of people laugh. So will you.
[audience laughing]
[mumbling]
For different reasons, but you know. If they pay the admission.
[woman laughing hysterically]
I think itâ€™s mainly about timing for me. I wanna pick the right time to have kids â€™cause Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m 28, so realistically, I have all the time in the world, butâ€¦ The benefits of being a guy, we donâ€™t have to rush into starting a family. We can have kids whenever we want, which I donâ€™t think is fair to women, considering women are the ones who literally have to have the baby. Doesnâ€™t make sense youâ€™d have to compete against this biological clock. It seems messed up. â€˜Cause forâ€¦ for women, you can wait till youâ€™re older, but the older you get, donâ€™t the odds start to go up of your kid beingâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€œâ€¦first to lunch,â€ weâ€™ll call it.
[audience laughing]
Is there a nicer way to say it? You can groan all you want, but donâ€™t act like 25 minutes before you were allowed to go, you didnâ€™t have to watch them hauling ass down the hallway.
[laughing]
You were just likeâ€¦ Argh! Goddammit. Naruto is gonna drink up all the spaghetti. Great.
[cheering, laughing]
[audience laughing hysterically]
Not to say itâ€™s a bad thing. Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ In fact, I actually think itâ€™s kinda cool to see the way God works. If you pay attention, God always finds a way of evening things out. God always replaces a negative with a positive. Anytime you see somebody who is bornâ€¦ less fortunate in a certain aspect, you donâ€™t gotta worry â€™cause Godâ€™s gonna bless them withâ€¦ with an attribute, aâ€¦ a quality about themselves, sometimes even a skill set. Kinda evens that playinâ€™ field a little.
I noticed it first in my nephew, Chase. Heâ€™s a teenager now, but heâ€™s autistic as fuck, whâ€¦ which is probably not the medical term, but he, umâ€¦ heâ€¦ he got it, for sure. Umâ€¦ Heâ€™s, uhâ€¦ heâ€™sâ€¦ heâ€™s nonverbal. Thatâ€™s his thing. Unless youâ€™re his mom, he wonâ€™t speak to you, no eye contact, wonâ€™t acknowledge youâ€™re in the room. Itâ€™s pretty rude, but thatâ€™sâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€¦thatâ€™s his symptom, you know.
But get this. His blessingâ€¦ His blessing is that he can paint. As a teenager, he paints better than any art teacher Iâ€™ve ever had. I just think itâ€™s cool to see the way God always finds a way of eveninâ€™ things out. Itâ€™s really impressive to me, andâ€¦
[cheering, applauding]
I wish I wouldâ€™ve known to look for that sooner. It mightâ€™ve changed my perspective on things growing up. There was a kid, Alex, in our high school. Alex was the same age as me. We entered high school together. Had gym class together. Heâ€¦ he was special needs, and heâ€¦ he had aâ€¦
[sighs heavily]
heâ€¦ he had aâ€¦ [hoarsely] â€¦dick on him, man. I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ [tuts] I donâ€™t know how else to tell yâ€™all that. That boy wasâ€¦ [hoarsely] â€¦blessed, man. People felt sorry for him. â€œFuck that, dude. Heâ€™s been terrorizing us in the locker room the whole semester.â€
[audience laughing]
Got us all backed up against the lockers. Itâ€™s like, â€œGoddamn, Alex! Thatâ€™s where the extra chromosome goes?â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
â€œGood for you, man!â€ [inhales]
Until this day, heâ€™s the nicest person Iâ€™ve met. I hope heâ€™s out there hurting somebody now. Really. She needs the helmet. You know, they donâ€™t alwaysâ€¦ They donâ€™t always know their own strength. But heâ€™s a good dude. He deserves every inch of it andâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Yeah, we used to say he had dick-you-down syndrome. Yeah.
[audience laughing]
Big shout-out to Alex, man. Big shout-out to Alex.
[woman] Whoo!
Yeah. Short bus, but a long dick, man. And thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s balance. Itâ€™s what lifeâ€™s all about at the end of the day. Balance. You canâ€™t have everything.
Sometimes, you just funny.
[audience laughing]
[woman] Whoo!
[women squealing hysterically]
[cheering, applauding]
Itâ€™s fine.
I still fucked him up in dodgeball.
[audience laughing]
Out of pure jealousy. I was like, â€œYouâ€™re not even using it.â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
[exhales sharply] Yeah, butâ€¦ [sighs] God works in mysterious ways, huh?
You know whatâ€™s funny? Iâ€™ve mentioned God eight times the past two minutes. Iâ€™m really not the most religious person. Iâ€™m really not. I hope thereâ€™s a god. I pray every day that thereâ€™s a god. Itâ€™d make a lot of sense, answer a lot of questions.
Itâ€™s tricky sometimes. Certain thingsâ€™ll happen, make you question faith a little bit.
Itâ€™s hard to pick a religion, man. Itâ€™sâ€¦ I say itâ€™s hard to pick a religion, but Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I do still wear a cross chain.
[woman] Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
[audience cheering]
But for the same reason you bring a condom on the first date. You know.
[chuckles] I hope I donâ€™t gotta use it, but you know. [hoarsely] Just in case.
[audience laughing]
In case I die, and Jesus is like, â€œYou ainâ€™t gettinâ€™ in here.â€
â€œNah, son, I bought the wristband.â€
[cheering, applauding]
Let me in. I paid for this meet-and-greet. Where your dad at?
[audience laughing hysterically]
Yeah, religion isâ€¦ is just tricky, man. But Iâ€™ve always respected it. Always respected religion. Everybodyâ€™s religionâ€™s good. I have the utmost respect for. Itâ€™s important for people to have something to believe in. My ex tried to drive it home pretty heavy. She was super religious. My ex is one of the most religious people Iâ€™ve met, which is hilarious â€™cause she is not getting into heaven, bro. Notâ€¦ not a fuckinâ€™ chance, man. Not even as my plus-one. Sheâ€™s gonna have to chill for a couple centuries outside these gates, man.
She was so religious, but justâ€¦ [grinding teeth] â€¦not a good person. Like, do you know people like that?
[woman] Whoo!
Theyâ€™re so religious that youâ€™re like, â€œYouâ€™re compensating a little bit.â€
What kind of Christian wakes up to read the Bible every morning when last night, all you wanted me to do was lick your butt. Like, whaâ€¦
[audience laughing]
What psalm is that, Jezebel?
[audience laughing]
And howâ€™d you get me to do it? Thatâ€™s the bigger question. Dude, thatâ€™s fuckinâ€™ disgusting, man. You donâ€™t understand. I donâ€™t even eat onions. I never thought Iâ€™d do nothing like that. I donâ€™t know what came over me. I donâ€™t know if it was the butt Holy Spirit or what, but that shit just had your boy speaking in tongues. You know what I mean? Justâ€¦ [rattling tongue]
[audience laughing]
Still broke up. Did you ever eat someoneâ€™s ass, then break up. Itâ€™s the worst Last Supper ever, dude. Itâ€™s justâ€¦
[audience laughing, applauding]
Itâ€™s disgusting. Tastes like betrayal and pennies.
[laughing hysterically]
Butâ€¦ [sighs deeply] â€¦itâ€™s her religion, you know.
I donâ€™t, you know, discredit anybodyâ€™s beliefs. I believe in things. I do have beliefs. They might not be as deep-rooted as religion, but I do believe in things that affect my life to a severe degree. Um, for example, Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m a terrible sleeper. Iâ€¦ I have terrible, terrible sleep problems, and part of that is to do with the fact that one of my biggest beliefs is in ghosts and monsters.
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m a 28-year-old grown man, and my biggest fear is the dark. You donâ€™t know whatâ€™s in there. Iâ€™ll tell you, ghosts and monsters, and yâ€™all look ridiculous for not being more concerned about it on a day-to-day basis, dude. Theyâ€™re so real. Iâ€™m such a bitch, man. I really am. Iâ€¦ I literally have to sleep with my TV on every single night â€™cause Iâ€™ve really convinced myself that if the TVâ€™s on, the ghosts are gonna think I have people over, soâ€¦ Iâ€™ll just be like chiming in to shit that Iâ€™m watchinâ€™, just doinâ€™ too much. Justâ€¦ Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh. [shouts] Thatâ€™s crazy how much fun weâ€™re all having in here. Just me and 12 of the biggest Black dudes youâ€™ve ever seen.
[audience laughing]
Hanging out watching Mean Girls.
You know, you gottaâ€¦ [inhales sharply] â€¦lay down some ground rules. Gotta let these ghosts know theyâ€™re not safe in your house. You squatted up in there. They donâ€™t know. Twelve Black dudes ainâ€™t afraid of nothinâ€™. Except for people dressed like ghosts.
[audience laughing]
Yeah. I told you all monsters are real. I justâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I do not mess with ghosts, man. You canâ€™t even confront â€™em â€™cause the ironic thing about ghosts is the more innocent and approachable a ghost should be, the scarier it is.
The ghost of a child. Get the fuck away from me. [inhales] I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re a demon or an Amber Alert, but I want you outta my house right now. Those are always the scariest ones, just showinâ€™ up in your hallways.
[mimicking child] Come play with us.
[laughing]
Theyâ€™re always British for some reason. All dead kids are British when theyâ€™re a ghost for no reason. Little dead British kids always wanna play.
I donâ€™t even know what an American kid ghost would say, but thatâ€™d be terrifying to hear. Can you imagine crawling into bed at 3:00 a.m. and hear, â€œI hate this school.â€
[audience laughing]
[mimics gun cocking]
[audience laughing hysterically]
Just seeing if yâ€™all are still fun. Just wanted to see. Just wanted to see. Just checkinâ€™ in.
[sighs] Ah, dude. Ghosts are terrifying, man. The only thing that scares me more than ghosts is monsters, and Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m pretty sick of yâ€™all not taking â€™em seriously. â€˜Cause theyâ€™re all over the place, man. Thatâ€™s the thing about monsters. Nobody knows where theyâ€™re at. Everybody has theories as to where they think they hide. Iâ€™veâ€¦ Iâ€™ve heard weird places. Iâ€™ve heard, like, closed shower curtain. I know people who wonâ€™t use a restroom unless they open the shower curtain first to make sure this motherfucker isnâ€™t in there lathering up with the 3-in-1. It turns out heâ€™s the one takinâ€™ fistfuls of hair against the shower walls for all those years.
[audience laughing]
Mmm. A little skeptical about that one.
Some places make more sense than others. The closet is a big one. Itâ€™s pretty standard. Plenty of people are afraid of a monster cominâ€™ out in the middle of the night just eatinâ€™ you up. That checks out. Thatâ€™s fuckinâ€™ terrifyinâ€™. You canâ€™t have a monster cominâ€™ outta the closet. Thatâ€™s scary twice.
[exhales]
[audience laughing]
Youâ€™re tellinâ€™ me not only is there a monster in my room but maybe heâ€™s gay?
[screams loudly]
You said he was gonna eat me up. You didnâ€™t say dick first. You left out so many details.
[audience laughing hysterically]
Now, Iâ€™ve just got this gay darkness roaming around my bedroom? Iâ€™m being haunted by Lil Nas X? You let me know. You let me know.
[audience laughing hysterically]
I wanna know if the next songâ€™s about me. Mm-hmm, yeah. Like, whyâ€™d he choose my closet, ya know? Like, itâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s less scary more flattering. I can get on board with that. The closet makes sense.
I will say probably the number one spot thatâ€™s most common that I was never really afraid of a monster hiding there was under the bed. Itâ€™s one of the more common places, especially when youâ€™re a kid. Youâ€™d be afraid of a monsterâ€™s hand cominâ€™ up and grabbinâ€™ your leg. Never scared me. I think because I started masturbating pretty early.
[audience laughing]
So by 11 or 12, I was like, â€œHey, huh, if a hand reach up here.â€
[Matt chuckling]
Heâ€™s just helpinâ€™. You know what I mean? Iâ€™m the monster now. You know, bro. He ainâ€™t even built for that, bro. I would dick my bed demon down, dude. Heâ€™s not built for those rounds. Heâ€™d be catchinâ€™ feelinâ€™s, getting possessive and shit. Heâ€™s knockinâ€™ on my headboard at 3:00 a.m. Heâ€™s like, â€œYou up?â€ What? I got school in the morning, dawg. Chill out. Chill. Goddamn.
[sighs] Youâ€™re not full? Huh?
[audience laughing]
I didnâ€™t think he could fit under there, man. Thereâ€™s no way thereâ€™s room for a monster and all those towels under my bed. You know what I mean? And if there is one, he is crunchy. He ainâ€™tâ€¦ He ainâ€™t sneakinâ€™ up on nobody. Itâ€™s way too loud.
[mimicking crunching]
You can hear a semen demon coming from a mile away. You really can, right? They ainâ€™t got no stealth at all. Itâ€™s a damn shame.
[sighs, lips click]
However, piggybacking off of semen demonsâ€¦ Theâ€¦
[audience laughing]
There is another monster people are pretty afraid of we should talk about. Clowns.
[whooing]
A lot of people donâ€™t fuck with clowns. Even though youâ€™ve dated a few. Thatâ€™s on you. Stillâ€¦ Still a respectable fear, I get it. Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m not personally afraid of clowns, but I get it. Iâ€™veâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got four sisters, and theyâ€™re terrified of clowns. â€˜Cause when I was about 13 years old, we all watched the, uh, the original It movies.
For anybody who has no idea, thereâ€™s a movie called It. Itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s based on a Stephen King book. Itâ€™s about this killer-demon-monster clown, who lives in the sewer system, and he comes up through the drains to, like, eat children. Thatâ€™s the whole movie, him as a monster.
We watched this movie at my grandpaâ€™s house, and it scared my sisters so bad, they didnâ€™t shower for three weeks. Thatâ€¦ thatâ€™s how terrified they were, that he was gonna come up through the drains and eat them when they were kids. But they didnâ€™t know that by that timeâ€¦ I had been jerking off in the shower. So like, he been eating my children. I figuredâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I figure we built a good rapport and understanding, you know? Youâ€™re not gonna kill the cow when you get the milk for free. Thatâ€™s justâ€¦ Thatâ€™s bad Business 101. You know? His name is Pennywise, but he be eating quarter-loads. Iâ€™ll tell ya that much right now. That boyâ€¦ That boy eatinâ€™ good down there, man. And they all float. Donâ€™t they? Right on top of the water. Like an oil spill.
[audience laughing]
You shouldnâ€™t be jerking off in the shower. Thatâ€™s how you get early onset Candy Cane â€™cause youâ€™re just hunched over in that hot water. Youâ€™re getting molded like a mouthpiece.
Itâ€™s also a waste of your time â€™cause if you miss the drain directly, and it gets somewhere on the tub, you gotta spend the next 12 minutes just gathering water, likeâ€¦
[audience laughing hysterically]
Itâ€™s gotta be a direct hit, or it does no damage at all. And Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m realizing right now, I need more guy fans. Thatâ€™d help a lot. If this room was 70% dudes the way it is women, this joke would have been likeâ€¦ Ahh! â€˜Cause all the dudes get it and every girl is like, â€œIs it a jellyfish?â€ Like, what? Whyâ€¦ why would it stickâ€¦ Kind of, consistency-wise, itâ€™s not far off from a jellyfish. Itâ€™s disgusting, whatever it is, man.
[snorts] Guys are so gross.
[exhales] Luckily, weâ€™re funny on accident. I think thatâ€™s what helps us get through the embarrassment of puberty â€™cause you ladies would lose your mind if you really saw how much of a shitshow it is to be a young man trying to learn how to masturbate proficiently. Ah, dude. Itâ€™s just embarrassing mistake after embarrassing mistake.
Iâ€¦ I mean, I suppose nobody understands the difficulty more than women â€™cause how yâ€™all figure out your own little fidget spinner on your ownâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™ll never understand in a million years. Yâ€™all are just thrown to the wilderness with no ownerâ€™s manual or nothing. Just forced to figure it out for yourself. And you do! All by yourself, and Iâ€™m so proud of each and every one of you. I really am.
â€˜Causeâ€¦
[girls cheering, applauding]
â€˜Cause if you didnâ€™t, we never would, literally ever. You already have to walk us through every step of the way, and even thatâ€™s exhausting in the simplest form.
Fellas. How many times have you fingered a girl for so long you wake up the next day, likeâ€¦ Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Did I go fuckinâ€™ bowling last night? Did I indoor rock climb for nine hours? Iâ€™m walking around the next day pointing at shit like Spider-Man â€™cause I canâ€™tâ€¦ I canâ€™t straighten my tendons anymore. I canâ€™t grip shit the next day. Itâ€™s like great. Yeah, you came, and I got cerebral palsy. Awesome. Yeah, that.
[hoarsely] It hurts, man. You ladies are very strong. Good job.
Women definitely have it harder. Thereâ€™s no argument there. I think men just have it more embarrassing, â€™cause we donâ€™tâ€¦ we donâ€™t take anybodyâ€™s advice. We only learn via trial and error, and you donâ€™t forget those errors. Every man in this room has been caughtâ€¦ whether you know it or not.
[audience laughing]
Youâ€™re not as sneaky as you think you are. Andâ€¦ Thatâ€™s good, you have to figure out your system. As an adult man, every guy in this room knows how to do it, where to do it, when to do it. How to adjust according to time zones and solstices. Thereâ€™s a wholeâ€¦ Thereâ€™s a whole rigmarole that goes on, but we have to figure that out the hard way.
And thank God I never got caught, like, in the act. I donâ€™t know how I wouldâ€™ve recovered, but I do remember getting caught with porn for the first time, and I was, uh, oh, boyâ€¦ [sighs deeply] Iâ€¦ I was 12 years old. Yeah. In my defense, I wasnâ€™t looking for porn when I found it. I was looking for Christmas presents in my parentsâ€™ bedroom.
It was middle of December. When I get home from school, there was always a couple-hour window before my mom would get home from work. I knew theyâ€™d been Christmas shopping, so I broke into their room. I was snoopinâ€™ around. First place I checked was under the bed. My bed monster was there.
â€œOh, you looking for another bitch?â€ I was likeâ€¦ â€œNot now, a different mission. Okay?â€ Umâ€¦
Umâ€¦ Closet. Thatâ€™s where you keep the goods, right? So I go over to the closet confidently. Wing it open. [exclaims] Nothinâ€™.
So I was about to just give up and go back to my room, and I heard a voice. I donâ€™t know if it came from in my head or under the bed, but it said, [whispering] â€œCheck the top shelf.â€
So I did.
And at first glance, it was a typical top shelf of a parentsâ€™ closet. Blankets folded up at the front, some hoodies to the side, but what caught my eye was a piece of blue cardboard sticking up from behind the blankets, so I brought the blankets down, and it revealed thisâ€¦ this gigantic Bud Light beer box. One of the huge cases, like the 64-can count of Bud Light. You have stepdads? You know what Iâ€™m talking about. Yeah, â€œThat this ainâ€™t my real familyâ€ case of beer.
But I knew, even at 12 I knew. I was like, â€œThatâ€™s not where beer goes. I betcha thereâ€™s presents in there.â€
And boy was there.
[audience laughing]
Bro, I brought this box down. It was the biggest box of porn anyone has ever seen. It was a whole box filled with, like, 40 VHS tapes that my stepdad had accumulated over his â€œcareer,â€ I guess. And Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m just siftinâ€™ through â€™em. Theyâ€™re labeled different, weird things. One of them was, like, April 2003, which was terrifying â€™cause thatâ€™s my momâ€™s name.
[audience laughing]
I was like, â€œJune, July, August better be in here somewhere.â€ Like this better beâ€¦ This better be a time stamp and not therapy forever. Umâ€¦ Couldnâ€™t risk it, chose a blank one off the top, put the box and blankets back exactly the way I found them, ran to my room with it. I had a VHS player in my room, and I watched it. A lot.
That first one was for me. Treat yourself. Yeah. But after that first time, I was really in there taking down notes. â€˜Cause not a lot of women really know how important porn is to the learning process of a young man. â€˜Cause before we see porn, we donâ€™t know anything, and we really pretend like we do, so this is a bombshell of new information to try to absorb. Itâ€™s very confusing. When youâ€™re that young and inexperienced, you have no idea that porn is not real sex. At that age, you canâ€™t even fathom that those are two different things. After I watched this one movie, I thought you could only have sex with five other people.
[audience laughing hysterically]
I thought all sex was gang bangs. I was like, â€œHuh?â€ I need more and better friends.
[audience laughing]
Not Alex.
Itâ€™s also a lot of positive information we do need â€™cause weâ€™re so stupid and so confident at that age.
You ever talked to a middle school boy? Weâ€™re all like, â€œI fucked 100 girls last recess, bro.â€
â€œYouâ€™re a virgin.â€
And then, weâ€™ll finally see porn a year later, and weâ€™re like, â€œOh shit! Pussy is so much lower than I thought it was.â€
[audience laughing]
But before we see porn, every boy thinks a pussy is right here.
[mumbling]
We think we walk dick-first into your belly button, and thatâ€™s justâ€¦ Thatâ€™s what doing sex is. You know what I mean? You hope she got an innie.
[audience laughing]
So itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s a lot of new information to try to digest, you know? Iâ€™m enjoyinâ€™ myself. Iâ€™m excited. Canâ€™t wait to go to school. Tell my friends. I know Iâ€™mma be the man. But because I was so caught up, I made the biggest rookie mistake. Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I didnâ€™t even thinkâ€¦ toâ€¦ put it back. I put the box and blankets back, but I was like, â€œHeâ€™s got plenty.â€ Thereâ€™s no way heâ€™s gonna notice one missing, right?
Wrong.
[audience laughing]
The same night, dude, around 11:00 p.m. I didnâ€™t even get this tape for 24 hours. Iâ€™m in my room, packing up for school the next day. Backpackâ€™s full, Iâ€™m crawling in bed. Iâ€™m fuckinâ€™ exhausted. From all the notes. And Iâ€™m nice and cozy under the sheets, comfy under the covers, and I hear my stepdad come home from working his late-night shift. The sounds in the house were routine every single night. I could paint the picture and see what he was doing without seeing what he was doing. All the sounds are the same every night. Youâ€™d hear him come through the garage into the kitchen, crack a beer, come through the living room into the bedroom, where you hear him turn on the shower and get outta his work clothes. Just like every night. Only this night, I hear him crack the beer, come through the living room into the bedroomâ€¦ no shower. Just like 20-25 seconds of silence. And then, I hear throughout the houseâ€¦
[shouts] â€œWhat the fuck?â€
[audience laughing, applauding]
Iâ€™m in my room, like, â€œThat could be anything.â€ I hope my momâ€™s cheating in there.
[audience laughing hysterically]
I hope he walked in on five other people in his house. Because that exclamation was followed by another two minutes of just silence. So Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m in my room, like, â€œWhat the fuck is going on?â€
Because then, I hear the footsteps again. Theyâ€™re getting closer and heavier. Iâ€™m sweating and hard, a terrifying combination at that age. It was the first time in my life I hoped mysterious footsteps was a ghostâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€¦preferably the ghost of my real dad, so this wasnâ€™t about to happen. I knew he was gonna whoop my ass. I knew I was in trouble. My bed monster was holdinâ€™ my hand. Iâ€™m like, â€œNot right now. Chill, chill. Maybe after. Weâ€™ll see how this goes.â€
Umâ€¦ The footsteps stop at my bedroom door.
[silently] Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck!â€
The door creaks open, [mimicking creaking] and my stepdad leans in, and all he says isâ€¦ [hoarsely] â€œIâ€™m missing something.â€
[audience laughing]
[applauding]
â€œI know you know what I know, and when I get home from work tomorrow, I want it back and rewound.â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
[audience cheering, applauding]
I was like, â€œTo the beginning or where you finished?â€
[mumbles]
We gotta come up with some kind of time system now. Thisâ€¦ this is our collection now, okay?
He was like, â€œYou wanna be grounded?â€
â€œGonna keep me in my room with this movie? I guess, lock me up.â€ Know what I mean? All summer, baby. Iâ€™m good.
It was a real turning point in he and Iâ€™s relationship â€™cause we hated each other, we had nothing in common, butâ€¦ but weâ€¦ we finally had a thing. You know, Iâ€¦ I finally had leverage for once. We couldnâ€™t snitch on the other person without losing everything. It was nice. You could either beat me or your dick. You ainâ€™t gonna do both, okay. Deal? Deal?
[audience laughing hysterically]
[cheering, applauding]
Thatâ€™s how we bonded. You know? It was nice.
[gently] Oh, man.
[squealing]
[Matt sniffs]
Yeah. That was a good bonding experience, man. Then, the Internet had to come and ruin everythinâ€™.
I like Internet porn, but you canâ€™t bond with your family anymore.
I hate the Internet. I really do. Social mediaâ€¦ I canâ€™t stand social media, which I know is crazy for yâ€™all to hear â€™cause itâ€™s why youâ€™re all here.
Thatâ€™s a fun fact for you to know. I hate social media. I never wanted to do it. I put it off for years. I canâ€™t stand it.
I think social media is awful, such a negative, toxic place. Itâ€™s full of horrible people saying horrible things all the time. Itâ€™s the worst place to never exist, man.
[audience cheering, whooing]
[applauding]
Itâ€™s awful what people say, theseâ€¦ theseâ€¦ these people, theseâ€¦ trolls. [inhales deeply] Itâ€™s a bunch of fuckinâ€™ losers with no friends and no life, and no profile picture.
[audience laughing]
Sit at home all day trying toâ€¦ [sneeringly] â€¦cancel people, or say mean comments â€™cause their life sucks so fuckinâ€™ bad they canâ€™t possibly imagine a life of misery by themselves. They have to try to drag other people down by leaving mean comments and saying rude stuff.
[exhales] I respond every time. Every time, dude. Iâ€¦ I canâ€™t not! I canâ€™tâ€¦ I cannot fathom a reality where people can talk to you as disrespectful as they want without facing any physical consequences. That drives me absolutely insane, man. And I knowâ€¦
[audience cheering, applauding]
Iâ€¦ I knowâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I know as aâ€¦ [sneeringly] â€œâ€¦public figure,â€ Iâ€™m supposed to be, like, the bigger person and take the high road, but fuckinâ€™ kill yourself, dude. Iâ€¦ That goes for any Internet shit talker out there, man. And I know thatâ€™s a harsh thing to say to somebody, but the way I see it, nobody whoâ€™s a good person and actually contributes anything positive to society is ever gonna go out of their way to leave a negative comment under something youâ€™ve been so brave as to create and share with the world, and we just donâ€™t need people like that around. Sorry.
[audience cheering, applauding]
Itâ€™s just insane the lengths people will go to talk shit on the Internet, man.
Earlier this year, we were flying from Los Angeles up to Vancouver, Canada for a comedy festival. I had one show, one night. It was a 36-hour trip. Real quick, in and out. Right? Head to the airport. The only thing Iâ€™ve brought with me was my backpack, which youâ€™d think would be ideal except for itâ€™s an inconvenience as soon as you get to the airport â€™cause TSA doesnâ€™t know where the fuck a backpack goes, and they change the rules every day and then treat you like youâ€™re an idiot for not knowing their made-up set of rules.
This specific occasion, I get through TSA, little to no issues. They donâ€™t have to pull the bag aside. Now, Iâ€™m heading to the gate, heading to the plane. Iâ€™m actually pretty excited about the flight â€™cause itâ€™s not that long, and I know I have a window seat, which is inarguably the best seat on the plane.
[audience cheering]
Yeah. Yeah, until the end of the flight. â€˜Cause you know how they come by to let you know theyâ€™re about to land? Fifty-five minutes before theyâ€™re about to land.
[audience laughing]
And they willâ€¦ [laughs] And they will wake you up from your window slumber just to say some stupid shit like, [sneeringly] â€œI need you to put your window shade all the way up for landing.â€ Like this motherfucker checking his blind spot in 28F.
[audience laughing]
[exhales] So, Iâ€™m at least looking forward to gettinâ€™ a little nap on the flight. So weâ€™re boarding the plane. Itâ€™s a smaller plane, one youâ€™ve all been on, where the overhead bins are so small they make you gate-check all your luggage. So I lucked out just having the backpack â€™cause even if the bag did fit in the bin, which it didnâ€™t. Too small. Everybody knows your backpack goes under the seat in front. I know that, you know that. I do it six times a week.
So Iâ€™m settlinâ€™ into the seat, putting the bag under, and I had made a small mistake. Iâ€¦ I had overpacked the bag by just a little bit. So it only fit, like, 75% under the seat in front of me. So Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ it out and Iâ€™m like, you know what? Iâ€™ll have more room and be more comfortable if I put my bag underneath my legs this way. So much more room. Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I could still mermaid a little bit. Problem solved. Now, Iâ€™m sitting back relaxing, waiting to see whoâ€™s gonna sit next to me â€™cause who sits next to you plays a huge impact on your flight experience, right?
I get fucked immediately.
Dude, right behind me in the boarding process, here comes two of the worst possible passengers to sit next to. Beside me in the middle seat, is a three-year-old boy whoâ€¦ Yeah, as soon as he sits down, is on his three-year-oldâ€¦
[whimpering]
Iâ€™m just like, man. I will cave this motherfuckerâ€™s sternum in. Okay? I bet itâ€™s still soft.
[audience laughing]
Andâ€¦ Iâ€™m pissed off. Not at the crying. Your baby crying on a plane doesnâ€™t even bother me. I know you canâ€™t control that, but what you can control is the physicality of your child. â€˜Cause for the rest of this 30-minute boarding process, this kid would not get his hand this far away from my face. Justâ€¦
[whining]
And Iâ€™m doing all the polite things to get him away. Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, butâ€¦ [roars] Okay, all right. Probablyâ€¦â€ [rattles] â€œProbably enough. Somebody can break this up?â€
Iâ€™m doing all the things to let the dad know this isnâ€™t okay, and heâ€™s not paying attention. I was this close to leaning over to the dad and being like, â€œHey! You mind getting your sexy-ass kid away from me.â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
Yeah. I know thatâ€™s gross. But what do I gotta do to get your attention to let you know this is inappropriate. Whatâ€™s going on over here?
The dad could not have been more incompetent. He was in the aisle seat watching shit on his iPad, and theâ€¦ the dad wasâ€¦ [exhales] No disrespect, just an accurate detail to the story, but the dad was no less than Iâ€™dâ€¦ Iâ€™d say 425 pounds. Like, heâ€¦ he was a big dude. If I had to piss on this flight, it was gonna be in my seat, which I fully accepted. Itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s fine.
So Iâ€™m justâ€¦ [exhales] â€¦trying to keep my composure. Weâ€™re departing from the gate, heading towards the runway, and the flight attendantâ€™s making her rounds up and down, make sure everyoneâ€™s buckled in, and she stopped at my row. She saw my bag under my legs, and she goes, â€œUh-huh.â€
â€œSir, Iâ€™m gonna need you to put your bag under the seat in front of you.â€
I said, â€œAhh. Doesnâ€™t fit, but itâ€™s okay.â€
â€œLook.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œStill got plenty of space, super comfortable.â€
â€œI wouldnâ€™t even worry about it. Thank you.â€
And she goes, â€œItâ€™s not okay. Put your bag under the seat in front of you, or I will check it where you can go get it at baggage claim.â€
I sâ€¦ I said, â€œItâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t fit, andâ€¦ weâ€™ve already departed. What do you wanna do?â€
And she said, â€œI donâ€™t know, not my bag, not my problem.â€
I said, â€œYouâ€™re not gonna speak to me like this is Spirit Airlines, okay?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œI am an American Platinum Rewards Executive Pro member. Okay? And I have enough miles for us to speak like adults and agree that we both know thatâ€™s a stupid rule. Itâ€™s not affecting anything. Look.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œLetâ€™s just drop it and move on with the flight.â€
She goes, â€œItâ€™s not a stupid rule. Itâ€™s impeding your exit.â€
I said, â€œOh. For real? Trapped. First one off is bitch.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œI promise you itâ€™s okay.â€
â€œItâ€™s not okay. If thereâ€™s an emergency, you need to be able to get off as quickly as possible.â€
I said, â€œHey, what do you thinkâ€™s impeding my exit more? My bag or fuckinâ€™ Timon and Pumbaaâ€¦ [shouts] â€¦right next to me.â€
[audience cheering, whooing]
[applauding, whistling]
â€œHuh?â€
Even the baby was likeâ€¦ â€œAhh!â€ And I was like, Youâ€™re pissing off this sexy-ass baby, man.
[audience laughing]
So nowâ€¦ [exhales sharply] believe it or not, now is when the trouble actually begins.
Iâ€™m on the plane, Iâ€™m pissed off, and Iâ€™ve got Wi-Fi.
[Matt sighs]
So, like an idiot, as soon as I get service, I get on Twitter, and I tweet about what I just went through. Basically, all I tweeted was just stating that I thought this was a ridiculous rule for her to threaten to check my bag and add this very inconvenient process to my very quick in-and-out trip when it wasnâ€™t affecting anybody or anything. Thatâ€™s all I tweeted.
And, man. I didnâ€™t know that Twitter is allâ€¦ [changing pitch] â€¦flight attendants, all of them.
[audience laughing]
Every single one of them. Everybody on Twitter knows every airplane rule, and they give the most amount of fucks about them, apparently.
Dude, hundreds, on hundreds, on hundreds of strangers start filling my timeline with the angriest tweets, furious at my stance on the situation. And the dumb general consensus they would say was shit, likeâ€¦ [sneeringly] â€œHow hard could it be to just follow the rules?â€
Hereâ€™s the thing. [sighs] I understand rules. I understand why safety precautions are set to keep everybody safe. Obviously, I get that. But also, use your fuckinâ€™ brain, right?
For example, I understand that the speed limit on most freeways, and it varies from city to city, but on average, itâ€™s about 65 miles per hour. I totally understand and respect that is the designated, suggested speed for us citizens to follow to keep traffic moving at an appropriate pace. I get that.But also, if you for real drive 65 miles per hour on the freeway, I will fuckinâ€™ kill you, do you understand?
[audience cheering, applauding]
Ha! Drive faster, pussy.
[audience laughing]
Use your instincts to go, â€œYou know what? I can open this bitch up to 80 like an adult and keep this shit moving.â€ Right? You useâ€¦ You use your instincts to navigate rules, right? Thatâ€™s how I felt about the plane situation.
I know what the bag rule is, everybody does, but itâ€™s not affecting anybody so how about we chill the fuck out about it?
[shouts] Nope. Instead, I argue with 700 strangers for eight hours, dude. Oh, and weâ€™re twerkling back and forth and back and forth. Andâ€¦ The best part about arguing with people on the Internet about something youâ€™ve personally experienced, is that they werenâ€™t there to witness any of the details of the account, right? They only know what youâ€™ve told them and what they wanna assume.
So, very quickly after you start arguing, people will just start throwing out their own wild scenarios that have nothing to do with what youâ€™re even talking about just so they seem justified.
I just didnâ€™t wanna check my bag, and people were saying things like, â€œItâ€™s not about your safety. Itâ€™s about the safety of people around you. What if thereâ€™s an emergency crash landing into a mountain, and during the evacuationâ€¦â€
â€œSay it again slower for yourself. Go ahead. You think weâ€™re gonna survive the crash?â€ Into the mountain?â€
And they have an argument for everything. â€œBut what if we do survive? And because your bag wasnâ€™t all the way under the seat, it ends up in the aisleway and someone trips over it and injures themself?â€
[chugging]
[panting heavily]
If youâ€¦ canâ€™tâ€¦ step the fuck over my ten-inch tall JanSport backpack to save your own life, natural selection, dawg.
[audience cheering hysterically]
[applauding, whooing]
You gotta fuckinâ€™ die. Okay. Youâ€™re not athletic enough to stay alive.
Dude, Iâ€¦ I could not believe the lengths people will go to to argue about shit that has nothing to do with them on the Internet. Itâ€™s impressive, man, because it snowballs very quickly. It quickly becomes this mob mentality â€™cause what happens online is once a large enough group of people start getting upset with you on the Internet, everybody wants to get their lickinâ€™, â€™cause itâ€™s full of people who have negativity towards themself that they have to project onto other people. This is their opportunity â€™cause thatâ€™s your punishment.
If you ever get in trouble on the Internet, your punishment is that people can say anything they want to you. Anything, even if itâ€™s way worse than what you said to get in trouble in the first place. Itâ€™s impressive, and ultimately, that stuff never bothers me. Like, lâ€¦ look. Youâ€™re never gonna hurt my feelings. Okay, Iâ€™ve been dead inside for so long. Like, myâ€¦ my plane crashed a long time ago, and I didnâ€™t step over the bag, emotionally speaking. Ya know what I mean, soâ€¦
You can talk your shit as much as you want. The thing you have to know about me and what Iâ€™ve learned, through therapy or whatever, is that Iâ€™mâ€¦ [exhales] â€¦Iâ€™m a very defensive person, apparently. Iâ€¦ I have a very quick trigger reaction to feel the need to defend myself if I feel like somebody is coming at me. And Iâ€¦ I go for the kill every time.
So look, you can talk your shit to me online as much as you want, say whatever mean, hurtful things you wanna say to try to hurt my feelings, but just know, [panting softly] Iâ€™m gonna fuck you up verbally, dude. [sputters] Iâ€™mâ€¦ My goal is to now make you cry. Like, Iâ€™m gonna win this battle every time. So when I hit you harder than you hit me first, donâ€™t act like youâ€™re the fuckinâ€™ victim, okay? Thatâ€™s my biggest pet peeve in the entire Internet, andâ€¦
[audience cheering]
â€¦probablyâ€¦ probably the best example of that was throughout this Twitter interaction when all this backpack shit was going on. Iâ€™m arguing with people, weâ€™re going roast for roast, just really having some fun wastinâ€™ time. I was having fun with it.
Then, there was this one woman. Took it too far. She would not shut the fuck up, dude. She, by herself, probably tweeted me like 60 to 70 times whether I responded or not, and I responded to a lot. But notâ€¦ not all of them obviously. She was one of those people, saw everybody getting their lick and she wanted to be a part of that, so she started saying meaner and meaner and meaner things expecting no consequences, and I didnâ€™t really care.
Until her last tweet. The last tweet, I just couldnâ€™t let slide. The last thing she said to me was, â€œI donâ€™t understand why you have to be such an insubordinate, crybaby, little bitch.â€
[audience oohing]
[exhales sharply]
[tongue clicks]
Should I just have blocked her? [tongue clicks] My publicist says yes.
[audience laughing]
[sighs deeply]
But I was so sick of being ganged up on 1-v-700. She was being very mean. She started it. Andâ€¦ just based off of her profile photo, she was a, umâ€¦ [tongue clicks, takes a deep breath] â€¦heavier-set woman. All I saidâ€¦ in defense of myself, was, â€œWellâ€¦ [chuckling] â€¦had you not been taking up two seatsâ€¦
[audience laughing hysterically]
â€¦there would have been room for me to safely secure my backpack in another chair.â€
Thatâ€™s all I said, whichâ€¦ statistically is not incorrect.
[audience laughing]
But as we all know, everybody wants to be a victim now, right? So how did she, the person who started it, react?
[squeals intensely] â€œHow could he say something like that? Heâ€™s body-shaming me. Cancel Matt Rife.â€
â€œBitch, you canâ€™t cancel me. Iâ€™m not your gym membership. Get the fuck off my feed then.â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
[applauding, whistling]
[cheering intensely]
I didnâ€™t start shit with you. Iâ€™m a nice person, man. I never wanna hurt anybodyâ€™s feelings, but I fuckinâ€™ will.
[audience laughing]
It had nothing to do with her, man. All I wanted to do was complain about my backpack. And now Iâ€™m this bitchâ€™s 13th reason.
[sneeringly] Okay.
[audience laughing]
No. No, fuck that. You can count reasons, but not calories. Get the fuck outta my face, dude. No. Nope. Nope. Nope. Not doing sympathy today, D.C. Not doing it. And before any of yâ€™all sit there even think about taking her side. You goâ€¦ [hoarsely] â€œOh, I donâ€™t know, Matt. Thatâ€™s awfully personal. I meanâ€¦ I mean, is it really worth you making fun of her weight in defense of yourself. What if word gets back to her youâ€™re still making fun of her weight, and it affects her so severely she does something drastic, like, like, like, likeâ€¦ like, hangs herself. How would that make you feel?â€
[smirking] Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[audience laughing]
[woman squeals]
Howâ€™d she get up there?
[audience laughing hysterically]
[cheering, applauding]
Huh? Yeah.
[woman squealing repeatedly]
Iâ€™d be fuckinâ€™ amazedâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€¦that they make tow cables that strong. I really would. I really fuckinâ€™ would, dude.
Listen. Fuck these people, man. Your social media is your art. You can create and share whatever you want to share. And if anybodyâ€¦ if anybody has a problem with that, I say post more of that shit.
[audience cheering hysterically]
Shove it down their fuckinâ€™ throat, man.
Do you have any idea how many people donâ€™t like me or my comedy? You know what? I post every fuckinâ€™ dayâ€¦
[woman] Love you!
â€¦â€™cause thatâ€™s what feels right to me.
[audience cheering]
Itâ€™sâ€¦
[audience whistling]
Itâ€™s what feels right, and Iâ€™m just doing what I think is funny, and all I can hope to come from that is that it makes other people smile, and it makes them happy. Thatâ€™s all I ever want to come from any of this. So who cares if absolutely nobody believes in you, man. Fuck these people. For 12 years, nobody believed in me, man. And if I let that affect how I respected my own thoughts and ideas, I wouldnâ€™t be doing a Netflix Special at Constitution Hall in my favorite city in the entire country, man.
[audience cheering hysterically]
[applauding]
[man cheering] Whoo, whoo, whoo!
[audience whooing]
But what do I know? I only do crowd work, right?
[audience cheering hysterically]
[upbeat electronic music playing]
Hope everybody enjoyed themselves. Old people, thank you for coming. I know you have to be up soon. Did you know who I was when youâ€¦ when you came here?
[Matt] You did?
Yeah.
They play TikTok on the Hallmark? Shut up.
[audience laughing]
[Matt] What is that?
Whatâ€™s in here? We got, uhâ€¦ Is this weed edibles? Fifty milligrams, you murderer. If you fuck around and take 50 mg on your first edible, you will change your pronouns, dude. Like, you willâ€¦
Black people, thank yâ€™all. I think itâ€™s just yâ€™all. Ah, two. I thought for sure I had a more diverse fan base. [grunts] Not as much.
[yells] Oh. Okay. All right. Letâ€™s not point â€™em out. That feels very January 6th of yâ€™all. Letâ€™s chill out. I know. Itâ€™s yâ€™allâ€™s city. I know.

Mike Birbigliaâ€˜s stand-up comedy show, The Old Man and the Pool, is a hilarious and thought-provoking exploration of middle age, mortality, and the importance of finding humor in lifeâ€™s challenges.
Birbiglia recounts his own personal experiences with aging, from his doctorâ€™s recommendation that he start doing cardio five days a week to his embarrassing encounter with an elderly man at the YMCA pool.
The show is full of Birbigliaâ€™s trademark observational humor, and he finds the funny in even the most mundane situations. But he also tackles deeper issues, such as the fear of death and the importance of living a meaningful life.
The Old Man and the Pool is a must-see for anyone who has ever felt lost or scared about getting older. Birbigliaâ€™s show is a reminder that we are not alone in our fears and anxieties, and that there is still plenty of laughter to be found in life, even as we age.
Here are some of the critical reviews of The Old Man and the Pool:
â€¢ â€œA perfectly constructed 85 minutesâ€ (Deadline) â€¢ â€œBroadwayâ€™s great comic storyteller provides a perfectly constructed 85 minutesâ€ (The New York Times) â€¢ â€œA hilarious and thought-provoking exploration of middle age,Â mortality,Â and the importance of finding humor in lifeâ€™s challengesâ€ (The Hollywood Reporter) â€¢ â€œA must-see for anyone who has ever felt lost or scared about getting olderâ€ (Variety)
The Old Man and the Pool is available to stream on Netflix.

Hey!
[crowd cheering]
How are ya? Look at us. Weâ€™re all here! Weâ€™re all here. This is so exciting. Oh my gosh.
What better place to be than the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, which is one of the Lincoln centers at Lincoln Center.
Andâ€¦ congratulations on finding the correct one.
[crowd chuckles]
Iâ€™m thrilled youâ€™re here. Iâ€™mâ€¦ My last show was called The New One, and it was down about 15 blocks that way. You saw it. You saw it.
[crowd cheers]
And this one is called The Old Man and The Pool.
[crowd chuckles]
So in 2017, I went for my annual checkup, which I always dread â€™cause I have a lot of pre-existing conditions, which I call â€œconditionsâ€ because everything is existing.
Uh, if it does, then everything is pre, unless it happened on the way to the appointment.
[crowd laughs]
So when I get that checklist, I just circle the whole thing, and then I cross out pregnant.
[crowd laughs]
Butâ€¦ I turned 44 this year. Iâ€™ve found as Iâ€™ve gotten older, the items in my doctorâ€™s office that I thought were decorativeâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦are quite functional. So, Iâ€™ll give you an example.
My physician, this guy Dr. Walsh, asked me to blow into a tube. Itâ€™s a pulmonary test, and thereâ€™s a ball in the tube, and it simulates blowing out a candle, which is why I call it the Birthday Cake Test. It sorta tells you how many birthday cakes you have left. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
More or less, you know. And so I did it. I wentâ€¦ [blows] â€¦and heâ€™s looking at the screen and goes, â€œGo ahead and do it.â€
[crowd laughs]
Andâ€¦ Right, Iâ€™ve done it. And so Iâ€¦ I had to tell him. I was like, â€œI did it,â€ and then he goes, â€œDo it again.â€ And so I gave it some more. I wentâ€¦ [blows] Dr. Walsh taps the screen like itâ€™s a broken â€™80s television, and then he does sort of like an act out. He goes, â€œMaybe go more like this.â€ And I thought, â€œI donâ€™t know a lot about breathing, but Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s not in the shoulders.â€ Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦and then he pulls up a chair and goes, â€œI donâ€™t know what to tell you, Mike. If I was just going by that machine right there, I would say youâ€™re having a heart attackâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦right now.â€
When he said that, I got so worried â€™cause I thought, â€œIf I thought I were having a heart attack, I would either go to the emergency room, or I would call him.â€
[crowd laughs]
So I said, â€œAm I having a heart attack?â€
He said, â€œI donâ€™t think so.â€
And I said, â€œI need a more concrete answer than that.â€
[crowd chuckles]
And then he said, â€œIâ€™m gonna send you across town to see a cardiologist for a second opinion.â€
I get worried when I hear the phrase â€œsecond opinion.â€ I was under the impression the first analysis was fact-based.
[crowd laughs]
I didnâ€™t know we were just taking swings in the dark. If I knew it were opinion time, Iâ€™d point out that I donâ€™t enjoy sitting on paper. Umâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦that always makes me feel like a chicken. And I feel like you could digitize some of the forms in the waiting room. I feel like I filled a few of those out before.
[crowd laughs]
Those are opinions.
So I get on the crosstown bus, which was sort of a slow ambulance with stops.
[crowd laughs]
Thatâ€™s another opinion. And then Iâ€¦ I meet my new cardiologist. And guess what she asked me to do? Does anyone wanna guess?
[crowd] To blow.
[Mike] Blow into the tube. And I go, â€œI took that one. I got heart attack.â€ Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
She said, â€œOh wow. Thatâ€™s a low score.â€
[crowd laughs]
She said, â€œDo you have a history of heart disease in your family?â€
I go, â€œWell, my dad had a heart attack when he was 56, and actually, his dad had a heart attack when he was 56.â€ So Iâ€™ve always thought I should set aside that whole yearâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦get an Airbnb by the hospital and keep a flexible schedule. I think that might be a big year for me. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦she said, â€œWell, based on your family history, I would recommend you do cardio five days a week.â€
And I said, â€œI donâ€™t think anybody does cardio five days a week.â€
[crowd laughs]
She said, â€œA lot of people do cardio five days a week.â€
I said, â€œI donâ€™t even think professional athletes do cardio five days a week.
She said, â€œProfessional athletes definitely do cardio five days a week.â€
We talked about this for about 45 minutes.
[crowd laughs]
We agree to disagree at this point. Iâ€™m sweaty and out of breath. A little hungry. Iâ€™m always a little hungry. And, umâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦she said, uh, â€œDidnâ€™t you play sports growing up?â€
I go, â€œYeah, I played soccer, but I could blend in in practice.â€
You know what I mean? Peopleâ€™d be like, â€œThereâ€™s Mike!â€ Like, â€œNo, Mike is in the woods.â€ You know what I mean? And thenâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦and then, in ninth grade, I joined the wrestling team, which was a huge mistake, my teammates explained to me. Because you cannot blend in in wrestling practice. You have to actually wrestle or, in my case, be wrestled upon by these young muscly gentlemen whose crotches would inevitably be pressed up against my face as though they were doing a victory dance, all the while Iâ€™m wearing a womenâ€™s bathing suit that they call a singlet. But I was building character.
[crowd laughs]
And that character was a lifeguard from the 1920s.
[crowd laughs]
I hated wrestling practice more than anything in my life â€™cause we had to do so many push-ups, and at a very early age, I lost the willâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦to push up.
You know, like, Iâ€¦ I get in that first position, and I think, â€œThis is nice. You know, this isâ€¦ This is a good new lying position.â€
Then I sort of lean into my hand a little bit. I think, â€œThese hands are so soft.â€ These hands are natureâ€™s pillows. Really.
[crowd laughs]
So we would do push-ups, and then we would wrestle each other. I was in the 152-pound weight class. Based on ability, they paired me up with our teamâ€™s 102-pound wrestler.
[crowd laughs]
I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve seen a lot of 102-pound people. Uhâ€¦ These are smaller folks. Umâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Itâ€™s a little bit like wrestling your own baby. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦this magical baby would pin me multiple times per practice. It was like watching a paperweight be pinned by paper. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
So I was terrible. I mean, I was so bad. I wasnâ€™t good enough to compete or anything. But I did travel with the team, and Iâ€™d wear the same outfit. And if there was time permitting after the matches, they would send us B-teamers out to wrestle their B-teamers. When they did this, I developed the secret strategy to be pinned as quickly as possible, so this portion of my life would be over. And that strategy ran into a snag when I encountered an opponent who had the same strategy, soâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
So weâ€™re out there for a while, andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦weâ€™re flashing each other signals, like, â€œYou can pin me.â€ You know what I mean? Just like, â€œHereâ€™s my knee. Hereâ€™s my head. I canâ€™t even do push-ups. These hands are natureâ€™s pillows.â€
â€œOh, I know.â€
[crowd laughs]
So, it was like a stalemate.
But there are three starting positions in high school wrestling that move it along. Thereâ€™s the, like, â€œI hump you.â€ And then thereâ€™s the â€œyou hump me.â€
[crowd laughing]
And then thereâ€™s the â€œwho humps who.â€
And thatâ€™s sort of the neutral Greco-Roman.
â€˜Cause I believe it was the Greeks who posed the question, â€œWho humps who?â€
[crowd laughs]
And the Romans who answered, â€œEverybody.â€ Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Iâ€™m not a historian, butâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦I get into the â€œI hump youâ€ with this opposing B-teamer, and the ref blows the whistle, and somehow, and I canâ€™t even describe it to this very day, Iâ€™m pinning him, and I canâ€™t believe it. He also canâ€™t believe it. And my teammates were stunned. They cleared the bench. They go, â€œMike! Squeeze!â€ Which in wrestling means â€œsqueeze.â€ And so I squeeze. All of a sudden, thereâ€™s blood all over the mat.
[man] No!
No, I know.
[laughs]
How do you think I felt? I was like, â€œI killed this guy.â€ You know what I mean? Like, â€œIâ€™m gonna be on the run from the law for the rest of my life.â€ Birbiglia, the Wrestling Bandit. One pin, one kill.
[crowd laughs]
Couldnâ€™t do a push-up. Murdered a young boy with his bare hands.
[crowd laughs]
He called them â€œnatureâ€™s pillows.â€
[crowd laughs]
I realize itâ€™s my own blood streaming out of my nose onto the mat.
Based on no physical injury whatsoever.
Just from the sheer nervousness of possibly winning anything at all.
Myâ€¦ my body is like, â€œWhat do we do?â€
â€œLetâ€™s just bleed. Weâ€™ll figure it out tomorrow.â€
The ref blows the whistle. He goes, â€œBlood on the mat.â€
Which was obvious.
[crowd laughs]
This little blood boy runs out with a rag.
[chuckling] Wipes it down. Jogs off.
My teammates plug my nose. They go, â€œMike, you get back out there.â€
â€œYou do what you just did.â€
These fools thought that I knewâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦what I had just done.
And I jogged out.
And I get in the â€œI hump you.â€
And the ref blows the whistle, and Iâ€™m immediately pinned.
[crowd laughs]
That was the closest I would come to winning a wrestling match
for the rest of my life.
Thatâ€™s how I ended up here.
[crowd laughs]
The Vivian Beaumont Theater. Thatâ€™s how we all ended up here.
[crowd cheering]
In a sense.
So, I explained all of this to my cardiologist.
[crowd laughs]
The bullet points. The big stuff.
I said, â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s realistic that I could do cardio five days a week.â€
She said, â€œWhat about swimming? Do you like swimming?â€
[crowd chuckles]
When I was five years oldâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦my mom took me to the YMCA pool in Worcester, Massachusetts,
and I hated everything about it. It was wet.
[crowd laughs]
Sweaty. It smelled likeâ€¦ You know when youâ€™re a kid,
and your friend let you smell under their cast?
[crowd laughs]
Right. Itâ€™s like if that smell
became a building. You know what I mean?
And then someone just sprayed it down with over-chlorinated water.
I donâ€™t think they were using the right amount of chlorine in that pool.
Iâ€™m not sure they had the directions.
I think some overzealous administrator was like,
â€œOne part water, two parts chlorine.â€
They were like, â€œJanice, no!â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m just doing my job.â€
[crowd laughs]
I donâ€™t know what kind of heinous crime theyâ€™re covering up with that pool,
but I think something mightâ€™ve gone down.
Like, there was a mob hit in the middle of the night.
A bunch of goons. Theyâ€™re like, â€œDo we dig a ditch,
or do we bring the body down to the YMCA pool?â€
â€œI got a family membership. Weâ€™ll use a guest pass for the corpse.â€
â€œWe drop it in the pool. It disintegrates within six hours.â€
Itâ€™s a lot of chlorine, is what Iâ€™m getting at. Itâ€™sâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦itâ€™s so much chlorine.
Because itâ€™s so much urine. I mean, thatâ€™sâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
I know, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but, uh,
I looked it up, and itâ€™s not great out there on the internet. I mean, Iâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Well, I read about this scientific study
where these folks analyzed a 200,000-gallon public pool,
and they concluded that it contained 20 gallons ofâ€¦
[woman] Oh.
Yeah, I know. Iâ€¦
I thought this is something you should know.
[crowd laughs]
Twenty gallons of pure urine, uh, which is too much, I think. I meanâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Right? I mean, percentâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦percentage-wise, itâ€™s not that much, but if you picture it,
thatâ€™s a full tank of gas!
I mean, thatâ€™s aâ€¦ thatâ€™s a Ford F-150 full of urine,
and thatâ€™llâ€¦ thatâ€™ll get you to Pittsburgh andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
I feel like the good Christians who run the Young Menâ€™s Christian Association
are aware, uh, that there is a urine problem,
which is why there are signs everywhere
at the Y begging you not to urinateâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦in the pool. Just â€œPlease.â€
[crowd laughs]
â€œPlease donâ€™t pee in the pool.â€
Which might as well just say, â€œWhat better place to pee?â€
[crowd laughs]
â€œThe pool.â€ [chuckles]
Iâ€™m sort of obsessed with the signs at the Y â€™cause I feel like they tell you
the stories of what has occurred at the Y, you know.
Thereâ€™s that one that says, â€œSlippery when wet,â€
and you know some kid went down pretty hard on them tiles.
A frazzled lifeguard grabbed a Sharpie
and wrote, â€œSlipperyâ€¦ whenâ€¦â€
You donâ€™t see â€œwhenâ€ on a lot of signage.
[crowd laughs]
Itâ€™s not often a subordinate clause is utilized in a form that values brevity.
[crowd laughs]
â€œSlippery when wet.â€
It could just say â€œSlippery.â€
[crowd laughs]
Itâ€™s wet the majority of the time. I meanâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
There was this sign growing up that said, â€œPlease shower before entering the pool.â€
And I feel like that was written for one guy. You know what I mean? Likeâ€¦
I think the first draft of that one said, â€œGregâ€¦â€
[crowd laughs]
[laughs] Butâ€¦
[inhales] But I feel like the sign that was most flagrantly disobeyed
in my childhood at the Y
was in the locker room, and it said,
â€œPlease remain properly covered at all times.â€
And Iâ€¦ I never witnessed that.
I mean, I remember when I was five, my mom brought me
into the womenâ€™s locker room, and Iâ€™d never seen a vagina before.
And then I saw 100 vaginas.
And then when I was six, she sent me into the menâ€™s locker room.
I think the only thing more shockingâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦than 100 vaginas is 100 penisesâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦at eye level, andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦and they were grown-up penises.
Itâ€™s a surprisingly crucial detail
â€™cause I just had the six-year-old penis,
and Iâ€™m looking at the grown-up penises, and Iâ€™m thinking, â€œOh no.â€
[crowd laughs]
â€œThis is gonna be a long life.â€
And then Iâ€™m looking side-to-side for child penisesâ€¦
Please donâ€™t quote this out of context.
I feel likeâ€¦ we could end a career
with a few sloppy keystrokes, butâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
I remember that locker room so well
â€™cause when I was about seven years old, there was this old man
who would come in, probably the oldest man Iâ€™d ever seen.
Heâ€™s like 120, 130 years old.
[crowd laughs]
And he would sit on the bench in the locker room
completely naked.
I mean, he wasnâ€™t properly covered.
[crowd laughs]
Itâ€™s possible heâ€™d been peeing in the pool all day.
[crowd laughs]
And this ancient man would sort of massage his testicles
with baby powder.
Stay with me. I wanna be clearâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦I wanna be clear Iâ€™m not being intentionally gratuitous.
Iâ€™m trying to convey an accurate memory from my childhood
I feel might be humorous
if it were part of your memory also.
[crowd laughs]
The key thing about this old man
was that he was really taking his time.
[crowd laughs]
Like a rosin bag on a pitcherâ€™s mound.
Just so much patience.
[crowd laughs]
So much powder.
So I donâ€™t know if it was the blinding combination
of chlorine and urine or the jungle of eye-level genitalia
or the 175-year-old man
desperately trying to ease the friction between his scrotum and his inner thigh.
But I remember thinking, â€œI will never returnâ€¦
to the YMCA pool.â€
[crowd laughs]
So, I explain this to my cardiologist.
[crowd laughs]
At this point, it was nightfall.
We were roasting marshmallows over a burning file cabinet.
I said, â€œI donâ€™t wanna go into all the details,
but I actually do not enjoy swimming.â€
[crowd laughs]
She said, â€œI think you might wanna reconsider that.â€ You know.
â€œYou know, Itâ€™s a great sport for people your age.â€
â€œGood for increasing lung capacity.â€
I go, â€œYeah, I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s something Iâ€™m gonna do.â€
She goes, â€œDo you happen to live near a YMCA pool?â€
[crowd chuckles]
I said, â€œI do. I live a few blocks from the Brooklyn YMCA,
but I just canâ€™t picture myself going there.â€
She said, â€œI think it might be for the best
if you went to the YMCA pool.â€
I said, â€œI think Iâ€™m not gonna do whatâ€™s for the best.â€
[crowd laughs, stops]
That night Iâ€™m heading home on the subway to Brooklyn,
and Iâ€™m experiencing this shortness of breath
that I sometimes have from anxiety.
Iâ€™ve had this since I was a kid. Itâ€™s this feeling where sometimes
when Iâ€¦ [inhales]
â€¦get anxious I feel like I canâ€™t catch my breath. Andâ€¦
and itâ€™s just so bad, I feel like I might pass out.
I had this when I was really little. I remember being in the passenger seat
of my dadâ€™s car when I was a kid, and Iâ€™m experiencing shortness of breath,
and he looks over and goes, â€œWhy are you breathing like that?â€
[laughs]
Which is always helpful I find
when youâ€™re experiencing a physical difficulty
for someone to scold you until it goes away.
I amâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦Iâ€™m sure that wonâ€™t manifest itself later in life.
[crowd laughs]
But Iâ€™m experiencing it on the subway home from my doctor,
thinking about my dad and my grandfather.
My grandfather actually worked in the subway tunnels in New York, you know.
He was an electrician.
And in the â€™30s, they would blow up dynamite in these tunnels,
and theyâ€™d send the electricians in.
Theyâ€™d be the first ones in to light up these dark, dark tunnels.
Itâ€™s a very dangerous job. And then after that,
he worked at a bodega in Bushwick.
And supposedly one day,
one of his regular customers came in and said, â€œHowâ€™s it going, Joe?â€
He just keeled over the counter and died.
Which is sad.
But itâ€™s also a pretty funny response if you think about it.
[crowd laughs]
In some ways, he was the original comedian of the family.
Thatâ€™s an extraordinary level of commitment.
[crowd laughs]
But I think about him a lot, you know, because Iâ€¦ I never met him.
I live here in New York, and I never met my grandfather.
I always wish I had.
And then, when I was 19 years old,
I was in my college dorm, and I get a call from my mom.
And she said, â€œDad collapsed on the living room floor.â€
Andâ€¦ and she called 911.
They rushed him to Mass General Hospital andâ€¦
Iâ€¦ I get off the phone, and I tell my roommate, Danny.
You know how sometimes you think youâ€™re okay until you relay
the same piece of information youâ€™ve been told to somebody else?
And then, in the middle of the sentence, my voice just collapses into tears.
And I borrow a friendâ€™s car, and I drive 400 miles straight to Boston.
I see my dad in this hospital bed. Theyâ€™d saved his life.
They did an emergency angioplasty.
They put a metal stent into one of his coronary arteries.
But heâ€™s all beat up. I mean, they attached machines and wires.
I feel we donâ€™t choose what we remember from our own lives,
but there are two things I remember from that day.
The first is that it was the first time I saw my dad as a person.
And the second is that when I left visiting hours,
I didnâ€™t say I love you to my dad.
[sighs]
I wanted to.
Weâ€™re not an â€œI love youâ€ family.
Um, we sayâ€¦
â€œTake care.â€
[crowd laughs]
Itâ€™s okay for you to laugh at that â€™cause itâ€™s not the same.
Uhâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦at all. Itâ€™s actually not even that similar.
Uh, itâ€™s an unusual substitution
â€™cause, first of all, it doesnâ€™t have the word love in it.
[crowd laughs]
[laughing] Second of all, itâ€™s sort of a passive-aggressive command.
Like, â€œIâ€™m gonna need you to do something for me. Take care.â€
You know what I mean? Andâ€¦
[laughs]
Iâ€™ve tried to reverse this in subtle ways over the years.
Like, one year, for Motherâ€™s Day, I called my mom. I go, â€œMom,
I really appreciate you.â€
And it was silent on the other end for a few moments.
And then she said, â€œBye now.â€
[crowd laughs, stops]
So I get off at my subway stop in Brooklyn and I walk to my apartment
where I live with my wife, Jenny, and our daughter, Oona,
who was three years old at the time,
which is an amazing age, but if you have a child that young,
you know that your apartment becomes what would happen
if you had a rave at a bakery.
You know, itâ€™s just sparkles
and glow sticks and bubble makers.
And everyoneâ€™s like, â€œDo you have water?â€ Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦all kinds of arts and crafts.
We paint all over the walls â€™cause itâ€™s a rental.
Thereâ€™s, like, dinosaurs and people.
Itâ€™s like a creationism museum. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦that day, Jenny and Oona were making these beaded bracelets,
and Oona made me this one. She goes, â€œDad, it says â€˜Silly.'â€
â€œItâ€™s to remind you to be silly.â€ And I was like, â€œThank God.â€
[crowd laughs]
I think we all do need a reminder sometimes.
And Jenny pulls me aside. She goes, â€œMo.â€ She calls me Mo.
I call her Clo. Thereâ€™s no real story.
[crowd chuckles]
She goes, â€œMo, how did it go at the doctor?â€
And I go, â€œWell, the pulmonary test said I was having a heart attack,
and then, uh, the doctor said he didnâ€™t think I was. Soâ€¦â€
[crowd laughs]
â€œOkay?â€ Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t really know.
And sheâ€™s worried, and then because sheâ€™s worried, Iâ€™m worried.
Weâ€™re like an anxious improv group.
Likeâ€¦ I initiate with a worry.
She â€œYes, andâ€¦â€ s the worry with some misgivings.
I close out the scene with some neuroses,
and then sometimes we have sex, and thatâ€™s so fun.
Butâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦but that night, I was reading Oona a book about penguins.
And when Iâ€™m with Oona, it really melts away my anxiety
â€™cause sheâ€™s silly, you know, like the bracelet she gave me.
And she goes, â€œDad, you have yellow teeth.â€
And I go, â€œYeah. I try not to think about it too much.â€
Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦she picks up her cat puppet, Meow-Meow,
And Meow-Meow goes, â€œThose are the yellowest teeth
Iâ€™ve ever seen.â€
[crowd laughs]
Now Iâ€™m trying not to laugh â€™cause I love that Oona is funny,
but I donâ€™t want her to be an insult comic.
[crowd laughs]
And a ventriloquist, soâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦so then Iâ€™m trying to outsilly Oona, you know.
I make up a penguin joke.
I go, â€œWhat does the penguin say to her parents when sheâ€™s hungry?â€
And she says, â€œWhat?â€ And I say, â€œWaddle we have for dinner?â€
Andâ€¦ Donâ€™t feel like you have to laugh at that.
Itâ€™s not for you.
I write some jokes for you. I write some for my daughter.
What you need to know for the story
is that it killed. You know, likeâ€¦
Oona is like,
[in Boston accent] â€œAh, waddle we have for dinner!â€
Because kids love puns,
and all toddlers sort of have a Boston accent.
You know, theyâ€™reâ€¦ theyâ€™re like,
[in Boston accent] â€œIâ€™m tired.â€
Andâ€¦
And Boston toddlers, theyâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m wicked tired.â€
[crowd laughs]
Soâ€¦ so weâ€™re reading the penguin book,
and I say, â€œMomâ€™s gonna come in and brush your hair in a minute.â€
And she said, â€œSheâ€™s not your mom.â€
â€œSheâ€™s my mom.â€
I said, â€œThatâ€™s what my therapist keeps telling me.â€ Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
You like that joke. She didnâ€™t like that one.
So everybody gets their own jokes.
Thatâ€™s fun, you know, andâ€¦
I think thereâ€™s some truths to that joke.
Some people say we project onto our partner
the quality in our parent who is hardest on us.
I donâ€™t think itâ€™s entirely true.
I think the reason I married my dad is he loves me. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦sometimes I wonder why â€™cause I am a bad boy.
[crowd laughs]
So weâ€™re reading the penguin book, and Jenny comes in to brush Oonaâ€™s hair.
And sheâ€¦ she goes, â€œDo you smell that?â€
And I said, â€œWhich thing?â€
[crowd laughs]
And Jenny says, â€œMildew.â€ And I say,
â€œI canâ€™t really smell mildew â€™cause I grew up in Massachusetts,
which is a state thatâ€™s made of mildew.â€
[crowd laughs, stops]
But sheâ€™s worried about it. She goes, â€œI donâ€™t think Oona can sleep in her bed
until we get the mildew situation resolved.â€
I go, â€œOkay. Until we get it resolved, Iâ€™ll sleep in Oonaâ€™s bed,
and she can sleep in our bed.â€
And to make me feel better about this,
Jenny and Oona started calling me â€œMildew Man.â€
[crowd laughs]
So that night,
Mildew Man is lying in his daughterâ€™s mildew-scented bed alone,
and Iâ€™mâ€¦ writing in my journal.
I like to write in my journal every few nights â€™cause I find
if you write down what youâ€™re saddest about
or angriest about, you can start to see your own life as a story.
And when you see your own life as a story, sometimes you can zoom out
and encourage the main character to make better decisions.
[crowd chuckles]
That night I wrote in my journal,
â€œMy dad had a heart attack when he was 56.â€
â€œHis dad had a heart attack when he was 56, and today I realized,
when I turn 56,
Oona will be 19.â€
The next morning, I wake up,
and I walk to the Brooklyn YMCA.
[crowd laughs]
I didnâ€™t need directions. [sniffs]
[crowd laughs]
I followed the chlorine smell, and I walked up to the swim desk,
and I asked to speak with the director of aquatics.
Andâ€¦ they introduced me to a woman named Vanessa,
and I said, â€œVanessa, Iâ€™d love to take a swim lesson if possible.â€
She said, â€œIâ€™d have to come down to the pool and evaluate your level.â€
And I said, â€œNo need.â€
â€œYou can write down zero or -20.â€
â€œDrowning. Dead. Whatever the lowest is.â€
[crowd laughs]
She said, â€œI would have to see it for myself.â€
I said, â€œIs it a fetish kind of thing?â€
â€œâ€˜Cause I could do a sort of dry act out here at the desk.â€
[crowd laughs]
I walk into the locker room. I put on my swim trunks.
Iâ€™ve never worn a Speedo. I wear sort of a speedless.
Itâ€™s bunchy and always damp, even fresh out of the dryer.
And I wear my speedless down to the pool.
The first thing Vanessa says to me is, â€œWhereâ€™s your swim cap?â€
And I go, â€œI donâ€™t have a swim cap.â€
She goes, â€œItâ€™s mandatory
unless youâ€™re completely bald.â€
And I said, â€œI donâ€™t like how you leaned on the word â€˜completely.'â€
Uhâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Not even remotely bald.
I have four distinct tufts of hair that form a Voltron of hair
that lies artfully atop my head.
[crowd laughs]
This has been my hair since I was about 15.
When I was in high school,
my hair was like, â€œItâ€™s stressful around here.â€
Weâ€™re gonna lay off some strands.
[crowd laughs, stops]
Vanessa says, â€œYou can borrow my extra swim cap.â€
And then she pulls this little tiny swim cap
out of her bag, and she hands it to me.
It is significantly smaller than my head. Uhâ€¦
I have a deceptively large head.
When I was a kid,
the bullies nicknamed me â€œMike Bigheadlia.â€
[crowd laughs]
So I squeeze this tiny swim cap
onto a portion of my bigheadlia
and Vanessa points to the pool.
She says, â€œHop in the instructional lane and show me your stuff.â€
[hesitates]
[crowd laughs]
Iâ€™ve established at this point I do not have stuff.
I mean, I donâ€™t have a repertoire,
but I get in, and I just give it all I have, you know, Iâ€™mâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦Iâ€™m pretty sure I may have been swimming towards the bottom,
andâ€¦ I look like what would happen if you dropped a blender in a pool.
You know, where Iâ€™m blending the water
into a chlorine smoothie andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦the instructional lane is also the walkersâ€™ lane.
So, as Iâ€™m blending,
these elderly aggressive walkers are blowing past me.
I think one of them tried to dunk my head a little bit.
Andâ€¦ and itâ€™s packed.
Only in New York City is there traffic in the pool. [grunts]
I said, â€œVanessa!â€
â€œIs it always this crowded?â€
She says, â€œNo. Itâ€™s springtime. Everyoneâ€™s getting ready for the summer.â€
I go, â€œOh, they wanna a body like this.â€
Which was a joke.
It wasnâ€™t a stage-worthy joke.
Itâ€™s nothing I would bring to ya
at a big show here at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.
[crowd laughs]
It was sort of a conversational piece of witty repartee,
designed, uh, to create a personal bond
between me and my new swim instructor.
But she did not hear it.
Uh, she said, â€œWhat?â€ I said, â€œNothing.â€
[crowd laughs]
She said, â€œMike, I canâ€™t hear you. You have to shout.â€
[crowd laughs]
[screaming] I said, â€œVanessa!â€
[crowd laughing]
[screaming] â€œThey want a bodyâ€¦
like this.â€
[crowd laughs]
A joke without proper context
or softness of cadence or comedic delivery
is often a statement of pure insanity
because all 200 members of the pool community
simultaneously swiveled their heads to see
the bodyâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦attached to this flamboyantly confident voice, andâ€¦
I donâ€™t have a swimmerâ€™s body. I have almost a drownerâ€™s body
where it looks like Iâ€™m drowning at all times,
even when Iâ€™m not near water.
Even shirtless and dry, people are like, â€œAre you okay?â€
You know, itâ€™s sort of a river corpse body and soâ€¦
so, Iâ€™m blendingâ€¦ Iâ€™m blending water for 90 seconds
until Iâ€™m convinced Iâ€™m on the verge of my own death,
and then I stand up.
Itâ€™s about four feet of water.
Andâ€¦ I get out of the pool.
I dry myself off with 15 or 20 of those dishrag-size YMCA towels.
I put one under each foot â€™cause Vanessa explains
there can be fungus in the puddles.
And I think, â€œThis place is a death trap. I gotta get the hell out of here.â€
Iâ€™m trying to get some cardio in now, mainlining spores.
And then I walk over to the swim desk.
I go, â€œVanessa, now that youâ€™ve evaluated my level,
is it possible we could book a swim lesson?â€
She says, â€œI just donâ€™t think I have time for that in my schedule.â€
[crowd laughs, applauds]
Which means I had auditioned for swim lessons,
and I didnâ€™t get the part.
[crowd laughs]
[gulps]
Vanessa feels bad for me. She goes, â€œLook, Mike.â€
â€œIf you come in maybe Wednesdays at 8 a.m.
I could probably squeeze you in for 20 minutes.â€
â€œBut if you wanna take this seriously, I would recommend you swim on your own,
five days a week.â€
And I said, â€œI donâ€™t think anybody swims five days a week.â€
[crowd laughs]
She said, â€œA lot of people swim five days a week.â€
I said, â€œI donâ€™t even think Michael Phelps swims five days a week.â€
She said, â€œMichael Phelps definitely swims five days a week.â€
We talk about this for about 45 minutes.
[crowd laughs]
We agree to disagree.
[crowd laughs]
I started swimming one day a week.
Uh, I got into it, you know. I got my own swim cap.
I got my goggles with a lifetime guarantee to never fit your face once ever.
I got flip-flops for the fungus puddles and a lock for my locker.
And a bag with a pocket for wet bathing suits and fresh produce andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Every Wednesday at 8 a.m. Iâ€™d swim.
Then Iâ€™d go to this juice place on the corner,
and Iâ€™d get a big juice, the size of a horse bucket.
And I started to think,
â€œThis is who I am now. I swim. I juice.â€
â€œIâ€™m of the juice generation. Iâ€™m juicy. I should get those pantsâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦that say â€˜Juicyâ€™ on the ass.â€ Thatâ€™s sort of who I am now.
I think people are starting to get it, and, umâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
My favorite part about swimming is no matter how bad you are at swimming,
when youâ€™re underwater
and you kick off the wallâ€¦
for those first few moments,
you feel like an underwater explorer.
Or someone who knows how to swim.
[crowd laughs]
Then your body sort of floats to the top
â€™cause the human body has neutral buoyancy.
I love how in the pool, thereâ€™s no phones, thereâ€™s no emails, thereâ€™s no calendars.
In some ways, thereâ€™s no time.
I love how, sometimes in life, everything feels so heavy.
But when youâ€™re in the water, itâ€™s so light.
Sometimes everything in your life is so loud,
but when youâ€™re underwater, itâ€™s so quiet.
Sometimes you can even hear yourself think.
I remember one day, I thought, â€œIâ€™m just so lucky
to be alive.â€
So, for six months, I swim one day a week.
And then one day, thereâ€™s a torrential downpour in Brooklyn.
It was so bad it was raining in our kitchen.
I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve been in a kitchen, but the weather is generally mild.
It almostâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦it almost never rains in kitchens, and soâ€¦
[gulps]
â€¦we were alarmed, and we called a friend who works in construction.
We said, â€œIs it dangerous for us to live in this building?â€
Itâ€™s, like, a 100-year-old apartment building in Brooklyn.
She walks up onto the roof of the building.
She goes, â€œThereâ€™s holes in the roof and holes on the side of the building.â€
And she walks into Oonaâ€™s bedroom. She goes, â€œI think that might be mold.â€
We got it tested, and it turned out it was black mold,
which is the dangerous kind.
Itâ€™s tied to asthma and all kinds of problems. And they said,
â€œWeâ€™d recommend you move out immediately until this is resolved.â€
So we move into an Airbnb, which, by the way, no breakfastâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦which is one of the letters.
[crowd laughing]
[crowd applauds]
This is a wildly misleading acronym.
Itâ€™s like if you showed up to an AA meeting,
and theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™re live-streaming.â€ And youâ€™re likeâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€œI had heard it was sort of a private thing.â€
And theyâ€™re like, â€œPop open a wine cooler. Weâ€™re gonna dish some goss.â€
[crowd laughs]
Iâ€¦ I had found this Airbnb. I have a kind of an obsessive personality.
If you donâ€™t know someone whoâ€™s obsessive, you need to know itâ€™s a very sexy quality.
Like, your husband will disappear down an Airbnb rabbit hole for seven hours,
and when he comes up for air, heâ€™ll eat a whole box of Triscuits.
And youâ€™ll think, â€œI wanna bang this guy.â€
You know, thatâ€™sâ€¦ so that is what obsessive means. Andâ€¦
But this place I found was no good, you know.
Like, it didnâ€™t look like the photos.
Itâ€™s almost like they use one of those lenses
where they photograph a different apartment, andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦and there was no thermostat.
There was heat, but there was no way to indicate
how much heat you think might be a good idea
if you wanted to stay alive.
And so, itâ€™s three in the morning, and itâ€™s 90 degrees.
No, I know. 90 degrees.
And so, Jenny, Oona, and I are all wide awake.
And Iâ€™m desperate. Iâ€™m just wandering in the building,
trying to find a way to change the temperature.
Around 4 a.m. I find a communal thermostat in the back of the lobby,
but it is padlocked behind plexiglass.
And Iâ€™ve never done anything like this in my life.
I Hulk-smash the plexiglass.
[laughs]
[crowd laughs]
And then I change the thermostat to zero,
andâ€¦ I save my familyâ€™s lives.
Butâ€¦ the point of the story is actually that the next morning,
I overslept, and I didnâ€™t make it to my swim lesson for the first time.
And then the next week I didnâ€™t go to my swim lesson again
â€™cause it was so fun not going the first time.
[crowd laughs]
And then I stopped swimming.
And I think about this a lot, like, in a general sense, like,
â€œWhy do we stop doing the thing that we know we should be doing?â€
For me, I prioritize the thing thatâ€™ll keep me alive in the short-term
over the thing thatâ€™ll keep me alive in the long-term.
â€˜Cause if Iâ€™m not alive in the short-term, I wonâ€™t be alive in the long-term.
[crowd laughs]
So I stop swimming.
But I still had the appetite of someone who swims.
[crowd laughs]
Which is to say I was eating quite a bit. And I was, uh, juicing.
Andâ€¦
[crowd chuckles]
â€¦and I went for my annual checkup,
and Dr. Walsh asked me to step on the scale,
which, for whatever reason, is still the old-fashioned abacus thing.
Like, youâ€™re not 1,000 pounds. Youâ€™re not zero pounds.
[crowd laughing]
Youâ€™re not 970 pounds. Youâ€™re not 21 pounds.
Youâ€™re not 662 pounds. Youâ€™re not 58 pounds.
Youâ€™re not 411 pounds. Youâ€™re not 117 pounds.
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat time is it?â€
[crowd laughs]
Heâ€™s like, â€œItâ€™s not two oâ€™clock. Itâ€™s not six oâ€™clock.â€
â€œItâ€™s not 2:15. Itâ€™s not 4:45.â€
[crowd laughing]
Dr. Walsh was deeply concerned about my weight.
Uh, he said, â€œYouâ€™ve gained a lot of weight in the last year.â€
I said, â€œThatâ€™s surprising â€™cause I have been swimmingâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦as well as juicing.â€
Andâ€¦ he took my blood,
and then I took his â€™cause it was a sort of a sleepover theme. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦he calls me about a week later. I was in a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio.
He said, â€œI got your blood results back, and your bad cholesterol is bad.â€
And I go, â€œThat lines up.â€ And he said, â€œYour good cholesterol is bad.â€
I said, â€œNobodyâ€™s perfect.â€ Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦he said, â€œYou have type 2 diabetes.â€
When he said this, I had that shortness of breath I was telling you about earlier,
but there are few times in my life where Iâ€™ve experienced it to an extreme.
When I was 20, I was driving home from college for Christmas break,
and I pulled over at a rest stop to pee, and there was blood in my pee.
I had never seen blood look like this.
The moment it would hit the water, it would explode like fireworks.
And I was so worried I sped home, and I woke up my parents.
And my dad is a doctor. My mom is a nurse,
so they know bloody fireworks are not a good sign.
My dad takes me first thing in the morning to see a urologist friend of his.
And the urologist asked me to take my pants down,
and heâ€™s looking around.
I start to chime in with my own theories â€™cause I find doctors enjoy that
when you view the medical visit as sort of a collab.
[crowd laughs]
I said to my urologist, and I can never unsay this.
I said, â€œIs it possible that the blood
is from me masturbating too often?â€
[crowd laughs]
So thatâ€™s something I said.
[crowd laughs]
Out loud.
[crowd laughs]
[screaming] To my Dadâ€™s friend!
[crowd laughs]
Soâ€¦
[chuckles]
â€¦so based on his reaction,
I would venture to guess that if a urology drinking game exists,
that might be The Phrase That Pays because
he was entirely unfazed by this question. He goes, â€œNo, thatâ€™s not it.â€
And then he pounded a tumbler of whiskey
from behind his desk, andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦and he said, â€œBut Iâ€™m worried about the blood.â€
He goes, â€œIâ€™ll have you come into the hospital tomorrow morning
and give you anesthesia for a cystoscopy.â€ I didnâ€™t know what this meant.
Itâ€™s when they take a camera, and they stick it through your penis
to look into your bladder.
Youâ€™re probably thinking, â€œMike, a camera canâ€™t fitâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
[laughing]
â€¦through a penis.â€ Good news and bad news on that front.
Umâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
The good news is it can. The bad news is the same.
[crowd laughs]
So the next morning I wake up at 5:30 a.m.
My mom drives me into the hospital, and Iâ€™mâ€¦
Iâ€™m shivering, you know.
Iâ€™m in the cloth smock on the surgical gurney.
And the nurse puts the IV in, and I fall asleep.
I have to say. Even shivering and on drugs at the hospital,
I still always enjoy a nice nap.
[crowd laughs]
So, while Iâ€™m under,
the urologist finds something with the scope
and decides heâ€™ll keep me under longer so they can take it out.
So as Iâ€™m coming to, the urologist explains
that they found something in my bladder, and it could be cancer. They donâ€™t know.
And theyâ€™re gonna do a biopsy on it, and they should know in a few days.
So, from December 22nd, 1999,
until December 27th, 1999, I just thought the worst.
I just thought, â€œIâ€™m gonna die.â€ [inhales]
And Iâ€¦ I went into my bedroom at my parentsâ€™ house,
andâ€¦ and I had the shortness of breath,
butâ€¦ in a way that Iâ€™ve never experienced.
Likeâ€¦ like I didnâ€™t even talk to anybody.
Like, I didnâ€™t talk to my parents. I didnâ€™t call my friends.
Iâ€™m someone who talks quite a bit. I mean, I gathered you here.
[crowd laughs]
[laughing]
But when I thought I was gonna dieâ€¦
[hesitates] â€¦it just silenced me.
The biopsy came back a few days later, and it turns out it was cancer.
It was a malignant tumor in my bladder, but I actually was very lucky
â€™cause they caught it early enough, so they decided they wouldnâ€™t do
chemo or radiation because maybe it was an anomaly.
And maybe it was â€™cause I go for a regular cystoscopy to this day,
and it hasnâ€™t come back.
But when Dr. Walsh tells me I have diabetes,
it flashes me back to this moment.
Not because cancer and diabetes are the same,
but theyâ€™re both comorbidities, and the thing about comorbidities,
sometimes they team up
to form a singleâ€¦ [chuckles]
â€¦morbidity, you know.
Itâ€™s, â€œCancer to diabetes!â€
â€œDiabetes to heart disease. Score!â€
And they all high-five.
[crowd applauds]
And then Iâ€™m dead.
Andâ€¦ when Dr. Walsh tells me I have diabetes,
Iâ€™m actually walking from my hotel room to the front desk of the hotel
to pick up a pizza I had ordered for delivery.
Andâ€¦ Iâ€™m not proud of that.
I mean, I have bad habits.
Like, for starters, this is my job.
I mean, I do this usually in cities where I donâ€™t live.
I get up here. I work up an appetite walking over here.
Sometimes I go over here.
I slide down that thing.
[crowd laughs]
I pretend to wrestle.
[crowd laughs, stops]
Typically I get back to my hotel around eleven oâ€™clock at night
and the thing about healthy food
is it goes to bed early.
[crowd laughs]
Healthy foodâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m heading in for the night.â€
â€œI got a big morning providing nutrients.â€
Unhealthy food is like, â€œIâ€™m gonna hang.â€
â€œI saw a microwave on the corner. Iâ€™m gonna pop in and see what happens.â€
[crowd laughs]
And pizza stays up all night. Pizza loves to party, and I love pizza.
Like, my problem with pizza is when I see a pizza,
I can only view it as a single serving.
And more often than not, it was designed for a group,
and Iâ€™m physically drawn to it. Itâ€™s almost sexual.
Like, I wouldnâ€™t have sex with a pizza,
but if I ate a pizza alone, I wouldnâ€™t mention it to my wife.
Does that make sense? Like, Iâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦I love pizza so much I get excited when I see the word â€œplaza.â€
[crowd laughs, applauds]
â€˜Cause the word â€œpizzaâ€ itself is pretty exciting.
It has pizza slices in it.
Each of the Zs is two slices.
The A is a slice. Itâ€™s five slices in one word.
Which is a rarely used literary device that I inventedâ€¦
called â€œonomatopizza.â€ Nowâ€¦
[crowd laughs, applauds]
Dr. Walsh made a series of recommendations.
He goes, â€œIâ€™d like to put you on a statin for your cholesterol
and a diabetes medication.â€
I said, â€œIâ€™d prefer to deal with this without medication
â€™cause Iâ€™m a doctor also, andâ€¦â€
[crowd laughs]
I said, â€œI prefer to just sort of try to lose weight on my own
and see if I can reverse the diabetes.â€
And he said, â€œIâ€™m just not optimistic.â€
[crowd laughs]
He said, â€œItâ€™d have to be so drastic. Youâ€™d have to cut sugar, fries.â€
Then I started thinking about sugar fries, which apparently arenâ€™t technically food.
Then I started thinking, maybe they could be a food.
Itâ€™s a beautiful combination of ingredients.
Thereâ€™s an obvious theme song.
â™ª Sugar fries, sugar fries Sug-sugar fries, sugar fries in my eyes â™ª
Dr. Walsh says, â€œAre you listening to me?â€
And I said, â€œObviously Iâ€™m listening to you,
but Iâ€™m also listening to the song I just wrote in my head.â€
â€œAbout vegetables.â€
I thought it was too early to spring the sugar fries concept on him.
[crowd laughs, stops]
The next morning I fly home.
And Jenny and I take Oona to her first swim lesson,
and after the lesson,
they let the grown-ups come in the shallow end with the kids,
and Oona goes, â€œDad, letâ€™s talk underwater.â€
I go, â€œOkay.â€
Then we go underwater, and all I hear is â€œBlah blah blah.â€
She says, â€œWhat did I say?â€
I go, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
She says, â€œI love you, Dad.â€
[crowd reacts]
I said, â€œI love you too, Oona.â€
That night weâ€™re lying in bed.
Weâ€™re reading a book about the days of the week andâ€¦
sometimes when Oona doesnâ€™t know a word, sheâ€™ll just say another word.
And she said, â€œThe daysâ€¦ of us.â€
And I thought, â€œThatâ€™s better.â€
After she falls asleep, Iâ€¦
[inhales, exhales]
â€¦I started to have my shortness of breath, thinking about the diabetes diagnosis.
And Iâ€¦ I take out my journal, and I opened it up.
And I pick up a pen, and I write,
â€œI think I may die soon.â€
And the next morning, I get a call from my mom
that my dad had another heart attack, and heâ€™s okay.
Apparently heâ€™s getting the hang of it.
[crowd laughs]
He was working at the hospital, and he felt it coming on,
and he walked into the emergency room, and he was like, â€œHey.â€
Uh, likeâ€¦ I mean, I donâ€™t know exactly what he said,
but itâ€™s like a fireman walking into the station, â€œIâ€™m on fire.â€
â€œWe all know what to do.â€ Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
So I said, â€œMom, should I come home?â€
And she goes, â€œNo, heâ€™s doing okay,
and youâ€™re coming home next week for Christmas.â€
So, about a week later, Iâ€™m driving Jenny and Oona home for Christmas,
which is always sort of involved, the family events,
â€™cause Jennyâ€™s an introvert, and Iâ€™m an extrovert.
An extrovert is someone who gets energy from being around other people,
and an introvert doesnâ€™t like you.
Orâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦she might like you, but sheâ€™s gonna need me
to explain why weâ€™re leaving. Andâ€¦
it was Christmas, and Jennyâ€™s Jewish, so I have to explain.
Like, thereâ€™s this guy, andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦he was born in a barn. That usually flies under the radar.
This one went wide. Kings showed up, wise men.
Uh, although they were Jewish. Could have been the Weismanns, you know.
So, thereâ€™s kings, the Weissmans, everyone is there.
They are kvetching, and kvelling, andâ€¦ I donâ€™t know why. Itâ€™s not God. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦and Iâ€™m certainly no sort of authority in any of this.
Although Iâ€™ve got more interested in Jesus as Iâ€™ve gotten older,
which is why I brought you here this evening. Uhâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Thereâ€™s a pamphlet under your seat. No, itâ€™s aâ€¦
[laughs, applauds]
No, the truth is that my family doesnâ€™t even do a very religious Christmas.
I would say, if anything, the theme is just, like, Chicken Parmesan.
Like, we eat so much of it.
[crowd laughs]
And that year, it was a charged subject, you know.
My dad just had a heart attack, and the menu was the same, you know.
Chicken Parmesan and ziti and garlic bread,
which are all basically the same food in different shapes. Andâ€¦
my father says, â€œMichael.â€
â€œPlease pass the Chicken Parmesan.â€
And, of course, my dad just had a heart attack,
but heâ€™d also already had a serving of Chicken Parmesan.
And so Iâ€™m holding it, but Iâ€™m not passing it
â€™cause it almost feels like Iâ€™m holding, like, a bowl of guns.
[crowd laughs]
And the tension is rising, and finally I say, â€œVince.â€
We call my dad Vince. I go, â€œVince,
thatâ€™s enough Chicken Parmesan.â€
Which Iâ€™m pretty sure is a deleted scene from The Godfather.
Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦Vince hadâ€¦ [chuckles]
â€¦Vince had the perfect response.
He said, â€œMichael.â€
â€œI wanna talk to you about your type 2 diabetes.â€
And I go, â€œNo, Iâ€™m working on it.â€
â€œIâ€™m trying to change my diet like you are.â€
And then my brother Joe goes, â€œYou know, Mike, you should write a will.â€
And I thought, â€œHow did we get here?â€
I mean, you have to be really close to someone
when you tell them you have a disease for their response to be,
â€œIâ€™d love to have some of your stuff.â€
[crowd laughs]
[chuckles]
So that night weâ€™re saying goodbye to my folks,
and I have a fear
when Iâ€™m saying goodbye to my dad that it could be goodbye, you know.
I said, â€œMom, Dad.â€
â€œTake care.â€
[crowd laughs, stops]
[sighs]
I donâ€™t know why itâ€™s so hard for me to say I love you to my parents,
butâ€¦ it is.
And sometimes I feel like we get so close to it.
Like, few years ago, I called my mom after a friend of ours died.
I go, â€œMom, Iâ€™m so sorry about John Harding.â€
And she said, â€œWe were lucky because last week
he knew itâ€™d be the last time weâ€™d speak on the phone,
so we were able to tell him we loved him.â€
[crowd laughs]
Iâ€¦ I thought maybe Iâ€™ve cracked the code.
Maybe all you need is the approximate date of your own death.
Youâ€¦ you just need a literal deadline.
Soâ€¦ Iâ€™m thinking about all this as Iâ€™m driving home late that night.
Oona is asleep in the back.
And I say to my wife, I say, â€œClo,
should we write a will?â€
And she doesnâ€™t respond. Jenny and I donâ€™t have this in common.
When people ask me questions,
I feel a social responsibility to reply,
and she doesnâ€™t have that.
I mean, she ghosted me in person. And soâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦so I just took matters into my own hands.
I called a lawyer who writes wills. Weâ€™ll just call him Will.
And Jenny and I are sitting with Will at our kitchen table,
and it gets very serious right away.
He says, â€œWhat happens if Mike gets hit by a bus?â€
I said, â€œI donâ€™t know. I guess Jen gets the money?â€
He said, â€œWhat happens if you and Jen get hit by the same bus?â€
[crowd laughs]
I said, â€œOur daughter Oona gets the money?â€
He said, â€œWhoâ€™s in charge of Oona?â€
I said, â€œThe bus driver?â€
[crowd laughs]
And then it was silent for about 40 minutes.
[crowd laughs]
And of course you can get hit by the bus. I mean, this isnâ€™t an outrageous scenario.
A few years ago Iâ€™m in the back of an Uber here in New York City.
And the driver makes a left-hand turn onto the Manhattan Bridge
and hits a pedestrian.
[crowd reacts]
I know. She was okay, but she went down hard,
and then she popped up.
And said, â€œIâ€™m good!â€
You know, â€™cause New Yorkers are resilient
and often drunk butâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦but it was shocking. I mean, the first thing I thought was â€œOne star.â€
You know what I mean, like, Iâ€¦
[laughs]
Thereâ€™s an infinite number of ways any of us could die.
I read about a woman who died from a coconutâ€¦
[clicks tongue]
â€¦falling on her head, which is the ultimate example
of â€œShe did not see that coming.â€ Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦and my question is, with due all respect,
if you know someone who was killed by a coconut,
should we eat the coconut? You know what I mean?
â€˜Cause, well, itâ€™s ripe.
I read about a guy who diedâ€¦ [laughs]
â€¦during a cockroach-eating competition.
No, I know. Which part of Florida was is it in?
It was Deerfield Beach. It doesnâ€™t matter. The point isâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦weâ€™re sitting with Will at our kitchen table,
and weâ€™re filling out the â€œdeathâ€ questionnaire.
And the first few were easy. Itâ€™s like, name. â€œAll right.â€
Email. â€œCome on!â€
Day you were married. â€œWe gotta look that up.â€ You know, andâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦Will says,
â€œIâ€™m gonna go,
but Iâ€™ll leave the death questionnaire here on the kitchen table,
and if you fill it out in a few days and get it back to me,
weâ€™ll just be done with this.â€
So, the death questionnaire sits on our kitchen table for a week
and then a month.
And then three years.
[crowd laughs]
Thatâ€™s how much Jenny and I donâ€™t wanna discuss that.
But we have to. I mean, at that point, Oona was six years old.
When I was six, my grandparents died.
The Challenger exploded. I mean, that happenedâ€¦
I grew up in the â€™80s. That was live on television at school.
The teacher strolled the TVs in the class and said,
â€œToday, seven brave astronauts are going to space.â€
Actually,
weâ€™re gonna watch The Sound of Music, you know.
And we were six. Weâ€™re likeâ€¦
[screaming]
â€¦â€Where did they go?â€
[crowd laughs]
I went to a Catholic school, and so the teacher said,
â€œTheyâ€™re in a better place.â€ And I was like, â€œBetter than space?â€
â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
[crowd laughs]
When I was a kid, when someone died, thatâ€™s what the grown-up said.
â€œTheyâ€™re in a better place.â€
And I always took solace in that until I started to feel like the people
who were telling me that were not as confident as I had originally thought.
So when Iâ€™m 21, one of our best friends dies.
Mr. Naples. He was like a second father. He was at every Christmas Parmesan.
[crowd laughs]
He wasâ€¦ [laughs]
When my parents went away on vacation once a year,
Joe and I would stay with Mr. Naples, and I loved it.
It was my favorite week of the year â€™cause he was so fun and heâ€™s funny.
And he was the first person who, in my life,
who would let me in on grown-up jokes, and he was sort of, like, rich.
Youâ€™d ring his doorbell, and it wouldnâ€™t be, â€œBing bong.â€ Itâ€™d beâ€¦
[mimicking loud doorbell]
[crowd laughing]
We were like, â€œThis dude is rich.â€
â€œThat is how you spend money right there.â€
You get yourself a good doorbell game.
[crowd laughs]
When Mr. Naples is 58, he dies suddenly.
It was devastating, you know.
I remember being at the church, looking at his body, and itâ€™s embalmed.
And I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d seen a body embalmed up close.
Iâ€™m thinking, â€œIs this the best plan?â€
Just one last facial.
[crowd laughs]
Like, can we talk about the embalming thing?
Like, the person doesnâ€™t look good, right?
They look puffy andâ€¦
If weâ€™re gonna manipulate the body, why not taxidermy? Like,
â€œSo sad about Mr. Naples. But heâ€™s catching that football!â€
You know what I mean? Something with a little energy.
Give him a win on the way out.
[crowd laughs]
[laughing]
So after the funeral, we went to a friendâ€™s house,
and everybody started drinking.
I remember it so well â€™cause my parents donâ€™t really drink.
But two hours later, my parents just keep drinking.
An hour after that, my parents are drunk.
I mean, Iâ€™ve never seen them like this.
Theyâ€™re spitting when they talk. Theyâ€™re slurring their words.
It was the first time it hit me. I donâ€™t know if anyone can handle death.
So Jenny and I never finished writing our will,
but I did start to see a nutritionist, which is not the same thing.
[chuckles] Uh, but I think itâ€™s a positive step.
If you havenâ€™t seen a nutritionist, youâ€™re not missing too much.
They know the same stuff as us. Itâ€™sâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Imagine your most annoying friend,
and then imagine they start charging you.
[crowd laughs]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou know whatâ€™s healthy? Vegetables.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI had heard that
from everyone. Have you been talking to everyone?â€
[crowd laughs]
But she was very encouraging. Her name is Christina.
And she got very granular right away.
She goes, â€œHow soft are your stools?â€
And I said, â€œI donâ€™t have a point of comparison.â€ Uhâ€¦
â€œSofter than a dog, harder than a pigeon?â€
â€œI mean, whatâ€¦ whatâ€™s the metric youâ€™re looking for here?â€
â€œI didnâ€™t know we were supposed to keep track. Did I miss a meeting?â€
Iâ€™m worried about the person who has a really good answer,
like, â€œDelicate.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œUh.â€
[crowd laughs]
She said, â€œDo you have any pre-existing conditions?â€
I said, â€œI had bladder cancer. I have type 2 diabetes.â€
â€œI eat sugar fries.â€
[crowd laughs, stops]
She said, â€œHow is your sleep?â€ And I said, â€œWellâ€¦â€
And thatâ€™s a whole thing. Likeâ€¦
If youâ€™re laughing, you know the larger answer to that one.
Iâ€™ve talked about that in some of the other shows.
And if youâ€™re not laughing, the short version is
that I have a very serious sleepwalking disorder.
It got so bad when I was 25 years old,
I jumped through a second-story window of a La Quinta Inn
in Walla Walla, Washington.
When I say through, I mean through the glass.
I mean, I ended up in the emergency room.
They took glass out of my legs.
I was diagnosed with a rare thing called REM sleep behavior disorder.
So when I go to bed at night, I take medication,
and I sleep in a sleeping bag up to my neck.
And I wear mittens, so I canâ€™t open the sleeping bag.
[crowd laughs]
The long version isâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
Fine. I donâ€™t know.
Like, I got a bad case of the â€œjumping out the windows,â€ butâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
[laughs]
Christina asked a really thought-provoking question.
She goes, â€œWhen do you get your best nightâ€™s sleep?â€
And I said, â€œWhen I read â€™cause when I read, my brain is like,
â€˜Iâ€™m out.'â€ You know what I mean? Like,
I was under the impression there was a film adaptation.
I had no idea what I was getting into.
But it got me in the habit of reading every night,
but what happened was, Iâ€™d read a book, and then I wouldâ€¦ fall asleep,
and my lamp would still be on.
And so I got an app on my phone, and it is called WeMo.
Itâ€™s like a simple thing where you set a timer for 15 or 20 minutes
to shut off your lamp or whatever is plugged into the wall.
So, I set my WeMo, and I get in my sleeping bag.
I take my medication, and Iâ€™m engrossed in the book.
Inevitably, I fall asleep.
While I was asleep, the lamp would goâ€¦ [clicks tongue]
One nightâ€¦ I didnâ€™t fall asleep.
So I set my WeMo.
I get in my sleeping bag. I take my medication.
And Iâ€™m engrossed in the characters and the story,
and as the plot is reaching its climaxâ€¦
[clicks tongue]
In some ways, it was the closest Iâ€™ve come to experiencing my own death.
[crowd laughs]
I was thinking that WeMo could actually market themselves
as a sort of like a death simulator.
[crowd laughs]
They could call it WeDie.
[crowd laughs]
Or WeNoMo.
So, nowâ€¦ [laughs]
[crowd laughs]
â€¦so, now Iâ€™m going to a nutritionist. Iâ€™m doing WeNoMo.
Iâ€™m monitoring my stools. [gulps]
I started to think about this quote that has stuck with me for a long time.
About 20 years ago, the great musician Warren Zevon
was dying of terminal lung cancer, and he knew it.
It was a very sad story,
and I was watching him be interviewed by David Letterman.
Letterman said to him,
â€œYou know, experiencing this the way that you are,
what can you teach us about life and death?â€
And Warren Zevon said,
â€œEnjoy every sandwich.â€
I think for the year that I started to see a nutritionist,
I started to enjoy every sandwich. Like, when I would eat, I would just eat.
Iâ€™d still eat pizza, but I wouldnâ€™t have the whole pie.
Iâ€™d have one slice or two slices. And in some ways, I enjoyed it more.
This idea that I could sip the nectar of the gods
but not drink the whole jug.
[crowd laughs]
And after about a year of this, I went for my annual checkup,
and Dr. Walsh took my blood.
And I came back a few days later, and he said, â€œYou know, Mike,
Iâ€™m surprised to report you actually have reversed your type 2 diabetes.â€
â€œBut I want you to blow into this tube.â€
Andâ€¦ [laughs]
â€¦and so I did it. I wentâ€¦ [blows]
â€¦and he goes, â€œDo it again.â€ I wentâ€¦ [blows]
He said, â€œI wanna show you something.â€ He brings me over his computer screen.
He said, â€œWhen people your age
have healthy breathing and they blow into that tube,
the line goes a little bit like this.â€
â€œAnd when people your age have obstructed breathing pathways,
it looks a little bit more like this.â€
â€œAnd when you do itâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦it looks like this.â€
[crowd laughs]
And he said, â€œI donâ€™t know what to tell you.â€
â€œâ€˜Cause in the short-term, thereâ€™s not much we can do.â€
â€œWeâ€™ve already sent you to see a cardiologist,
but in the long-term, with your history of bladder cancer and diabetesâ€¦
itâ€™s just not ideal.â€
[crowd laughs]
[sighs]
Iâ€™d never heard my doctor sound so worried
but have no plan.
And that night, Iâ€™m lying in bed with Oona after sheâ€™s fallen asleep,
and Iâ€™m experiencing the shortness of breath.
Except this time, Iâ€™m thinking about how Iâ€™ll be thinking about my breath
for the rest of my life.
The same way since I was 20,
Iâ€™ve been thinking about the color of the water in the toilet when I pee.
The same way since I was 25, before I fall asleep,
I have a sinking fear that I might hurt myself in my sleep.
I take out my journal, and I open it up.
I pick up my pen.
Iâ€¦ I canâ€™t write anything.
And the next morning, I wake up,
and I walk to the Brooklyn YMCA, and I start swimming five days a week.
And youâ€™re probably thinking, â€œNobody swims five days a week.â€
Iâ€™m telling you, I swim five days a week.
Youâ€™re thinking, â€œMichael Phelps doesnâ€™t swim five days a week.â€
Iâ€™m telling you, Michael Phelps and Iâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦separately and at the same level, swim five days a week.
I picked up this book, uh, on breathing.
Itâ€™s called Breath. Sort of a simple start.
And, uhâ€¦ I started practicing holding my breath
for increasingly long increments of time,
which is practiced by yoga instructors and middle-school bullies.
Andâ€¦ I got better and better at it.
Sometimes I would practice underwater at the Y.
And one day, Iâ€™m swimming underwater, two-thirds the length of a lane,
and as I surface, I see a sign that Iâ€™d never noticed,
and the sign says, â€œNo breath-holding.â€
[laughs]
[crowd laughs]
I thought, â€œThatâ€™s so odd.â€ I go, â€œVanessa.â€
â€œWhat does that mean? No breath-holding.â€
She said, â€œOh, there were these two guys last summer
taking turns holding their breath like as a competition,
and then one of them died.â€
[crowd laughs]
I just want to stop you right there.
[laughs]
Uhâ€¦
You know, weâ€™re laughing about a lot of things this evening,
but right now, I think the appropriate thing
would be a moment of silence for this man who died holding his breath.
Okay, weâ€™re just gonna stop the show for a second. Umâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
[man 1 laughing loudly]
I donâ€™t wanna single anybody out,
but, uh, could we bring the house lights up for a second, please?
Sirâ€¦ uh, sir.
[crowd laughing]
Sir.
Sir, weâ€™re doing something over here right now.
Weâ€™re having a moment of silence for a man
who died holding his breath in the YMCA pool.
And youâ€™re doing something entirely different.
So, if you could just be more respectful
of this man who diedâ€¦
holding his breath.
[man 2 laughs loudly]
Okay, youâ€™re not helping.
[crowd laughs]
Soâ€¦
[laughing]
[woman laughing loudly]
You know whoâ€™s not laughing right now?
[laughing]
Do you know whoâ€™s not laughing right now?
This man who died holding his breath in the YMCA pool.
Letâ€™s just do a hard reset. Umâ€¦
â€˜Cause I think this is a well-intended group of people.
And I think if we just
get together as a group and focus, I think we can do this.
Letâ€™s just take a deep breath. [inhales deeply]
Not too long. If thereâ€™s one thing weâ€™ve learnedâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
â€¦from this man who died, it is to be judicious with the length of oneâ€™s breath when holding oneâ€™s breath.
Uh, if you could just repeat after me.
Weâ€™re gonna have a moment of silence.
[crowd repeats]
Thank you.
For this man who died.
[crowd] For this man who died.
Holding his breath.
[crowd] Holding his breath. In the YMCA pool.
[crowd] In the YMCA pool.
[laughing]
Once we have achieved.
[crowd] Once we have achieved.
This moment of silence.
[crowd] This moment of silence.
We will be rewarded.
[crowd] We will be rewarded.
With one humorous detail about his death.
[crowd laughs]
[crowd stops]
After he died, his body disintegrated within six hours.
The point isâ€¦ [laughs] â€¦the point is after I surfaced from the YMCA pool, and I see the no-breath-holding sign, I dry myself off. I pull off my swim cap. I walk into the locker room. I pull down my swim trunks.
[crowd laughs, applauds]
[laughing]
[laughing] And I sit on the bench, and Iâ€™m reminded of the old man when I was a kid. And for the first time in my life, I thought, â€œMaybe he knew something I didnâ€™t know.â€
[crowd laughs]
He was the oldest man Iâ€™d ever seen. Heâ€™d lived a long life. Heâ€™d taken care of his body. He swam. He had sensitive skin.
[crowd laughs]
Here I was, this seven-year-old kid laughing at this old man, but maybe the roadmap to my own maturity was in the veins of this manâ€™s testicles.
[crowd laughs]
[crowd stops]
The old man is dead, and weâ€™re all the old man. We will be if weâ€™re lucky. Any of us could be the man who died holding his breath in the YMCA pool, or the woman who died from a coconut falling on her head. Any of us could be diagnosed with terminal cancer. All weâ€™re promised is this moment right now, together at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. These are the days of us. And what I wanna tell my pareâ€¦

* * *
â™ª So I started to speak freely â™ª
â™ª Figured it would lead me to war or a peace treaty â™ª
â™ª And knew no matter what, end up with a deep sleep â™ª
â™ª And the habits of a soul who knows what itâ€™s seeking â™ª
â™ª Youâ€™re thinking itâ€™s a joke, but itâ€™s not folks â™ª
â™ª Itâ€™s all in the delivery â™ª
Thank you.
Thank you guys.
Thank you for coming out.
It is good to be here in Minneapolis, thank you.
Whenever Iâ€™m on tour, I have to prepare to be gone for awhile.
And so I was at the pharmacy, I was picking up my prescription for acne.
I love my acne, keeps me young.
Iâ€™m on antibiotics, theyâ€™re working.
Iâ€™ve been on them for seven years, which I heard is good for you.
Before that, I was on spironolactone, any spiro heads here?
Are you really on it?
Did it make you pee a lot?
Yes, and it made me faint.
What?
Did it thin your hair at all?
No.
Okay, we can, weâ€™ll talk more later.
It did, it made me pee a lot, it thinned my hair out, it made my boobs hurt really bad.
I grew very alarmed and I chose to do nothing.
I just waited for the follow-up appointment with the doctor and he said, â€œOh yeah, I should have told you, â€œitâ€™s going to make your boobs,â€ he actually said titties, he was like, â€œItâ€™s going to make your titties more sensitive.â€
I thought, that would have been nice to know.
Iâ€™ve been slowly saying goodbye to my family.
So Iâ€™m at the pharmacy, you canâ€™t help, but pick up other things, they designed it that way.
And Easter is my favorite season of candy.
Now, thankfully they have Peeps pretty much year-round.
So I picked up some, who knows, Flag Day peeps.
I donâ€™t look at the shape before, I barely taste when I eat.
And I also picked up a bunch of condoms â€™cause Iâ€™m the breadwinner of most of my relationships.
And Iâ€™m also not on birth control because sometimes birth control is like, I know youâ€™re hungry, but what if you cried?
So I donâ€™t do that.
And as Iâ€™m checking out the man at the pharmacy, he slides my prescription and I sign for it.
He slides the Peeps and then he goes to slide the condoms and for some reason out loud to him, I say, â€œThese arenâ€™t for me.â€
Iâ€™m a grown woman in my sixties, like Iâ€™m very open about sex, all of a sudden a man, I donâ€™t know, touches a box of condoms, and Iâ€™m like these, I would never, I got back to my car and I turned inward.
I was like, what happened back there, man?
You got weird.
I donâ€™t know, I guess if youâ€™re a dude buying condoms, maybe you feel cool.
â€˜Cause like youâ€™re gonna get laid or whatever.
I donâ€™t know how you feel.
Do you, or, heâ€™s like I donâ€™t wear condoms, because I donâ€™t get pregnant.
That always cracks me up, wen the dude chimes in with like, she trapped me with a baby.
Impossible.
You have the missing ingredient and we love to bake.
if I had all the ingredients for a cake except for the sugar, and then you, whatâ€™s your name?
Jeremy.
Jeremy brought over the sugar, weâ€™d be like this cake wouldnâ€™t be possible without Jeremy. thank you so much for this cake, Jeremy.
Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy.
Thatâ€™s right.
What Iâ€™m saying is men are garbage, but
But, women are the can, okay.
So weâ€™re in it together.
Sometimes you have to flip us over and shake us for us to let go of garbage.
But I think what it boils down to in my personal opinion, I think dudes, youâ€™re just, youâ€™re more in touch with your personal pleasure from a very early age.
Late elementary, early junior high, the boys I grew up with in Ohio were just constantly talking about jerking off or jerking off or doing this motion, which I added to my vocabulary far too soon.
I had no clue what it meant.
I would just be like, okay, mom, take a gamble.
I was punished.
Itâ€™s so high.
What are we doing with it up here?
Everybody knows, itâ€™s likeâ€¦ vi-vi-vi-viâ€¦
Like who are you jerking off thatâ€™s shoulder height.
Thatâ€™s question one from me.
Then sex ed happened in junior high.
I remember our health teacher saying I taught my sons how to masturbate.
I was like, is that legal?
I thought we were hiding it.
But young girls have sex organs, too.
Even though some of us donâ€™t look down until weâ€™re 23.
But as a kid,
I was secretly humping all kinds of stuff around the house.
I was humping the couch, I was humping the bannister, with a pillow after this splinter incident.
I was humping the edge of the bathtub.
I remember one year my mom wanted to move and I said, we canâ€™t.
My girlfriends live here.
Can you imagine if we taught our daughters to masturbate?
My mom couldâ€™ve kept decorative pillows about, instead it took like the strength of three of my closest girlfriends when we turned 18 to even go to a sex store.
Meanwhile, I feel like into adulthood, dudes, you can just hop in your car, drive somewhere, get fully jerked off.
I was a little vague.
In my head, I was thinking like a rub and tug scenario or a happy ending situation.
You know what Iâ€™m talking about?
He was like, yes, thatâ€™s how we met.
Have any women here been offered a happy ending?
Just an angry silence.
Itâ€™s more of a manâ€™s game, the happy ending.
I guess itâ€™s what we look at as like your complete and total relaxation, either that or we look at your semen as poison and weâ€™re like, get it out of them so they donâ€™t hurt anybody.
I think itâ€™s a positive thing, as long as nobodyâ€™s freaking trapped in a room.
And of course whether you know it or not, thereâ€™s tons of sex workers all around us.
The problem is whenever I get a massage, I just assume that the massage therapist is falling in love with me.
Do you do that, Iâ€™m like weâ€™re not talking, but Iâ€™m pretty sure heâ€™s impressed with my back.
And maybe my shoulders would drop two inches if somebody just offered to like, just a little bit.
But no, for a lot of reasons, a lot of liabilities, the main one being that massage therapists are not sex workers.
Thatâ€™s the big one.
It got conflated along the way.
I donâ€™t know why, maybe because people were already naked.
I feel like if somebody started offering hand jobs at the pool, lifeguards would probably suffer the same plight.
Theyâ€™re just like trying to save somebody and the personâ€™s like, yeah, choke me.
And Iâ€™m like, what the fuck?
I donâ€™t think that the female orgasm is as equated with relaxation and release.
I think itâ€™s because everyone assumes women relax by like curling up on a couch at night, underneath a quilt that we made, just warming ourselves by a fire, while we pet our cat, and sip Celestial Seasonings tea like mmm, mmm, mmm.
Iâ€™ve never orgasmed that way.
Not once, it would take so much from the cat and its little paw.
And then after an hour Iâ€™d be like, get off of me.
Iâ€™ll do it myself.
I have a good amount of guy friends that genuinely believe that they like sex more than women.
And I love orgasming.
Thereâ€™s not a woman in here who doesnâ€™t love orgasming.
Itâ€™s the sex thatâ€™s the problem.
Now, look, I assume every man in here tonight is just so good at fucking, so Iâ€™m not talking about anybody in here.
The problem is outside and we just have to take what we talk about here tonight and help them.
I try to have healthy conversations about these things.
I did a podcast recently in exchange for some tap water and two new fans.
The podcast, it was hosted by a male comedian and he wanted to talk about the Me Too movement because you gotta if you have a lady on the pod.
And his hot take was sort of the Me Too movement, well, what are we supposed to do now?
I was like, what were you doing before?
I guess keep doing or stop doing that.
Now we were doing shows together all weekend and I was the only comic on the shows who agreed to do his podcast.
So I decided to take it as an opportunity to confront him about one of his jokes that I didnâ€™t love and this podcast was never released .
We donâ€™t like to be challenged.
But he had a joke that he was performing that went like I used to fuck chicks all the time after shows.
Which is true. When a male comicâ€™s up here, itâ€™s very attractive to women, a sense of humor, and he has an hour window after the show to capitalize on that before the girl finds out like, oh my God, heâ€™s so sad.
So his joke was like, I used to fuck chicks all the time after shows.
Now, if I want to fuck a chick and she likes it rough, Iâ€™m going to need paperwork to fuck.
Insinuating that if she were also into rough sex, she would then later lie and use it to accuse him of, whatâ€™s it called when somebody wants to have sex with you, but you donâ€™t, and they do it anyway?
Rape.
Thank you, itâ€™s so much easier when somebody else brings it up.
People do not like hearing a woman comic say that word.
I guess because the dudes are like, hey, thatâ€™s our thing.
I think paperworkâ€™s a good idea.
Iâ€™m for it.
I am pro paperwork.
Just to be clear, I think itâ€™s interesting he decided to live in a profession thatâ€™s been relegated to women for the last hundred years like heâ€™d probably need me to like draw up the paperwork for him.
In which case, I could put a clause in there that says not bringing the female to climax is punishable by law.
Or something, I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m spitballing.
And then maybe a clause in there for him that says like the safe word is stop.
Give that a whirl.
It just bothered me that night after night, he was performing these jokes for crowds full of people just like you.
Well, we were in Vegas, like nothing like you.
Just scaring roomfuls of dudes about having post-Me Too sex, when most of you guys are doing it right.
Thereâ€™s probably only like one rapist in here.
I donâ€™t know, maybe two, look around, theyâ€™re not laughing.
Are you sitting here as a heterosexual man, and you donâ€™t know how to touch a woman, like get up here.
Iâ€™ll show you, Iâ€™m just kidding.
I feel like, do you know how to pet a cat?
How about that?
If youâ€™re scared during these times and youâ€™re alone with a woman, just pretend that itâ€™s a cat.
Thatâ€™s my advice for you.
Just wait for it to come up to you.
It might take a while.
Let it smell you before you pet it.
And if itâ€™s all curled up sleeping, donâ€™t pick it up.
It doesnâ€™t like that.
And then if the cat comes up to you and starts rubbing its face on your face, hard, sometimes shockingly hard, then you can ask yourself, like, is this cat trying to fuck?
And then yes, go ahead and fuck that cat.
You guys seem cool.
Maybe I was wrong and I was just overly worried for you guys.
I just didnâ€™t like that he would be scaring you, but maybe youâ€™re not scared at all, and itâ€™s just like a handful of celebrities and some very vocal comics that are scared, scared of getting accused of rape.
For some reason, itâ€™s easier to hear in a Scottish accent.
I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know why theyâ€™re scared.
Theyâ€™re going to get away with it.
If they go through this system is what Iâ€™m saying.
I was watching a famous colleague of mine yell into a microphone and he was like, so you know thereâ€™s no due process, itâ€™s fricking crazy.
A woman makes a claim and people just believe her without going through the legal system.
Iâ€™m like, ah, the legal system, or as I like to call it, the white manâ€™s FUBUâ€¦ just For Us By Us.
Itâ€™s their safe space really.
Itâ€™s why they have a checklist of things they like you to go down after youâ€™ve been raped.
Number one: did you go to the cops?
Itâ€™s like me personally, I would rather talk to Ice Tâ€™s character of a cop than a real cop if I got raped, because at least Ice T would listen and then say something like, thatâ€™s messed up.
And then when he got back to the precinct, heâ€™d probably fire something off like gotta be Mrs. Butterworth in order to make a rape charge stick.
Two: theyâ€™re always like, did you go to the hospital?
Itâ€™s like, do you guys remember at the beginning, when I thought I had breast cancer and I just waited it out.
If I got raped, I donâ€™t want to run an errand, okay.
And three: they really donâ€™t want you to use social media about it, â€™cause then other people might come forward and something might get done.
So they sort of villainize you and call you like a social justice or a hashtag warrior.
And itâ€™s like, do you guys think that Tarana Burke wanted to start the Me Too movement on Twitter?
The same website people use to talk about their Taco Bell diarrhea?
Iâ€™m thinking no, but her options were limited.
And then there will always be somebody who says, women make these claims for attention.
And Iâ€™m just like, who would want that attention?
Like, what are the benefits?
Are you imagining these women going to job interviews and saying things like, as you can see on my resume, not only have I been raped, Iâ€™ve also been doxed.
And I think youâ€™ll find that I work best in groups rather than one-on-one.
And Iâ€™m willing to work 24-7 because frankly, Iâ€™m terrified to be alone in my apartment.
And thatâ€™s just a job interview for Taco Bell.
So you can imagine, I just, I canâ€™t think of like a celebrity accuser.
The only one that comes to mind, I guess, is Lorena Bobbitt, but she didnâ€™t do that for attention.
She just got famous for disarming her assailant.
I donâ€™t know, maybe arm is generous.
Still, if I could choose a superpower, it would be penis 100%.
Iâ€™m so jealous of your dicks.
I want one to have and to hold, but like also on my person, I feel like itâ€™s easier to pee.
You can pee anywhere, shape, line, you can spell your name, Jeremy.
Is it a Y there at the end?
Really let her rip.
I also think itâ€™s easier to receive pleasure from a stranger.
Like anybody can figure it out.
Itâ€™s like up down.
I think itâ€™s cause your penises are outside of you.
Right, you know what I mean.
Heâ€™s like my dick is out right now.
But for me, more of an indoor situation, our bodies are like homes.
Some of us more an Airbnb, but we can be, we can be entered. We can be entered.
Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to knock or bring a gift.
Just because youâ€™ve come over once doesnâ€™t mean you get keys, crazy.
But dudes, you have like a fun, quick name for pleasure on the go, itâ€™s blowjob.
And then sometimes you shorten that to BJ or like beej.
But for me itâ€™s like, can I interest you in performing cunnilingus?
It sounds scientific.
Even our fun word for it, going down, has a negative connotation.
Itâ€™s like going down to hell.
Itâ€™s a little hot down there, but hypothetically, any person in here with a penis could just walk back to the bathrooms, get a quick beej to compleesh, but me, I have to walk back to the bathrooms, make sure that thereâ€™s a koala care station.
Pull it down.
Hoist my body up onto it.
Get these overalls off.
Buckle myself in, in case itâ€™s good.
And then fingers crossed that I showered.
No, but truly like if you had a long day at work and then you found out you were going to get intimate with somebody and you didnâ€™t feel fresh, you could just slip away to the bathroom and wash your dick off in the sink.
And I hope you do.
But for me itâ€™s like, have you ever tried to gut a pumpkin?
Thereâ€™s a lot of seeds.
Is my hand better or a spoon?
We canâ€™t be sure itâ€™s clean until we get a candle in here.
Youâ€™re not going to find me pants-less on the Koala Care.
I promise. Frankly, it wonâ€™t hold me.
Iâ€™m definitely more of a relationship person.
Like Iâ€™m willing to be unhappy with someone for up to three years.
Iâ€™ve also never been dumped, Iâ€™m undefeated.
Thank you, oh thank you so much.
I tend to go relationship to relationship.
I think a professional would call that codependent.
I call it college educated, okay.
I donâ€™t quit a job before I have another one lined up.
My last relationship was very on again, off again.
I would break up with him, but it wouldnâ€™t stick.
He would convince me that we were soulmates and then later complained youâ€™re always trying to change me.
Iâ€™m like, yes, exactly.
You wonâ€™t let me go, Iâ€™m making do with what I have.
He did have a big penis, he wanted me to tell you guys that.
Iâ€™m sure he still has it.
Everybody acts like thatâ€™s a good thing.
It always gave me anxiety, especially before sex.
I always felt like I was prepping myself for minor outpatient surgery.
Just in the way that heâ€™d always say, now youâ€™re going to feel a little bit of light pressure.
And then it was over.
Heâ€™d be like count back from 100, I never got into the eighties.
And then afterwards heâ€™d be standing over me like you lost a lot of fluid.
Iâ€™m like, that was you.
He would always go down on me, which you should all be doing, before sex, but he would just go down on me and then he would drool a lot all over my hoot and then look up and say, whoa, youâ€™re so wet.
That would be like if I lit the kitchen on fire and then yelled, dinnerâ€™s ready.
You cannot unlock a lock by just dousing it in WD-40.
Thereâ€™s a key.
Sometimes thereâ€™s a code.
Iâ€™m not saying Iâ€™m amazing in bed.
Like sure, Iâ€™ve gotten my 10,000 hours in and I hate to brag, but I can last forever in bed without coming.
Hours, weeks, Iâ€™ve gone a year.
I didnâ€™t even have to think about dead animals or baseball, like I was trying.
So Iâ€™ve turned to dating younger men, Iâ€™m a bit of a coug.
Thank you.
I like sleeping with younger men because you can use tactics on them in bed that you know work on younger people.
For example, you can be like, letâ€™s see how fast you can do it, Iâ€™ll time you.
Last one to comeâ€™s a rotten egg.
Iâ€™m kidding, itâ€™s me.
All my eggs are rotten, Iâ€™m 63.
Iâ€™ve been dating a guy whoâ€™s nine years younger than me.
And, when we first started dating, I had like high school feelings for him.
And I couldnâ€™t tell whether it was â€™cause he was the one or just so recently out of high school.
Heâ€™s of age, to be clear.
I donâ€™t want to creep anybody out.
I feel like Iâ€™m teaching him a lot about life, love, sober sex.
Iâ€™m raising a wonderful young man.
And heâ€™s teaching me stuff too about memes, itâ€™s mostly memes.
Iâ€™m haha, heâ€™s more LOL.
Thereâ€™s an age gap.
If you are sitting here as a relationship person, you have to be careful because, you know, you end a relationship with this high level of intimacy and when you meet someone new, you have to start over.
But itâ€™s very tempting to pick up right where you left off because you can hit it off with a stranger immediately.
And you canâ€™t always tell whether itâ€™s passion, or alcoholism, or mental illness.
Sometimes it takes a bit for that to roll out.
I was once dating this con artist.
He would prefer artist.
Three months into our relationship, I actually caught him eating one of his boogers.
Now, in his defense, there was still like a little bit of cocaine left in it, but itâ€™s a bad sign, you know, when you wish your boyfriend just ate regular boogs.
This is sort of when I wish women would talk more, you know, like give each other the review.
We keep very separate and thatâ€™s where their strength lies.
I was warned once, she was just too late, and a woman came up to me after a show and she said, hey, we need to talk.
And I thought ruh-roh.
She said, I also dated that con artist after you and a little bit during.
And she said, he gave me chlamydia.
So you might want to go get checked.
And then I went and I got checked and I didnâ€™t have it.
So I didnâ€™t need to tell you guys any of that.
I think my point was I donâ€™t know why I was drawn to this person.
Like I barely drink, Iâ€™ll have a beer.
Iâ€™ll take a little toot on the weed horn, absolutely.
But hard drugs scare me.
Like the closest Iâ€™ve come to doing cocaine is just trying to pet a guinea pig in a cage.
Have you ever done that?
Oh my God, theyâ€™re in there, theyâ€™re running around, theyâ€™re kicking up chips.
Itâ€™s like, what a rush.
Try to get your hand in and out of there without freaking out.
Your heartâ€™s gonna race, I guarantee it.
Separately, I dated a Russian DJ, naturally, and he had just told me that he was going to stop doing cocaine for me, which meant he was going to stop telling me when he did cocaine.
This is one of those like hit it off immediately situations, weâ€™re very into each other and itâ€™s like our fourth date, but Iâ€™m trying to keep it light and not latch on too soon.
And he looks at me across the table and he says, I havenâ€™t felt this way about a woman in six years.
And all I could think was just, who is she?
All I need is an Instagram handle, so I can go to her Etsy store and order one of her items and leave a cryptic review
I love women.
I hate what we do in review sections.
I do a lot of online shopping to feel whole and I order many, many items.
All of which I send back and I read a ton of reviews â€™cause Iâ€™m very careful when I waste my time.
And I will be on bloomingdales.com, looking at some inordinately expensive T-shirt where a woman has written a review that says Iâ€™m five-foot-one, 90 pounds, and swimming in a small.
Itâ€™s like we get it.
Youâ€™ve never broken a chair.
Just say it runs large, okay.
We donâ€™t need your stats, Nina.
So after this woman called me fat on the internet, I retaliated and I wrote my own review of the same t-shirt without having purchased it.
And my review, I wrote Iâ€™m five-foot-nine I graduated magna cum laude.
I have a really big one bedroom and I donâ€™t weigh myself, post.
43 people found that helpful.
I donâ€™t, I donâ€™t weigh myself.
I just ask someone to draw me.
And if they reach for a jumbo Sharpie, maybe I dial it back a bit.
If I feel like it, I like fluctuating.
It keeps it fun, keeps it fresh.
I heard itâ€™s good for your heart.
I used to weigh myself when I was chubbier, when I was working in the bagel industry.
I was in quality control.
And when I worked at the bagel shop, I ate too much, too many times, to the point where you could see it on my body.
Food is interesting like that, you show your work.
I put up some of my best numbers at the bagel shop.
It was during a time in my life where I thought that cookies might go extinct.
My top score was 198 pounds, which, Iâ€™m 5-9 as I mentioned, itâ€™s kind of nothing on my frame.
You know, 198 is not a wake-up call.
Thatâ€™s a challenge.
Youâ€™re going to get two pounds away from 200 and not hit it.
Go fuck yourself.
I did it the next day.
No matter what the scale says, I always feel good about myself.
I have like reverse body dysmorphia or something.
â€˜Cause if you donâ€™t know, regular body dysmorphia, itâ€™s when you think youâ€™re fat, but youâ€™re actually stupid.
No, thereâ€™s other reasons like mothers and being brainwashed by doctored images of other women. since the time we could see.
That oneâ€™s a little dark, but I keep it in.
I guess I wouldnâ€™t have to make jokes about this stuff if womenâ€™s worth, werenâ€™t still based on our looks but for some reason it is.
Some people know that and they think the highest compliment that they can pay a woman is like, hey, I noticed that you lost weight and you look amazing.
And that just fills us up because we are so hungry.
And if you think about it, all youâ€™re really saying is like, hey, I noticed that you take up less space and I like it.
And weâ€™re like, thank you.
Someday, I hope to not even be here.
I wish I didnâ€™t remember every negative thing somebody said to me about my body.
But itâ€™s the stuff people say to you about your appearance that you remember.
If nobody said anything, I would have been fine.
Canâ€™t see how big your ass is when youâ€™re trucking straight ahead.
I was dating a guy for a while and we went out to eat and we finished the meal.
And then I decided to order a cinnamon roll to go, just to feel safe, and he looked at me and he said, I love you, but I donâ€™t think you need that cinnamon roll.
For free, nobody there to him to say it.
So when we got back to my apartment, he asked, are you mad at me?
And I said, yes.
And he explained, I was just worried about your health.
Now to give it context, he and I had had discussions about how sometimes people whoâ€™ve been through trauma have an emotional attachment to food.
And thatâ€™s true for me.
Sometimes being full feels like a hug from the inside.
So while I appreciate his concern, Iâ€™d only gain 10 or 15 pounds and you canâ€™t die from a muffin top.
Now hereâ€™s where he tripped into a light jog out of my life.
He decided to add, â€œItâ€™s just that my therapist told me that I could tell you that I was more attracted to you when you were exercising and eating better.â€
And I thought, is your therapist your friend Sean?
â€˜Cause it sounds like Sean, who also called me crazy for making you wash your hands before sex after riding the subway, but I feel like every surgeon has to scrub in, okay.
This was all coming from a very thin person and I never asked him to eat more so it didnâ€™t feel like I was trying to snuggle with a jungle gym, or get fucked by a rhombus.
Thatâ€™s a lot of sharp angles coming at me.
Whatever, everybodyâ€™s health goals are different.
Some peopleâ€™s health goals are just being able to tell what the diarrhea was from.
I think weâ€™re finally in a good place where everybody realizes that being fat doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re unhealthy and being thin doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re healthy.
When I was 200 pounds, I lived with a girl who was a hundred pounds and she would always call herself fat. She was a German shepherd, but like she carried it well.
It affects everybody.
I know it affects men too.
Of course you guys arenâ€™t immune to body image issues, or maybe you have events in mind youâ€™d like to look good for.
I remember my sister got married during my bagel years and I made the mistake of comparing myself to one of the other bridesmaids online, which you never want to do, you know it, donâ€™t compare yourself to other people.
But I remember thinking Iâ€™m going to lose so much weight for this wedding.
And then, oh, I didnâ€™t.
I just kept being me and I got a last-minute spray tan instead.
I just showed up to my sisterâ€™s wedding looking insane, just chubby and orange, which at the time was not presidential, okay, this is years prior.
Probably started it.
I remember one of the other bridesmaids in the party pulled me aside before like the aisle part, and she said, remember Beth, today is about your sister, itâ€™s not about you.
I was like, what?
I canâ€™t help that Iâ€™m pulling focus, okay.
Iâ€™m orange and I have a dark brown upper lip.
It sticks to the fur.
Thankfully they got a divorce so those photos have been destroyed.
It always amazes me whenever my sister gets married.
You could look at it negatively.
I think itâ€™s a beautiful thing, I do.
Do you know how hard it is to put yourself out there, over and over again, and be vulnerable enough to fall in love.
Iâ€™m a full coward.
Iâ€™m very noncommittal.
If Iâ€™m ever at the altar and the pastor says, do you, Beth, take this person to be your whatever.
If so, say I do.
Iâ€™m just going to be like, eh, itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t.
I just feel weird saying it in front of everybody.
Good news is I come from a very pro-divorce family and my older sister and I, we never liked our middle sisterâ€™s first husband.
He had a Samsung Galaxy.
But I was praying that his would explode over his penis.
Is that how religion works, I just started.
I may have tweeted something to that effect, and he found the tweet, which I appreciate the follow, brother.
But he got very upset and he showed the tweet to my sister.
And he said, your sisterâ€™s tweeting about my dick getting blown off, with like the rage of a man who plays softball.
And I am going to save it and Iâ€™m going to read it to the kids to sabotage their relationship with Beth.
And I was like, whoa, I canâ€™t believe I got him to read to his kids.
My sister tried everything.
I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever planned a second or third wedding, but stuff starts flying off the truck.
You find yourself cutting corners, saying things like, maybe we donâ€™t need to walk down the aisle.
We could already be down there.
Or who needs a reception, weâ€™ll just meet at the bar.
And the dresses change over time.
Your first wedding, youâ€™re in a beautiful ball gown.
And eventually you end up in a white business suit just like, this time Iâ€™m serious.
Now of course, marriage can be a beautiful thing.
Iâ€™m thankful I donâ€™t feel the pressure to do it, but I love watching my sisters do it.
I donâ€™t love all the traditions theyâ€™ve kept.
Like I donâ€™t enjoy the bride sweepstakes, the giveaway part where our dad walks â€™em down the aisle in a white dress.
And heâ€™s like, here are the untouched goods, you take care of it.
It just feels weird, I donâ€™t want my dad giving me away, like he never had me.
I also feel thereâ€™s gotta be somebody better suited for the job.
I was thinking about it long and hard, and what I came up with was maybe my ex-boyfriend, Nick, will do it, give me away.
We had three wonderful years together.
I loved him, he loved me.
I actually have his name tattooed on my back, so he kind of owes me on this.
And I broke up with him, but heâ€™s married now, so maybe heâ€™d like to hear from me.
I donâ€™t know.
I found out he was married because of Instagram.
I still follow his sister, she hasnâ€™t blocked me yet.
And she posted this beautiful photo of him and his wife on their wedding day, which I felt like was really in my face.
I think if I asked him to do it, he would.
And then Nick could walk me down the aisle and weâ€™d get to my almost-husband, and then maybe like one last kiss and then Nick could lean into him and whisper something like thereâ€™s a little bit left, you know, or something.
I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m workshopping it.
I just want somebody to make an honest woman out of me.
And then if his wife hates the idea I could offer to get her name tattooed under his.
Itâ€™s like his name, her name, any children they have, Iâ€™m willing to do pets.
I should be arrested.
I really do have his name tattooed back there.
Do you know how hard it is to get laid with another manâ€™s name on your back?
Not hard, it isnâ€™t. Never been an issue.
Despite everything Iâ€™ve said leading up to this point, I do have a relationship with my father.
I just called him back yesterday, â€™cause he had called me on Fatherâ€™s Day and I wanted to get back.
My parents divorced when I was young and my dad moved down to Orlando, Florida to be an actor, which is not where you go.
He did, he eventually landed a role as Blackbeard at Pirateâ€™s Cove mini putt-putt golf course.
And when you know celebrities, there are going to be perks.
So my two older sisters and I, we would leave our mom in Ohio and go down to Orlando to visit our dad because it was court-ordered.
Free putt-putt, baby.
My dad would dress like a pirate from here down.
And then Alice, the manager at the time, would give my dad this huge Blackbeard head to put on top of his head that rested on his shoulders.
And then he would walk around the mini golf place making peopleâ€™s time better, question mark.
But before my dadâ€™s shift would start and before we ran off, he would pull us aside after we picked out our clubs and heâ€™d gather us around and heâ€™d get very serious and heâ€™d be like, girls, listen up, get over here.
Look at me.
Listen.
When the head goes on, look at me.
When the head goes on.
Iâ€™m not dad anymore.
Very method, okay, which from one artist to another, I respected, but I was also the youngest of the three girls.
You know when your sisters tell you to shut up?
And then two seconds later youâ€™re like, as we go on, we remember, and then they hit you and youâ€™re like, Iâ€™m sorry.
I forgot, seriously I forgot.
So I did, I forgot.
And I got a little hole in one and I started yelling for my dad instead of Blackbeard.
And he found where the sound was coming from in the head, he was like at a higher hole.
And he peeked around this blue waterfall and just looked down at us and shook the whole head, like no.
I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever disappointed a parent that has a bigger head on top of their head, but itâ€™s like triple the disappointment.
And also a little passive-aggressive, â€™cause thereâ€™s like a huge smile on the outside of the face,
But not on the inside.
After that, he could have gone anywhere, Disney, Universal, the mall, but he bucked industry standards and he started his own business thatâ€™s called Stars on Call.
He describes his work as live roadside commercials or like character directionals.
He dresses up in different costumes and he stands in front of businesses that are paying them to get people inside.
Iâ€™m sure you have people like that here, right?
Itâ€™s usually like a kid in front of Subway sandwiches with a sign and earbuds and like, fuck my life.
My dad blows those assholes out of the water.
Heâ€™s out there high-kicking.
Heâ€™s pelvic thrusting.
Thereâ€™s a lot of raising the roof.
Heâ€™s a leprechaun in front of this Irish pub called the Carry Him In.
Heâ€™s a gorilla in front of Goldâ€™s Gym.
Heâ€™s a slice of pizza.
Has anyone seen my dad?
In the Orlando area?
Real question, I like to ask, â€™cause one time I think I was in Houston, a guy went, yo, is your dad, the fireman in front of Firehouse Subs.
And I was like, yes, thatâ€™s my maker.
He also does a fairly offensive portrayal of a Mexican in front of this place called Tijuana Flats, but heâ€™s been doing it for 29 years, so at this point it is on them.
If you call my dadâ€™s number, heâ€™ll answer and heâ€™ll be like Stars on Call, this is Bert.
Yeah, you want Chef Big Butt from three to five?
No problem, Iâ€™ll send a man out.
Always him.
Nobody else works for that company.
Heâ€™s a genius.
I guess technically his wife.
He found somebody to marry him down in Orlando and sometimes sheâ€™ll zip up his morph suit.
As kids always felt like on our visits, my dad would like consistently choose our stepmom over me and my sisters, and like, I get it.
You know, she gave him head and all we had were questions.
But my dad has been in Orlando now for so long his personality is very much Fox news.
Like, I mean, heâ€™s so MAGA, heâ€™s stealing jobs from the Mexicans.
Growing up, weâ€™d have these weekly calls that you have with your divorced parents and he would spew a fairly feminist rhetoric.
He would always say, girls, remember to get the education you need to get the job you need, to get the car and the house you need.
Then worry about the husband.
And then in high school he started calling us and saying things like, if you ever get pregnant, Iâ€™ll take the baby.
What?
I donâ€™t think he meant steal it, I think he meant take it and raise it.
I wish more anti-choice people were like him.
Like if you have it, Iâ€™ll take it.
But theyâ€™re not, they just want you to have it.
And then you never hear from â€™em again.
No thank you note, no money, itâ€™s rude.
Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re wondering how hard it mustâ€™ve been for my mom to watch my dad go off and become a big starâ€¦ on call, none-the-less.
Sheâ€™s fine.
Sheâ€™s currently sleeping with this very handsome, cavalier King Charles spaniel.
His name is Nigel. She loves him.
I feel like all he does is just try to eat her food and put his dick on our good pillows.
Iâ€™ve been replaced.
She sort ofâ€¦
She likes to update me on what theyâ€™re up to if theyâ€™re hanging and stuff.
One time she sent me a photo of Nigel on the front porch.
You know when a dog like splays their back legs out equally.
So the hind is like, peuwww, you know what I mean?
I better do it.
Sorta like, when the dog is like fully flat, just like you know what I mean, itâ€™s like penis to pavement, just like cooling his dick off on the cement.
My mom sent me a photo of Nigel like this on the front porch, in the caption she wrote, itâ€™s pretty hot here.
I was like, ew.
Is this a sext?
Is this Nigel?
My momâ€¦ Can you just imagine the dog, like ticka-ticka-tickâ€¦
My mom has been out of the game for a while.
I took her on a retirement trip and we were out to eat, we must have run out of things to talk about â€™cause at the end of the meal I asked my mom, have you ever gotten a dick pic?
She goes a nickel?
I was like, what?
Never mind, I donâ€™t know why I even asked you that.
Is anybody here with their mom?
Oh you, good, I love it when people come with their mom, especially if I talk about something sexual, itâ€™s so fun to look at you guys, because youâ€™re usually like, I donâ€™t know, are we laughing?
Which I chalk up to like a sexual spectrum of mother, how moms raise their kid in regard to sex.
â€˜Cause on one side of the sexual spectrum, some moms are like, sex does not exist.
And then their kids go away to college and theyâ€™re like, yes it does.
And then there are moms on the opposite side of the sexual spectrum who say things like, hi honey, how was your orgasm?
And youâ€™re like, ew.
I will not be coming home for Thanksgiving.
Thankfully I didnâ€™t have to deal with that.
My mom is 100% a virgin.
When she does start dating, Iâ€™m going to have to ask her like, how was your date?
And then sheâ€™ll say, I donâ€™t know, we were kissing, and then his penis got sharp.
I donâ€™t have to explain it to my mom.
My sisters, on the other hand, love to bone.
They like to have sex, get fertilized, wait for it to go from embryo, to fetus, to baby.
And then they birth the baby.
Itâ€™s like their thing.
Whenever my oldest sisterâ€™s pregnant, her husband likes to announce it, and heâ€™ll always say, â€œWeâ€™re pregnant!â€
Which has historically irked some people because they feel like the woman is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.
I, however, have turned a corner and I like it, I do.
â€˜Cause it did, it took two people to do that thing, which is why I like to practice with all the men in my crowd before we go.
I just like to practice saying weâ€™re pregnant on three.
So all the men in the crowd on three, weâ€™ll say, â€œweâ€™re pregnant.â€
One, two, three.
Weâ€™re pregnant.
Okay, youâ€™re also drunk.
Not everybody did it.
If that didnâ€™t resonate with you, I guess you could just go home and practice.
Weâ€™re aborting.
Thatâ€™s honestly where we could use your help the most.
For some reason, the stigma of abortion is just fully on a woman, itâ€™s bonkers.
Back where Iâ€™m from in Ohio, they were talking about putting a woman in prison if she gets an abortion and Iâ€™m like, eh, she had an accomplice.
We havenâ€™t had a Mary since that first one.
And even then youâ€™re telling me that God stopped at one kid.
The self-restraint there is admirable.
Like God just had Jesus and then we lost him.
You think heâ€™d try again.
I just feel like mortal men, sometimes it feels like mortal men, youâ€™re more careful pouring a beer than you are with your jizz.
Just like, ooh, ooh, not too much head.
It is like the only time you say that.
And then privately youâ€™re just spreading biomedical hazard, likeâ€¦gooogggg
I donâ€™t blame you.
Nobody teaches enough about this stuff.
Some people donâ€™t even like hearing the word abortion.
But as long as birth control is hard for a lot of people to get and boners are hard to keep in condoms, theyâ€™re going to happen.
I think we just got to stop looking at abortion like leftovers.
Hear me out, keep breathing through the joke.
Imagine it like this.
Like a couple goes out for a big meal and they over-order, theyâ€™re reckless, theyâ€™re probably wasted.
And at the end of the meal, thereâ€™s a bunch of leftovers and the dude says, you take them.
And the woman says, oh, I donâ€™t want them, you take them.
And the dude says I canâ€™t, I donâ€™t have a fridge.
And she asks then why did you put it in the box?
You shouldnâ€™t have put it in the box.
Now weâ€™re going to have to throw it away.
And the dude says, â€œOkay, do you want me to like walk you to a trash can?â€
And then for some reason on the way to the trash can, thereâ€™s only random people yelling at her, like, â€œYou wasteful bitch!â€
Sheâ€™s like, what, he paid for half?
Iâ€™m just saying abortion is not really the time to go Dutch, maybe treat her.
And of course thereâ€™s a lot of good men out there.
I was living in Bloomington, Indiana, and I saw a man praying in front of the Planned Parenthood.
And I imagined that he was just saying like, dear God, please make sure that Brenda came here on Wednesday when she said she would.
So thereâ€™s some good ones.
Whenever my sisters are pregnant at the same timeâ€“ like thatâ€™s happened simultaneously a couple timesâ€“ people canâ€™t help themselves, they always ask me like, did they plan it?
Iâ€™m just like what does that look like for you?
Do you think one of my sisters called the other and said, hey, whatâ€™s up, what are you doing?
And the other was like, I donâ€™t know, what are you doing?
No. I donâ€™t know what the season is for unprotected sex, but I think itâ€™s always in Ohio.
I have so many nieces and nephews running around, I canâ€™t keep track.
Sometimes I just have to wait for them to like play in a group, and then I shout out a name like, â€œCharlotteâ€ and wait for one to turn.
Get over here, letâ€™s connect.
I donâ€™t even know what I would name kids if I had them.
Obviously Jeremy, your parents struggled.
I had a friend who actually named their daughter Harbor because she and her husband conceived her in this beautiful hotel in a harbor, which is truly disturbing.
If my family did that, we would have so many Alleys and Sofas.
Maybe like one The Woods, Iâ€™m from Ohio.
And then what, theyâ€™re just supposed to call me mom?
Thereâ€™s already so many.
I didnâ€™t even know my mom had a first name until recently.
Iâ€™d just been calling her mom for so long.
And then she phoned me up and asked why havenâ€™t you followed me back on Instagram?
I was like, whoâ€™s Diane?
I donâ€™t even know if I would respond to mom.
Iâ€™ve been called a female comic Ss many times Iâ€™d respond better to girl daddy.
Just imagine my future imaginary son, like the last to get picked up, at probably afternoon kindergarten.
And his teacher walks over to him and asks, Van, is your mother coming?
And then heâ€™ll be like, no, my girl dad is, sheâ€™s just always late.
Sheâ€™s probably picking up my sister, Shallow Grave.
You guys have been so great.
Thank you for listening.
Thank you so much.
â™ª So I started to speak freely â™ª
â™ª Figured it would lead me to a war or peace treaty â™ª
â™ª And knew no matter what end up with a deep sleep â™ª
â™ª The habits of a soul who knows what itâ€™s seeking â™ª
â™ª Youâ€™re thinking itâ€™s a joke, but itâ€™s not, folks â™ª
â™ª Itâ€™s all in the delivery â™ª
â™ª See underneath my smileâ€™s a symphony â™ª
â™ª I style the epiphany like Tiffanyâ€™s â™ª
â™ª Then pivot and point out the irony â™ª
â™ª And leave you pitted in the middle of my diary â™ª
â™ª See everything inspires me â™ª
â™ª And I know better, Iâ€™m no better â™ª
â™ª I have made mistakes that could ruin or you admire me â™ª
â™ª And maybe if the stakes were graded, one day it happened â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™d be asked out and pushed packing for my retirement â™ª
â™ª I practice what I preach and preach what I have practiced â™ª
â™ª When weâ€™re wrong, ask forgiveness â™ª
â™ª And takinâ€™ blame entirely â™ª
â™ª If every lying liarâ€™s pants were on fire in my city â™ª
â™ª Weâ€™d need the whole lake in its entirety, yeah â™ª
â™ª Hypocrisy is in an apocalyptic prophecy â™ª
â™ª Destined to pop off and pop with an apostrophe â™ª
â™ª And what itâ€™s costing me is obvious â™ª
â™ª This is proudly, itâ€™s preposterous â™ª
â™ª Itâ€™s going for drinks with Bill Cosby-ous â™ª
â™ª This apocalyptic prophecy, destined to pop off â™ª
â™ª And pop with an apostrophe. â™ª
â™ª And what itâ€™s costing me is obvious. â™ª

[loud bang]
[rock music playing]
[crowd cheering]
[mouthing] Thank you, guys. Whatâ€™s up, Dayton? Thank you.
[rock music ends]
[sucks teeth] Iâ€™m gonna set up my little office here. Iâ€™m gonna need these glasses later. Myâ€¦ My vision is declining rapidly. [crowd laughs] Anybody else feel like theyâ€™ve been aging in dog years? [crowd laughs] Everything to me looks like, you know, those public park restroom mirrors that are just a buffed sheet of metal? [crowd laughs] [exhales sharply] Iâ€™m getting ready like, â€œIâ€™m seeing a general outline here.â€ [groans] â€œThatâ€™ll do.â€ [crowd laughs] I have a whole new appreciation for my teachers in their sixties growing up, who always had, like, mascara right hereâ€¦ [laughs] â€¦and a buzz cut situation. [laughs] I mean, I get it. Work smarter, not harder. [crowd laughs] And now is also the perfect time to announce I plan to age.
[crowd laughs]
[chuckles] Thank you.
[crowd cheering, applauding] Naturally, ideally from the comfort of my own home. Somebodyâ€™s got to do it. We need a control group in Los Angeles. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] Otherwise, we wonâ€™t know what old ladies look like. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] So I volunteer. [crowd laughs] If I do get surgery, itâ€™s going to be a lobotomy. [chuckles]
[crowd laughs]
[inhales] My friend Monica wants one too, and I just told her, â€œFuck it, letâ€™s get our heads done!â€ [crowd laughs] Letâ€™s get our heads done. [crowd laughs] I ran that joke by my mom first, andâ€¦ [laughs] â€¦her response was, â€œWouldnâ€™t that be nice?â€
[crowd laughs, applauds]
[chuckling] Curveball Diane. [scoffs] [inhales deeply] The pandemic was rough on us all. [chuckles]
[crowd laughs]
I used to be able to shock her. [laughs] Not anymore. Iâ€™m very grateful for my mom. She raised me and my two older sisters, who Iâ€™m very close with. I met them through my mom in the late â€™80s, andâ€¦ weâ€™ve remained close. My momâ€™s cool. She absolutely loves the Olympics. Sheâ€™s obsessed. Huge o-head. Her words. [crowd laughs] Sheâ€™s also pretty big fan of me. You know, she wonâ€™t stop texting. Andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
She likes to hype me up, you know, before shows. And one time, before a show, she said to me, â€œBethy, you are so good at stand-up comedy.â€ â€œIf it were an Olympic eventâ€¦ [crowd laughs] â€¦you would win gold in the womenâ€™s stand-up comedy.â€ [crowd laughs, applauds] [cheering] She did raise us right here in Dayton, Ohio. [crowd cheering] [Beth] Mmm. I knew you guys would be happy for me. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] Not everybody shows us the respect we deserve. You know, weâ€™re the birthplace of aviation.
[crowd cheering]
Yeah. North Carolina has been coming for us for years. [crowd laughs] Their license plates say, â€œfirst in flight.â€ [scoffs] Itâ€™s like, â€œOkay.â€ [crowd laughs] It was built in Dayton. We just used you for your wind. [crowd laughs, applauds] [crowd cheering] [Beth chuckling] The flights were short. They meant nothing to them! Shitty hawk. [crowd laughs, applauds] [Beth chuckling] My passions have changed since you saw me last. [scoffs] Iâ€™m very into aviation now. [crowd laughs] Nah. We all spent the last couple of years differently. Me personally, I searched the Wright brothers on the internet a couple times. [chuckles] Just to learn about my heritage, the city I come from. [sucks teeth] Itâ€™s funny how our whole motto is based upon two men who literally wanted to fly away. [laughs] And they couldnâ€™t.
[crowd laughs]
[laughs, sighs]
[crowd applauds, cheers] Nonetheless, back in 1892, Wilbur and Orville, they had a bike shop. They were old before they flew. [crowd laughs] I thought they did popcorn for a bit, but that is Redenbacher. [crowd laughs loudly] Now, you can still go visit it, the original bike shopâ€¦ The first one has been torn down, as Iâ€™m sure everybody here knows. Uhâ€¦ [chuckles] I believe thereâ€™s a credit union or something, but you can still visit the fourth one overâ€¦ over on Williams. You can poke your head in there, yeah, see all the photos ofâ€¦ of Wilbur and Orville working on the bikes. And thereâ€™s another dude in there helping them. Thereâ€™s no ladies working at the bike shop. [clicking tongue] [crowd laughs] If they let us in there, we would have gotten to Peloton much faster. [crowd laughing, cheering] And the seats would have been more comfortable too. [crowd laughs] No, I realize itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s silly to get your tail in a knot over firsts. Like, he was first to do something, because I guess you got to ask, â€œWere you first, or were you the only one allowed to do it?â€ [chuckles] [crowd laughs] He was that one. [chuckles] [crowd cheering] Iâ€™m scratchy.
This is Sleepytime tea. [laughs]
[crowd laughs] [chuckles] Iâ€™m just, likeâ€¦ [snores] My, umâ€¦ [smacks lips] â€¦my mom is a pianist, which was funny for a while. [crowd laughs] She taught elementary school music, uh, for 34 years, and I wouldâ€¦ I grew up going to visit her classroom even into college. And one time I was visiting her class. She had a second grade group in there. And she was teaching them that song, one, two, buckle, my shoe, three four shut theâ€¦ You know, classic. [crowd laughs] She has all the kids in a circle. Circles are huge in the music industry. [crowd laughs] And sheâ€™s having them finish, you know, like one, two, three, four, five, six. She gets to nine, ten, and she points to this little second grade boy. She says, â€œNine, ten,â€ and he goes, â€œBig fat asshole.â€ [laughs] [crowd laughs] I literally had to steady myself on the door frame. I was laughing so hard. My mom was like, â€œJonathan, you go sit by the door!â€ [chuckles] I was like, â€œNot over here. Heâ€™s killing.â€ [Beth laughs] Nine, ten, big fat asshole? [laughing] It doesnâ€™t even rhyme. [grunting] This kidâ€™s a genius. What, was he just saving it up all day for Dianeâ€™s class? Knowing that the worst that would happen to him was like, â€œJonathan, you go sit by the door.â€ â€œYouâ€™re too young to be alone in the hallway, but youâ€™re out of the circle!â€
[crowd laughs]
[laughing] I donâ€™t even know how old second grade is. Nobody tell me.
[crowd chuckles]
I was like, â€œWhere did he get that?â€ â€œWas it a dare?â€ I personally like to think he probably heard it at home, or some version of it. [laughs] But I have a wild imagination, so. I like to think it was probably his momâ€¦ [chuckles] [crowd laughing] â€¦saying it to his dad. [chuckles] â€œYouâ€™ve been gone from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., you big fat asshole!â€ [crowd laughing] â€œI could use a little help.â€ â€œEspecially from five to six, when youâ€™re probably out sucking dicks!â€ [crowd laughing] â€œTry to come home again at 3 or 4.â€ â€œIâ€™m going to shut the door in your big fat asshole face!â€
[crowd laughs, applauds]
â€œOh, Jonathan, Iâ€™m sorry you had to see that.â€ [crowd laughs] [sighs] That is his real name. Iâ€¦ [crowd laughs] Iâ€™ve left it his real name in case he needs to find me, uhâ€¦ [crowd laughs] [Beth chuckles] I wanna know the truth. He should be making his way to the stand-up scene any day now, andâ€¦ Iâ€™ll ask him myself. [crowd chuckles] She also did the high school chorus, and that was after school. So Iâ€™d go over there, so I wouldnâ€™t have to have a babysitter. And she would have the chorus up on the risers. And I would be in the aisles doing cartwheels and back walkovers, some splits and stuff, trying to get the high school boysâ€™ attention. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I had crushes on all of them. They were up here, singing their hearts out. It was hot. [crowd laughs] And I donâ€™t know, I was probably in, like, third or fourth grade. Youâ€™re a gymnast when youâ€™re young because youâ€™re unaware of the many ways that your neck can break. [crowd laughs] And thereâ€™s a lot of benefits to being a gymnast. You know, youâ€™re strong, youâ€™re flexible, the leotards and stuff. [inhales] My mom used to describe my legs as tree trunks, which I tried to explain was damaging, butâ€¦ now I love it, you know? You could parkour off these babies. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] Iâ€™m probably going to end up doing aâ€¦ [sucks teeth] â€¦open-leg casket.
[crowd laughs]
Soâ€¦ chorus is up here. Iâ€™m in the aisles. I have a huge crush on this baritone named Tim. And my mom makes the mistake of letting Tim babysit for me.
Very dangerous.
[crowd laughs] For him. My love language is sexual harassment. [chuckles] [crowd laughs loudly] Most of the time he spent babysitting, he was stiff-arming the top of my head. Likeâ€¦ [chuckles] While I was likeâ€¦ [roaring] [chuckling] Like this, trying to touch his junk.
[crowd laughs]
We were an all-female household. I had curiosities. [sucks teeth] But Timâ€¦ Tim was very good to me, uhâ€¦ He took me to the gas station to get candy. Um, he got me a stuffed elephant one year for my birthday. Point is, good guy. [man laughs] And then moreâ€¦ It could have been his laugh. [crowd laughs] Recently, I actually ran into Tim at the grocery store, at Dorothy Lane Market.
[crowd cheering]
[laughs] Some fans of the Killer Brownie. [crowd laughs] So, Tim and I were catching up, and heâ€™s like, â€œBee, oh my gosh, itâ€™s been ages.â€ And we were talking and chatting. And he was like, â€œOh my gosh, Iâ€™m so happy for everything that youâ€™re up to.â€ And then Tim asked me out on a date.
[crowd cheers]
Thank you. [crowd laughs] And I just looked at him and I saidâ€¦ [chuckling] â€œIf you didnâ€™t want me thenâ€¦â€ [crowd laughing] [chuckling] Bit of a pedophile joke. I think it was fun. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] You have to be careful with pedophilia because you can catch it just by touching a kid. [chuckles]
Itâ€™sâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
[chuckling]
[crowd applauds] [inhales deeply] Mmm. So, we had guinea pigs growing up, and we kept them in our garage. And in the hot Ohio summers, they absolutely died in there. [crowd laughs] And my sister reminded meâ€¦ [chuckles] â€¦we named one of the pigs Brownie, which, in retrospect, is extra sad. She was out there straight baking at 375.
[crowd laughs]
[sucks teeth] And my mom felt awful, okay? So she let us give him a proper burial in the backyard. And me and my sisters took those hard-bodied pigsâ€¦ Not like ripped, but rigor mortis hard. Andâ€¦ we buried them in the easiest place to dig. We put them right in the sandbox. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Then a couple of neighborhood dogs came alongâ€¦ [snores] â€¦snarfed them right up. [chuckling] It was a tragedy all around, and I really feel like it could have been avoided if we just had a dad. [chuckles] [crowd laughing] I donâ€™t know what dads do. But I assume itâ€™s regulate the garage temp. [crowd laughs] Theyâ€™re always in there tinkering around, planning their escape. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] No, my dad didnâ€™t escape as much as he was asked to leave.
[chuckles] Escorted off the premises.
[crowd laughs] Some of you know this about myâ€¦ my dad. When I was little, he moved down to Orlando, Florida, to become an actor, which is not where you go. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] He did land a few gigs. Uh, heâ€¦ he was an extra in the television series of Swamp Thing. Uh, he was a truck driver in that. Andâ€¦ thatâ€™s it.
Umâ€¦
[crowd laughs] [chuckles] Then he took things into his own hands, started his own business, and now heâ€™s in the sign spinning biz. He calls it live roadside commercials, orâ€¦ or character directionals. He likes to devise a character and then present it to the cars.
Umâ€¦
[crowd laughs] Heâ€™s a leprechaun in front of this Irish pub called the Kerryman, for example, and the rest of his characters are available on his website. [crowd laughs] [sucks teeth] So, we grew up around a lot of costumes, like thrifting and going to Rayâ€™s Circus of Value and stuff. For example, he loves a morphsuit. You know what those are?
[man] No.
[woman] Yeah.
Itâ€™s like what Olympic speed skaters wear, but thereâ€™s no hole cut for your face.
[crowd laughs]
So youâ€™re just in a single Lycra suit, just one color head to toe, no skinâ€™s showing. He wears an orange one in front of the Orange Julius. [crowd laughs] I donâ€™t know how the silhouette of my dadâ€™s penis sells smoothies, butâ€¦ [chuckles] That was a bit of a tongue twister. I really got through it. â€œSilhouette of my dadâ€™s penis sells smoothies.â€
[crowd laughs]
He heard me say that, and he was like, â€œI wear shorts over it. Iâ€™m family-friendly.â€ [chuckles] All right. [Beth chuckling] It doesnâ€™t rain that often in Orlando, and he called me one time after a shift. He said, â€œThere was a sudden downpour, and I almost waterboarded myself.â€ â€œI was likeâ€¦â€ [panting] â€œâ€¦I couldnâ€™t breathe.â€ â€œIt was stuck to my face. My fingers were covered.â€ â€œThe zipperâ€™s on the back of my head. I nearly died.â€ [crowd laughs] â€œI had to get into the car. I was so embarrassed.â€ [chuckles] I was like, â€œItâ€™s only embarrassing when itâ€™s wet?â€
[crowd laughs]
[Beth chuckles] Anyway, he made it out. So, my sisters and I would have to leave our mom here in Dayton and go visit our dad as kids in Orlando because it was court-ordered. Andâ€¦ [chuckles] â€¦we didnâ€™t have a ton to do down there, uh, because we didnâ€™t go to school, so we, like, couldnâ€™t make friends, and all the neighbors wereâ€¦ old or from Florida.
Uhâ€¦ [laughs]
[crowd laughs] So we did a lot of playing in the costumes. And there were a ton of them. The garage was wall-to-wall filled with costumes. Sometimes, we would find strangers in there. [crowd laughs] Because they thought it was a garage sale. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] So, one night, it was just me and my oldest sister, Meghan, weâ€™re playing in the costumes, doing a photo shoot. [inhales] I put on, um, this, like, muscle tee. You know what I mean? A muscle tee, but then thereâ€™s huge latex muscles that you put your arms through. And then a brown curly wig, and, um, it just wasnâ€™t working for me. I was like, â€œWhatâ€™s my motivation?â€ You know? Soâ€¦ Then Meghan put on this, like, gray pinstripe suit, a Dick Tracy hat, and some wingtip shoes. And sheâ€¦ It was really working for her. Uh, she was feeling herself. And so I decided to go with something fresh, unopened. I went and put on this full red lace bodysuit. And then we whipped up the tunes, we were dancing around. Meghan is, like, six years older than me. Weâ€™re dancing. I do a high kick, and Meghan goes, â€œOh my God, Beth!â€ [inhales] â€œThereâ€™s a hole in the crotch of that.â€ [crowd laughs] [exhales sharply] I was like, â€œCool!â€
[crowd laughs]
â€œSo you can pee?â€ [chuckling] She was like, â€œUm, yeah, take it off right now.â€ [crowd laughing] [chuckles] I was just a sixth grader in a sex suit. Thenâ€¦ [chuckles] This is when my dad comes in. I believe we were told to be quiet. Andâ€¦ Heâ€™sâ€¦ He pokes his head in. Heâ€™s like, â€œGirls, get out here. Youâ€™re gonna want to see this.â€ And we were like, â€œDo we want to see whatâ€™s in your backyard at midnight in Orlando, Florida?â€ What we didnâ€™t expect to see were just 18 raccoons eating out of a huge trough of dog food that he provided them.
[crowd laughs]
He goes, â€œI threw in some Hershey Kisses.â€ [chuckles] â€œEven raccoons deserve dessert.â€ [chuckles] I was like, â€œThat I agree with, honestly.â€ â€œEverybody deserves dessert. Otherwise, this is disgusting.â€ He said, â€œDonâ€™t worry, Bee.â€ â€œEvery night, after theyâ€™re done eating, I bleach the deck.â€ [chuckling] â€œWhat?â€ â€œYouâ€™re telling me youâ€™ve created for yourself a 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. unpaid raccoon internship?â€ [crowd laughs] â€œTake back your life, man.â€ As you can imagine, over the years, the numbers skyrocketed exponentially. He was helping rodents flourish in the back. He told me recently theyâ€™re actually mammals from the weasel family. [chuckles] Well, I thought the highest the number got was 73. But he FaceTimed me a couple of weeks ago. I didnâ€™t pick up, andâ€¦ [chuckles] â€¦if I donâ€™t pick up, heâ€™ll text right away. Heâ€™s like, â€œBeth, this is your dad.â€ [chuckles] So our whole text thread is just like, â€œBeth, this is your dad.â€ â€œBeth, this is your dad.â€ â€œBeth, this is your dad.â€ [laughs] Which seems weird, but, like, heâ€™s right. I never save his number.
So, itâ€™s good.
[crowd laughs] [smacks lips] But he told me that the highest it actually got was 91. Ninety-one raccoons. But back when it was still in the forties, umâ€¦ my sister decided to calculate how much he was spending on dog food per year, because she was hoping to go to college, andâ€¦
[crowd laughs]
[smacks lips] â€¦apparently he was spending $4,000 a year on dog food. Didnâ€™t calculate the Hershey Kisses. Apparently those are marginal. [crowd chuckles] He goes, â€œI know itâ€™s a problem.â€ â€œBut on the off nights I donâ€™t feed â€™em, they take their long skinny fingers, they pick up rocks from the rock garden, and they roll them up and down against my bedroom window until I come out and feed â€™em.â€ [silent scream] [chuckling] â€œWhat?â€ [chuckles] â€œCall an exterminator immediately!â€ But I just didnâ€™t think about what the phone call would be like for him. Just like, â€œYeah, we got a little bit of a raccoon problem on our hands.â€ â€œHow many?â€ [sucks teeth] â€œExactly 91.â€ [crowd laughing] â€œDo you need their names orâ€¦ No? Okay.â€ â€œHow did it happen?â€ â€œWhoo! My goodness.â€ â€œI got to tell you, uh, direct result of my actions.â€ [crowd laughs] So, itâ€™s like far too expensive to exterminate. Soâ€¦ And plus, it would be a literal genocide. Iâ€¦ [laughs] Ninety-one raccoon carcasses. Itâ€™s like up to here. Soâ€¦ he decides to go with trapping and releasing into the wild. He bought two traps, but they were expensive. So he made one of his own, which I imagine was just a piece of fruit in his mouth, and his open arms. Likeâ€¦ [crowd laughing, applauding] [laughing] He was taking them one by one. [chuckles] He was releasing them into the wild. He was very proud because it took so long, so he liked to update me. Heâ€™s like, â€œSo far, Iâ€™ve got 39 raccoons, two possums, and a black cat.â€
[crowd laughing]
â€œThereâ€™s still a bunch of them out there. Biguns.â€ He was taking them in his car. He drives a Geo, which is essentially a roller skate. [crowd laughing] Andâ€¦ he was putting a blanket over the cage. I was like, â€œSo they canâ€™t find their way back orâ€¦â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œI didnâ€™t want them to get rattled.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œBut still, they poke their fingers through the blanket, and they sound like Halloween.â€ [crowd laughing] [scoffs] I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ve painted a good picture of my father thus far, butâ€¦ [crowd laughs loudly] â€¦this is the same man who visited me in Chicago once, when I was living there, and he described riding the L train â€œlike Jurassic Park.â€ [chuckles] So I have no clue what heâ€™s talking about when he says â€œthey sound like Halloween.â€ Whether itâ€™s likeâ€¦ [mimics suspenseful music] Like one of those ghosts you walk by at CVS. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ [mimics a ghost moaning] [laughs, sighs] Heâ€™s like, â€œDid I tell you one of them got out in the car?â€ [crowd laughing] I was like, â€œNo, but it sounds like you do want to tell me.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œThankfully, I was just outside the driveway, so I open the back hatch, it hissed at me, and I drove off.â€ [chuckles] I was like, â€œBeen there.â€
[crowd laughs]
He was takingâ€¦ When he said â€œreleasing them into the wild,â€ I thought he was taking them to his neighborsâ€™ trash cans. Like, â€œOne for you. One for you. One for you.â€ But on that FaceTimeâ€¦ I did call him back, and he told me, â€œListen. News developed.â€ He said, uh, â€œUnder the cover of night, Iâ€™ve been taking them over to the Kerryman because thereâ€™s a fresh water source.â€ Now, if you recall, the Kerryman is where my dad is a leprechaun in front of. Soâ€¦ [chuckles] â€¦he just increased his job description to, like, â€œGet in here for the lunch deals, and donâ€™t look at all these raccoons I dropped off.â€ [crowd laughs] So he goes, â€œI finally got down to the lead raccoon.â€ â€œAnd I walked him over there. I put his cage down in the grass, and I just was standing there in my swim trunks.â€ [chuckling] I was like, â€œWere you baptizing them before they left?â€ [crowd laughs] Heâ€™s like, â€œAnd Snorkie walked right out of his cage.â€ â€œThey donâ€™t always do.â€ â€œAnd he walked over to me, and with his bare handâ€¦â€ [laughing] Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat else would it be?â€ [crowd laughs] Were you putting them in little outfits? â€œIâ€™m gonna need the gloves back, my guy.â€ â€œAnd the top hat as well. Yeah.â€ â€œThank you so much. Keep the cane. Youâ€™re gonna need it.â€ He goes, â€œSnorkie walked over to me, and with his bare hand, he went like this on my crock.â€ [crowd laughing] â€œAs if to say, â€˜Thank you.'â€ [chuckles] I was like, â€œYeah, or as if to be like, â€˜Hereâ€™s rabies, bitch.'â€
[crowd laughs]
â€œThanks for ruining me and my closest 90 relativesâ€™ lives.â€ â€œYou know what doesnâ€™t grow out here? Dog food and Hershey Kisses.â€ â€œWeâ€™re fâ€™ed!â€ â€œTake me back.â€ [laughs] [crowd laughs] Only difference between me and the raccoons is Iâ€™ve never been on a Christmas card.
Uhâ€¦ [laughs]
[crowd laughs] Iâ€™m fine with it. Iâ€™m at peace. [chuckles] I always liked spending Christmas here better. It always feels weird to have a warm Christmas. I also feel like, because I grew up here in Dayton, I got most of my alcohol drinking out of the way in eighth grade. [crowd laughs] And then, by the time high school rolled around, I was pretty grizzled, you know? [chuckles] â€œI gotta get my shit together.â€
[crowd laughing, applauding]
Who else is going to lead this field hockey team to State for the first time in 15 years? [crowd cheering] For those of you, uh, that donâ€™t know, field hockey is a sport, andâ€¦ [crowd laughing] â€¦you play it with a stick andâ€¦ and a ball. People used to call us â€œChicks with Sticksâ€¦â€ [chuckles] â€¦and then inevitably â€œChicks with Dicks.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œWho would want to get penetrated by a long wooden stick when I have a perfectly good mouth and finger?â€ No, Iâ€™m just kidding. Iâ€¦ [laughs] No, Iâ€™ve actuallyâ€¦ Iâ€™ve neverâ€¦ or I should say, I havenâ€™t yet gone down on a woman. Umâ€¦ I have had a man go down on me so badly, Iâ€™ve thought, like, â€œLet me down there.â€ [chuckles] [inhales] â€œJust to see.â€ [chuckles, inhales] â€œIt canâ€™t be that hard.â€ [chuckles] Especially if you love her. Okay. Back to my eighth grade drinking problem. [crowd laughs, applauds] [laughs, sighs] We would, uhâ€¦ We would sleep over at Maryâ€™s house, and we would sneak out around midnight, cross Irving into the University of Dayton.[crowd cheers]
Well, you might want to wait. Uhâ€¦
[crowd laughs] [laughs] We would wander into a frat house, get hammered, and then some of my girlfriends would hook up with the frat dudes. See? [laughs] A little rugged to think about college dudes hooking up with eighth grade girls. [chuckles] I feel like the only time men believe women is when weâ€™re lying about being 18. [laughs] [crowd laughs] [Beth sighs loudly] [crowd cheering, applauding] [laughs] Frat dudes are like, â€œWhat am I supposed to do? Check her ID?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œCheckâ€¦ [hesitates] â€¦check her face.â€
[crowd laughs]
[chuckles] Is it underdeveloped and over-contoured? Does it look like she still believes in Santa? [laughs] Are her teeth still white? Behind the braces. [crowd laughs] Naturally, that night, in eighth grade, me and my girlfriends were arrestedâ€¦ [chuckles] â€¦for being too young and hot. [crowd laughs] Well, that was a body roll for anybody who forgot eighth grade. [laughs] I used to practice the body roll in the mirror before dances. Iâ€™d be likeâ€¦ [groaning] â€œYes!â€ Sometimes, Iâ€™d really kick an arm out to really get it going. [chuckling] Get out there and make some boys cream their khakis. [crowd laughs] Okay, honestly, I had no clue what I was doing, for the record. I had no clue I was making you guys tuck your boners up in your waist pants. [crowd laughs loudly] Just one lift of the shirt, I could have looked it directly in the eye, likeâ€¦ [shouts] [crowd laughing] Late apology from me. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™ll type it up in the notes app. Post it later. [sucks teeth] But it was campus police who got us. So there was a cop car ride, butâ€¦ but no cuffs. And then they took us back to the stesh very late at night and put us in a badly lit conference room, where they made us wait it out. And we were scared. [crowd laughs] And then, finally, a cop came in, and he picked up the phone book, and he slammed it down on the table, and he said, â€œCall your parents.â€ [scoffs] I was like, â€œI know the number.â€
[crowd laughs]
[laughing]
[crowd cheering]
â€œCall your parents?â€ â€œI only have a mom! Why do you think Iâ€™m down here?â€ [crowd laughs] She did pick me up. Uhâ€¦ Not very pleased with it, butâ€¦ Sheâ€¦ she said, â€œSomething bad couldâ€™ve happened to you.â€ â€œThey couldâ€™ve taken advantage of you. Iâ€™m just glad youâ€™re okay.â€ I was like, â€œIâ€™ve got no tits.â€ [crowd laughs] She said, â€œBut you have an excellent personality.â€ [crowd laughs, applauds] â€œNow get in the van!â€ [laughs] What if my mom was like, â€œNow get in the van!â€ â€œWeâ€™re driving you right back to Sigma Chi, and weâ€™re going to get you one of those frat dudes!â€ [laughs] I did drive home though, actually. Um, after the pandemonium dust settled, I drove from California to Ohio. I just wanted, like, to feel in charge instead of flying, you know? And my mom was very worried about me driving alone, cross-country. I mean, I was worried about me. I tinted my windows, I bought a knife. Butâ€¦ thereâ€™s other things to worry about besides being the hottest person at a rest stop. [crowd laughing] [laughs] For example, um, yeah, if you are traveling alone, hot tip. If someone suspect starts swiftly walking towards you, you can just say, â€œIâ€™ve actually already been raped. Thank you so much.â€ [laughs] â€œIâ€™m good. Thank you.â€ And men hate to be second, so theyâ€™re, â€œThank you for letting me know.â€ [crowd laughing] And then theyâ€™re out of there. I also went camping one of the nights, alone. I went camping in Zion National Park. It was the summer everybody was disappearing. And I was like, â€œLetâ€™s give it a whirl.â€
[crowd laughs]
Iâ€™m not even a huge camper.per. I justâ€¦ I feel like itâ€™s a good thing to do, to try, you know, at least once, alone, especially if you go into it with the perspective of, like, this is what itâ€™s like to be a woman in the world, especially at night, because you canâ€™t lock a tent flap.
If you know what I mean. [chuckles]
[crowd chuckles] [sucks teeth] If I would, I could. Uhâ€¦ So Iâ€™m in my tent. Night has fallen. I have barricaded the flap as best I can. [crowd laughs] And I heard, like, the snap of a branch, and I grew scared. And that is when I decided to be two people. And I did the voices of two people within my tent.
[crowd cheering]
[laughing] And what we discovered there isâ€¦ [laughing] â€¦when I have every opportunity in the world in front of me, my husband is so mean to me. [laughing] [sighs] I was like, â€œGoodnight, honey.â€ And he said, â€œYou go to bed!â€ [crowd laughs] â€œBut first, you suck my dick!â€ [crowd laughs] [inhales deeply, scoffs] I was like, â€œOkay.â€ â€œAt least Iâ€™m not alone right now!â€ [crowd laughing] I made the campers around me fall asleep to the sounds of me choking. [laughs] Just to keep it realistic. I did open with one bark up top. [mimics zip up] Directly into the tip. Justâ€¦ I always do it just to show it whoâ€™s boss. [crowd laughs] [laughing] Other than that, Iâ€™m not much of a risk-taker. Uhâ€¦ I donâ€™t gamble. I would never bungee jump orâ€¦ or get married. Iâ€¦ [chuckles] If I had to choose any of those risksâ€¦ [sucks teeth] â€¦Iâ€™m probably gonna bungee.
[crowd laughs]
Iâ€™m gonna bungee it. I got to figure like a grouping of synthetic fibers has to be stronger than two people making a promise. [laughing] [inhales deeply] Ehâ€¦ And plus itâ€™s, you know, itâ€™s easier to bounce back from.
Iâ€¦
[crowd laughs] [chuckles] Of all the messaging Iâ€™ve received as a gal in this world, I do feel most at peace with my decision not to wed. Sometimes itâ€™s hard to separate messaging from what you really want. And other times your body will kick in, you know. Like, I might still want kids. I just know I wonâ€™t have time to come home and let them out. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] Itâ€™s something you got to consider, uh, before you get into the kid biz. Me and my boyfriend, weâ€™re actually trying and trying and trying, but Iâ€™m on birth control. Andâ€¦ [chuckles] [crowd laughs] [inhales] â€¦it makes it difficult, uh, to conceive. Over the years, I have experimented recreationally with all different forms of birth control. And the first one I got into was, um, was the IUD. I had that for, like, eight years, and I got so much done. Andâ€¦ I remember when I got the second one inserted, the nurse asked me, she said, â€œYour uterus is tilted backwards.â€ â€œDid you know that?â€ And I remember thinking, â€œDonâ€™t know how I could.â€ [chuckles] â€œBut what youâ€™re telling me is even my uterus is likeâ€¦â€ â€œMm-mm.â€ [chuckles] [crowd laughs] â€œWeâ€™re good.â€ And then, more recently, I had to get an ultrasound, and I found out I actually have a bicornate uterus, which means my uterus is like heart-shaped, which is pretty on brand for me.
[crowd laughs]
But what it meant was, uh, the IUDâ€¦ This is, um, my impression of an IUD. [smacks lips] It was in there, bopping him on the head or whatever itâ€™s doing. [groans] [crowd laughs] Andâ€¦ some of them could have, you know, swam around and then gotten in trouble up in these parts. So, point being, that was not the right form of birth control for my body. So in my thirties, I started taking the pill, just â€™cause I wanted to know what it would be like to be a different person. [crowd laughs, applauds] And we found out. Uhâ€¦ They started me on Yaz. Has anybody here tried or tasted Yaz? [crowd laughs] You have. Are you still on it, orâ€¦?
[woman] No.
No. You got Yazzed. [crowd laughs] I would describe it as psychological warfare. Uhâ€¦ They really donâ€™t want us to be in charge. [chuckles] Like, â€œIf youâ€™re not gonna have kids to keep you at home, this will, you crazy bitch.â€
[crowd laughs]
[laughing]
[crowd applauding, cheering] Does anybody wantâ€¦ No pressure. Does anybody want to share why they stopped taking Yaz, orâ€¦? I just like to open the floor in case anybody needs to, um, get something off their chest, um, or, you know, if youâ€™re with somebody you took it for and want them to know what you went through. [crowd laughs] Depression? Rock on. [laughs] Add it to the fun list. Anybody? Again, no presh. This is for you. [crowd laughs] Iâ€™ve done all my research. Iâ€™ll go. Umâ€¦
[crowd laughs loudly]
I feel like being on that birth controlâ€¦
[woman] Multiple personalities!
Oh, and sheâ€™s a little late, that one.
[crowd laughs]
[Beth laughing] Weâ€™re glad youâ€™re both here.
[crowd laughs, applauds]
[laughing]
[crowd cheering]
[sighs] No, but I do feel like being on that birth control is the closest my boyfriend will get to a threesome. Just like, â€œme and me!â€
[crowd laughs]
[laughing] I still keep three extra months of it in my purse. Uhâ€¦ [chuckles] Just in case I need toâ€¦ lift a car.
Uhâ€¦
[crowd laughs] [chuckles] Or I meet another person that wants toâ€¦ [whispers] â€œâ€¦start a fire.â€ [crowd laughing] I did haveâ€¦ I will say we did have some fun with that birth control, because weâ€™d do some birth control bits, my boyfriend and I, you know, like rough stuff. Uhâ€¦ â€˜Cause I would take itâ€¦ I would take it before bed. Um, and so Iâ€™d be sitting across the bed from him in our matching morphsuits with the hole cut out, andâ€¦ [crowd laughs] I would say to him, â€œThank you for reminding me to take the pill.â€ He didnâ€™t, but I like to put that on him. [chuckles] And then I would take the pill, and heâ€™d make me lift up my tongue to make sure I swallowed it, likeâ€¦ [crowd laughs] And then we would do tasting notes with the birth control. Because he considers himself a bit of a sommelier, so. Heâ€™d say, â€œWhat are some of the flavor profiles youâ€™re getting from that? Iâ€™m a sommelier.â€ And Iâ€™d say, â€œUm, Iâ€™m getting, like, salty tears.â€
[crowd laughing]
â€œAnd jealousy.â€ And then heâ€™d feel bad and give me a kiss. And Iâ€™d be like, â€œUm, itâ€™s so powerful. Any residual flavor profile for you?â€ And he was likeâ€¦ [sucks teeth] â€œTotal peace and freedom.â€ [laughs] [laughing maniacally] â€œNight, night!â€ [crowd laughing] So after that, they did switch me, uh, to other birth control. [chuckling] I switched to Larin Fe which is generic for low estrogen. Not sponsored. I donâ€™t know why I got so specific. [chuckles] I wish. Can you imagine if I was sponsored by Larin Fe? [chuckles] They just reached out on Instagram. Theyâ€™re like, â€œHey, whatâ€™s up?â€ â€œWe saw you made the switch.â€ [crowd laughs] â€œCurious if you could do a quick promo bit for us.â€ Iâ€™d say, â€œSure.â€ And theyâ€™d say, â€œAction!â€ Iâ€™d just be like, â€œUmâ€¦â€ â€œItâ€™s like a little bit better. I donâ€™t know.â€
[pretends to sob]
[crowd laughs] [moans] â€œShould I read the side effects? Orâ€¦â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œPlease donâ€™t do that!â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œThatâ€™s weird, â€™cause I actuallyâ€¦ always have the side effects printed out with me at all times.â€ [crowd laughs] â€œThe, uh, side effects of Larin Fe are nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating, spotting, changes in menstrual flow, nipple discharge.â€ [laughs] â€œNot yet, but here it comes.â€
[crowd laughs]
[chuckling] â€œBreast tenderness, breast enlargement, changes in weight, rash, depression, sleep problems, weakness, tired feeling, mood changes, yeast infection.â€ I guess weâ€™re starting to see why nobody wanted to yell anything out. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Somebodyâ€™s here on a first date, and theyâ€™re like, â€œYeast infection!â€ â€œToday, tomorrow, and every night, baby!â€ [laughs] Their date is like, â€œThatâ€™s why youâ€™re shifting around in your chair.â€ [crowd laughs] I actually do have a, um, a yeast infection joke that I can never really find a home for, butâ€¦ [laughs] This does feel like a good spot for it. Andâ€¦ I did hear a chant from the back that was like, â€œTell it. Tell it. Tellâ€¦â€ [inhales deeply] Thank you. So the yeast infection joke goes like this. I wonâ€™t know that youâ€™re cheating on me, but my hoot will, because it turns into, like, an old southern chef thatâ€™s like, â€œI knew you were having guests, so I baked something.â€ [crowd laughing] [inhales] [crowd applauding] [crowd cheering] [Beth laughs, sighs] [sucks teeth] â€œSwelling.
[crowd laughs]
Freckles or dark patches of skin on the face.â€ The â€œorâ€ is troubling. Uhâ€¦ [chuckles] One of those is way worse. [crowd laughs] Can you imagine starting at the same time as your friend? You guys get together for lunch. Youâ€™re like, â€œWhatâ€™d you get, freckles or dark patches?â€ [chuckles] â€œOh man, I got dark patches.â€ [laughing] The last oneâ€™s migraine. Larin Fe is likeâ€¦ [chuckles] The birth control company is like, â€œCould you put a spin on that or something?â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œAll I heard was breast enlargement!â€ [mimics horn blaring] [laughing] [sighs] I didnâ€™t have boobs for the longest time. Aforementioned, I was a gymnast. Side packs for ages. I was ripped as a child. And when you donâ€™t have boobs as a kid, you really want â€™em because weâ€™re taught that theyâ€™re our worth, andâ€¦ I do remember, um, wearing a padded swimsuit at theâ€¦ at the pool. The trouble with that is when you get out of the pool, thereâ€™s, like, just two waterfalls dripping underneath. [laughs] The good thing was I was strong enough that I was able to pull myself out of the pool and, at the same time, squeegee my tits out, and then head to the snack bar, get a frozen Snickers, whatever you want to break a tooth on. [chuckles]
[crowd laughs]
But by the time junior high came, I couldnâ€™t just show up empty-chested. How was I going to get a dude back to my momâ€™s unfurnished basement? [chuckling] So I had to act fast. I went up to my momâ€™s room. I stole her water bra, which Victoriaâ€™s Secret stole from a hose and water balloons. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] And then just charged us fifty bucks, and we were like, â€œHonestly, weâ€™ll do anything.â€ So I strapped on the water bra, I marched to junior high, and it worked. I snagged a teen. I was also a teen at the time, just to be clear. [crowd laughs] I got him back to my momâ€™s unfurnished basement, popped in the Billy Elliot VHS, which was my fuck tape.
Iâ€¦
[crowd laughs] [laughs] I still donâ€™t know how that movie ends. And the water bra made me inadvertently celibate. â€˜Cause I wanted to be touched, but I couldnâ€™t let him touch or put any sort of, like, weight upon it, because it made a strange likeâ€¦ [mimics water creaking] â€¦sound that I could not explain. And I also couldnâ€™t do a sneaky release underneath my shirt and chuck it far away, â€™cause it was like the weight of an X-ray vest. [crowd laughing] It was like, â€œFuck.â€ [chuckles] And after that, I would have had no choice but to be likeâ€¦ [gasps] â€œTa-da!â€ [chuckles] â€œI made my boobs disappear!â€
[crowd laughs]
â€œAnd now, for my assistant, my mom taking the towels out of the dryer.â€ [crowd laughs] And magic is not hot, you know, it never will be. Itâ€™s a trick. A guy wants boobs, and he gets water. Not cool. [crowd chuckles] I feel like the only time that would work is if theâ€¦ if it was like reversed or something. Like, you were running a marathon, and I was volunteering on the side with the water. And you came up for the water, and I was like, [whispers] â€œOr you can touch my tits.â€ [crowd laughs] Like, â€œOh my God. Thank you so much. I know thereâ€™s water up here.â€ â€œI donâ€™t know when thereâ€™s gonna be tits again. Thank you.â€ [laughs] That was the longest Iâ€™ve run in a while. Umâ€¦ [crowd laughs] [chuckles] The last time I went running was through the airport, and it tasted like coins in the back of my mouth. [chuckling] Just a little bullet back there. I didnâ€™t grow my boobs until college, and it was with ice cream. [chuckles]
[crowd laughs]
And since then Iâ€™ve gained and lost weight so many times over the years, my boobs are like an atheist dad at Catholic mass whoâ€™s just like, â€œIâ€™m not going to get up again.â€ [chuckles] â€œThis is insane!â€ [crowd laughing] [sucks teeth] Okay. Huâ€¦ huge news. [laughs] Okay, itâ€™s not that big news. No, huge news. I got a king-sized bed. Thank you so much. Thank you. [crowd cheering] Things are going well. Yeah. I got a king-sized bed, and I started hooking up with this 6-foot-6 football player dude. And Iâ€™m just likeâ€¦ [laughs] â€¦if you build itâ€¦ [chuckles] [crowd laughs] â€¦they will come. At the time, I was hooking up with a smaller gentleman. And I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever done the back and forth between sizes of people, but it can feel drastic. Uhâ€¦ Itâ€™s sort of like when you go to the fridge for a jug of juice that you think is full, but itâ€™s empty, and youâ€™re like, â€œWhoa!â€
[crowd laughs loudly]
[laughs] Itâ€™s the only way I can describe that. I was pregnant once, but I caught it early. And I went over to Planned Parenthood and got someâ€¦ some Mife and Miso andâ€¦ and what I call â€œjump-started a late period.â€ And then I went and did a table read and a taping for Comedy Central. So we really can have it all. [crowd laughs] And, you know, if youâ€™re feeling like, um, you donâ€™t align with this story or my beliefs, donâ€™t worry. There is somebody in the story, that, um, shares yours. Itâ€™s a leprechaun in Orlando. Umâ€¦ [crowd laughing] [applauding, cheering] My dadâ€¦ [chuckles] My dad hates Planned Parenthood. [chuckles] He thinks all I do is kill babies because I got the one abortion there. [sucks teeth] You guys, Iâ€™m kidding. [chuckles] I havenâ€™t told him yet, butâ€¦ [crowd laughs] I always tell him if abortion were murder, thereâ€™d be a Law & Order: SVU about it. [chuckles] And that he understands. [crowd laughs] But I do like to donate to them in his name andâ€¦ [crowd laughs] â€˜Cause they do other stuff. Thereâ€™s all kinds of people in there, um, looking for a good deal on an ultrasound. Um, getting those free condoms that are so thick. Uhâ€¦ [laughs] Why are the free condoms so thick? Itâ€™s almost like theyâ€™re trying to drum up business. [chuckles]
[crowd laughs]
Iâ€¦ Thereâ€™s people in there getting their penises checked and also their balls. I donâ€™t want to alienate anybody here with balls. Iâ€¦ I never do. I love balls. [chuckles] I genuinely love balls. I could actually get emotional thinking about it. Iâ€¦ I love balls. I feel like theyâ€™re the closest Iâ€™ll come to a deep-sea creature. Theyâ€™re justâ€¦ [crowd laughs] â€¦theyâ€™re so amorphous and malleable. [laughs] And then sometimes they shell up, you know. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] [Beth sighs] So I did this fundraiser. [crowd laughing] This fundraiser for Planned Parenthood. Itâ€™s this yearly event called the Birds and Bees Bash. That happens in Santa Barbara, California, where a bunch of rich old people gather together and throw money at the cause. Itâ€™s a beautiful thing. So they invited me to come do 15 minutes of stand-up, and I show up. Itâ€™s a swanky event, so Iâ€™ve slapped on a skirt, which is obviously a big deal for me. And they sit me down in the back of this beautiful banquet hall, next to Joanna Kerns. If you donâ€™t know who that is, itâ€™s Mrs. Seaver from Growing Pains. And if you donâ€™t know who that isâ€¦ [chuckles] â€¦I donâ€™t care. I was so excited. [crowd laughs] I sat down, and I was like, â€œMom.â€
[crowd laughs]
So she explains sheâ€™s going to give the keynote speech, and then sheâ€™ll bring me up to do stand-up. I was like, â€œGreat.â€ So Joannaâ€™s up there talking about Planned Parenthood and how they helped her and her family, uh, with breast exams, and a woman at the back of the room, at the table next to us, starts to have a heart attack. And Joanna just keeps talking â€™cause she doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on in the back of the room. Just like I canâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on in every room Iâ€™m in. People could be up in the balcony making sweet love, and weâ€™d have no clue, especially if it was, like, super slow, like I like. [crowd laughs] So Joannaâ€™s up here, talking, this woman is having a heart attack. Iâ€™m watching her have a heart attack, and Iâ€™m also thinking, like, â€œWhat jokes am I going to tell?â€ You know. [crowd chuckles] And then an ambulance comes very quickly, almost as if they knew there was a gathering of olds, and they just parked on the corner. [crowd laughs] So they rush in. They put this woman on the stretcher. Because it was a heart attack. It was a low-key heart attack. She fell out of her chair, and her husband was worried. But as they were wheeling her out on the stretcher, past our table, towards the door, she looked at us, and she said, â€œIâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m fine.â€ â€œIâ€™m so sorry.â€ [crowd laughs] Which might be the epitome of being a woman. Like, â€œIâ€™m sorry I interrupted with a heart attack.â€ â€œIâ€™m happy to die if that helps. I really will. Iâ€™ll go die.â€
[crowd chuckles]
So just as they have her outside the door, this is when Joanna leans into the mic, and she said, â€œWhoâ€™s ready for some stand-up comedy?â€ [crowd laughing] And I was like, â€œOh no.â€ So I get up, and Iâ€™m like weaving my way through the tables in my dumb skirt. And the woman whoâ€™s planned the event is panicked. And she rushes, she intercepts me, she puts her hand on my shoulder, and sheâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ â€œMaybe you should do less time, like 5 minutes or something?â€ I was like, â€œBitch, Iâ€™m doing 15.â€ [crowd laughing loudly] So I got up there, and I felt like I really needed to address the situation, because I hadnâ€™t learned this lesson yet. [crowd laughs] And I got up there in front of everybody, and I just said, â€œWow.â€ â€œI have done a lot of things to get out of donating money, but never that!â€
[chuckles]
[crowd laughs, applauds] [crowd cheering] [chuckles] There were less laughs. Uhâ€¦ [crowd laughs] [chuckles] itâ€™s taken me a few years to be able to talk about that. [crowd laughs] But I do feel like my dad would be proud of me. I bombed the Planned Parenthood. [chuckles] [laughs, sighs] Can a mammal from the weasel family do that? [crowd laughs] Feels like Iâ€™m making the Christmas card this year. [crowd laughs] [crowd cheering] Thank you very, very much for being here for me.
[rock music plays]
I love you. [mouthing] Thank you. [crowd cheering, applauding]
[rock music continues]
[rock music ends]
Okay, whereâ€™s Tim? [crowd laughs] Tim is here, but he actuallyâ€¦ I donâ€™t want to ruin it for you guys. He did babysit for me, but that other part was a joke. [crowd laughing] Aw. Are you guys disappointed heâ€™s a good guy, orâ€¦? [laughs] [crowd laughs] Kara and I worked at, um, Graeterâ€™s together. First job. [crowd cheers] I invented the chocolate weasel, so if you ever enjoyed that, youâ€™re welcome.
[crowd laughs]
[woman] Timâ€™s up here!
Love you, Tim.
[crowd laughing]
Oh, Tim would be in the balconyâ€¦ to get a better view. [crowd cheers] Iâ€™m kidding. Iâ€™m sorry. My momâ€™s here. There she is. Give it up for Diane here.
[crowd cheers]
The Schaeffer family. My second family here in town. Schaeffers, Beth and Alan. Amy may or may not have been there that night that we went to UD.
[crowd laughs]
[Beth] You knew it. You had to come pick us up. Alanâ€™s like, â€œCan I not be a lawyer for one night?!â€

[cheers and applause rise and fade out]
Iâ€™ve been able to have a very interesting perspective on whatâ€™s happening in America recently because I havenâ€™t been living here. Um, Iâ€™ve actually been living in Barcelona, which is a very lovely place. Um, itâ€™s a beach city. But itâ€™s also a bit of a gay city. I think thatâ€™s why they have the lisp. Uhâ€¦ â€œBarthelona.â€ [chuckles] Itâ€™s like, â€œWe get it. You have something in your mouth.â€ Because itâ€™s a beach city, and itâ€™s a European beach city, a lot of the beaches there are clothing-optional. Which means you end up seeing a lot of penises. Um, and itâ€™s never the best penises, you know? First of all, women never want to see a penis that they donâ€™t want to see. Even the one we do want to see, a lot of times weâ€™re like, â€œCan you put that away or, like, in something?â€ â€œOkay. In me? All right. Fine. â€˜Causeâ€¦â€ â€œAs long as the capâ€™s back on the pen, you know?â€ Having a penis out at the beach, itâ€™s definitely not a young manâ€™s game. This is an old manâ€™s game. â€˜Cause the unwritten rule is that you can have your penis out, but, like, it has to stay floppy. You know, and I imagine thatâ€™s just harder for younger guys â€™cause thereâ€™s, like, boobs and, like, you know, a breeze. But these older guys are quite impressive. Theyâ€™re there with their hands on their hips, â€œMy penis will stay as soft as the sand Iâ€™m standing on.â€ A lot of them are bigger guys too. Theyâ€™re a bit older, out-of-shape guys. Theyâ€™ve got a bit of a belly. I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ve seen their penis in a while. I think thatâ€™s kind of why they do it, you know, so they can see it reflected in your eyes. Like, â€œI still got it. Okay, good.â€ Of course, thereâ€™s women there, too, so thereâ€™s a lot of boobs out. Anytime I go to the beach, I donâ€™t take off my swimsuit because Iâ€™m not trying to get that sunburned. And, uhâ€¦ But Iâ€™ll go with my friend, and she takes off her top andâ€¦ She recentlyâ€¦ She got breast implants, soâ€¦ and I hadnâ€™t seen them yet, and they were, like, reallyâ€¦ they look really good. So I was like, â€œOh my gosh, your fake boobs look amazing.â€ And then she got mad at me â€™cause I called them fake boobs. And I was like, â€œWell, theyâ€™re not real.â€ If your friend got breast implants, would you call them real?
[audience members] No.
Would you? Okay, good. So weâ€™re all a little transphobic.
[audience laughs, then exclaims]
Thatâ€™s a fun social experiment. You know, if theyâ€™re fake on a womanâ€¦ theyâ€™re fake on a woman. Anyway, what Iâ€¦ [chuckles] I know, you all feel like I got you, didnâ€™t you? Well, I did. Thatâ€™s why. What Iâ€™m talking about right now, though, isâ€¦ Iâ€™m describing the regular beach. So in Barcelona, thereâ€™s a regular beach, and thereâ€™s a gay beach. If youâ€™re one of those people like, â€œWhy canâ€™t the gay beach be the regular beach?â€ Go to the gay beach. Youâ€™ll be like, â€œThatâ€™s not regular.â€ And, of course, thereâ€™s also penises out at the gay beach, but the differences between the penises at the regular beach and the penises at the gay beach are like the difference between a dog parkand a dog show. Like, at the regular beach, theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™re all just having a good time!â€ At the gay beach, theyâ€™re like, â€œNumber five,â€ and heâ€™s like, â€œYes, yes.â€ Of course, you know when I say â€œgay beachâ€ I mean male gay beach. Itâ€™s not a lesbian beach. I wanna go to a lesbian beach. I wanna go to a beach where theyâ€™re like, â€œVolleyballâ€™s at 5:00. Sunscreenâ€™s over there.â€ â€œHereâ€™s some boots. The sandâ€™s uneven, weâ€™re working on it.â€ â€œWe teach CPR on Mondays.â€ â€œWe do have Taco Tuesdays. It does mean both things.â€ â€œYou can eat, and then you can eat.â€ Okay, okay, soâ€¦ if the regular beach is a dog park, and the gay beach is a dog show, the lesbian beach is a dog rescue. Itâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re safe here.â€ And also, they probably literally rescue dogs. I have developed, over the last couple years, a fascination with lesbians. Are there any lesbians here?
[scattered whooping]
How many gay men are here?
[louder scattered whooping]
Itâ€™s probably about the same number, but this is why I like lesbians. Gay men, youâ€™re very loud.
[scattered clapping]
Lesbians live in the shadows. Gay menâ€¦ We always know when gay men are around. You guys arenâ€™t shy at all. Even at the parade, you guys are like above the float, dancing all around. Lesbians are just underneath, making sure stuff works. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™re on the right route. Itâ€™s okay, yeah.â€ Lesbians live in the shadows. You know, lesbians are like bees. If you donâ€™t bother them, they wonâ€™t bother you. But also, if they all die, the world ends.
[scattered clapping]
And you doâ€¦ Like, lesbians doâ€¦ You scare me a little bit. Iâ€™m intimidated by lesbians. Uh, youâ€™re a bit scary. Uh, I think lesbians are so scary that even AIDS was like, â€œLetâ€™s stick to less terrifying things like needles and butt holes.â€ [chuckles] And lesbians definitely leave their mark on the world. Itâ€™s just sometimes a little more subtle. Like, lesbians wore khakis so hard that now when men wear khakis, they look like lesbians. Like, any time I see Jim Harbaugh on the sideline, Iâ€™m like, â€œGo get â€™em, Coach Lesbian.â€ Like, any of you gay men who are here, were any of you, like, little gay boys?
[distant whooping]
Yeah. Youâ€¦ You know the gay boys Iâ€™m talking about. Weâ€™ve all seen the little gay boys. Like, the kids at the park that are just like, â€œI donâ€™t want to play.â€ Heâ€™s, like, over twerking by the slide. His dadâ€™s trying to throw the ball with him and itâ€™s like, â€œJust stop it.â€ â€œItâ€™s not going to catch, okay?â€ We know little gay boys exist, which means little lesbians also exist, but you never see a little lesbian because lesbians live in the shadows. I want to see a little lesbian, you know, just a little girl, like, aggressively eating a muffin. She doesnâ€™t know why sheâ€™s doing it. Sheâ€™s like, â€œI got to practice.â€ â€œI got to really get in there.â€ And I think women, we really fucked up. We befriended gay men. I donâ€™t think that was the right choice. I think we shouldâ€™ve befriended lesbians. Lesbians would be like, â€œCome on, we found a way to run a successful society.â€ Instead, we befriended gay men, and theyâ€™re like, â€œBitch, youâ€™re ugly.â€
[audience applauds]
And weâ€™re like, â€œHeâ€™s my best friend.â€ â€œI like him â€™cause heâ€™s mean to me in a different way.â€ And thereâ€™s not, likeâ€¦ not that many prominent lesbians, you know? Even now, sometimes youâ€™ll hear about lesbiansâ€¦ Like, youâ€™ll find out theyâ€™re a lesbian after they died. Like, men will be like, â€œOh, I thought she was just miserable and alone.â€ And itâ€™s like, â€œNo, she lived with that lady.â€ â€œYeah, I know, I thought they were miserable and alone together.â€ â€˜Cause I think itâ€™s still hard for straight men to sometimes believe that women can be happy without a man. And I think even straight women, I think even we know that thatâ€™s possible. And now we have the luxury to decide if we want to get married or not. That used to not be the case. You used to always have to get married. Iâ€™m sure there were some women that, like, during World War II, their husband went off to fight in the war, and then he died. And they were like, â€œOh no.â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™m too heartbroken, I can never marry again.â€ â€œThis bed is big.â€ [chuckles] And also, for the longest time, I think straight men, they always wanted lesbians to be, like, two hot young women who would maybe, like, invite them to join. And lesbians were like, â€œNo, thatâ€™s not who weâ€™re gonna be.â€ There was always at least one lesbian in a couple who looked like she knew how to, like, build a deck. And that made sense to me. That couple made sense to me because I knew who was doing the work. Now there is the emergence of the young, hot lesbian couple, and it doesnâ€™t make any sense to me, because I have no idea whoâ€™s doing any work. Hot women donâ€™t have to work. I canâ€™t figure it out. It just seems like itâ€™s going to be two women lying in bed waiting for something to happen to them. Like, when thereâ€™s a burglar, whoâ€™s going down? And also, whoâ€™s going down? I know the answer for gay men. Itâ€™s both of you for both those things. Youâ€™re both going down on each other, and youâ€™re both going down to the burglar to see if he wants to come up. Like, â€œOh, you brought zip ties? Good. We were already playing hostage.â€ But my biggestâ€¦ The reason Iâ€™ve been so fascinated with lesbians, I think it actually comes from a jealousy. Iâ€™m jealous of the lesbian relationship because you get to be a wife, but you also get a wife. That seems super productive. I want to be a wife, but I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t get a wife. I get a husband. And whatâ€™s he going to do? Whatâ€™s he gonna do in this almost equal society we fought so hard for? What? Protect me? From who? Heâ€™s the guy most likely to kill me.
[scattered clapping]
[distant whooping]
And so the fact is, you know, the reason I moved to Barcelona, as a strong independent woman, was for a boy. [chuckles] And being in love and being happy is the worst thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me. Uhâ€¦ I wasâ€¦ Before this, I was always single and I was miserable, and it made sense, and I knew why. Now Iâ€™m happy, and Iâ€™m in love, and itâ€™s terrifying because it could go away at any point. But I actually think this is the key to a successful relationship. Never feel secure. [chuckles] No matter how long youâ€™ve been in a relationship, always think your partner could leave. â€˜Cause then youâ€™re never too mean. Like, I treat my guy like an indoor/outdoor cat. Iâ€™m like, â€œYou can go, but thereâ€™s good food here.â€
[scattered clapping]
And Iâ€™ve been learning a lot of terrible things about myself in this relationship. Like, um, Iâ€¦ I learned that, apparently, Iâ€™m a nurturer. Like, uh, despite any of my wishes. Uhâ€¦ I like to do things for him, like cook for him and do his laundry. Which is insane, because I donâ€™t like to do my own laundry. This is everything you need to know about why women arenâ€™t ahead. Weâ€™re just willing to do nice stuff for other people because it makes us feel good. I didnâ€™t want this to be my life. I didnâ€™t know cooking and doing laundry for a man would do something like bring me joy. But it does. I love to do it. I love to take care of him. Itâ€™s really lovely. I started using fabric softener because of him. I never used fabric softener before because I thought fabric softener was a scheme. I thought it was a scheme by Big Laundry to just get us to use another liquid. And so Iâ€™ve never used it before. And one day he comes up to meâ€¦ And he approached me about this like anyone does who, like, wants something to keep happening, you know. He was like, â€œHey, baby, I love you so much.â€ â€œDo you ever notice our clothes are a little bit crunchy?â€ [chuckles] And when I hear crunchy clothes, the first thing I think of is semen, right? But I know thatâ€™s not why these clothes are crunchy, â€™cause I know where all the semen is going, you know? Guys, donâ€™t be gross. In the trash can. Which is what I call my vagina.
[man shouts]
[scattered clapping]
This is aâ€¦ This is just a tiny peek into a comedianâ€™s life. I riffed that joke on stage one night, and I liked it so much that I was like, Iâ€™d rather keep calling my vagina a trash can than not do that joke. So the clothes are crunchy and itâ€™s not â€™cause of the semen, because thatâ€™s in old trash can over here. Heâ€™s like, â€œEver notice our clothes are crunchy?â€ I was like, â€œYeah, I have noticed.â€ And he was like, â€œMaybe we could start using fabric softener.â€ And then I went on my whole â€œfabric softener is a schemeâ€ rant, and he didnâ€™t leave, you know, so I thought that was pretty good. And so I bought fabric softener, and I started using it. And you know what happens when you put fabric softener onto the clothes that you then put on your body? It makes them softer. Itâ€™s a perfectly-named product. I shouldâ€™ve been using it this whole time. Know what I blame? I blame the marketing. Theyâ€™re marketing this product wrong. You got to get rid of that gay Snuggie Bear. Heâ€™s gay, right? Him and the Pillsbury Doughboy, theyâ€™re gay. Theyâ€™reâ€¦ Theyâ€™re just out there touching tummies. You know what fabric softener needs? Know what mascot fabric softener needs? A sturdy lesbian. Just a sturdy lesbian on the cover being like, â€œIt works, okay?â€ And Iâ€™m not used to a lot of the stuff that comes with relationships. He says very romantic and sweet things to me, you know. Like, heâ€™ll say things like, â€œI could just look into your eyes forever.â€ â€œYou have the most beautiful eyes.â€ Which, to be honest, made me feel okay about my body, you know? Like, â€œJust my eyes? Okay.â€ Uhâ€¦ Then I do the very girly thing that we sometimes do. Iâ€™d be like, â€œWell, what happens when I get old and, uhâ€¦â€ â€œLike, myâ€¦â€ I hopefully age terribly, you know, andâ€¦ â€œâ€¦you know, everything starts falling apart?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t care. I could look into your eyes forever.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re so beautiful. I absolutely love staring into your eyes.â€ Which is like a really sweet thing to say. But then I thought of one more question I wanted to ask him. But I didnâ€™t ask it because thereâ€™s only one right answer, and I knew if he didnâ€™t say the right answer, Iâ€™d have to leave. The question I wanted to ask was, â€œOkay, so what if someone plucked out my eyesâ€¦ and I just had two sockets?â€ â€œThen what would you do?â€ I didnâ€™t ask that question â€™cause thereâ€™s only one right answer. And the right answer is, â€œWalk away quietly.â€
[scattered clapping]
â€˜Cause thatâ€™s the funniest way to leave a newly blind person, isâ€¦ â€œAre you still there?â€ â€œI feel your energy.â€ And it is, you know, likeâ€¦ Oh, I should mention, the guy Iâ€™m in a relationship with, heâ€™s a Black man, and the only reason Iâ€™m telling you that is so you know Iâ€™m a good person. Uhâ€¦ Itâ€™s really relevant for the next couple jokes. They donâ€™t work as well if heâ€™s not Black. Uhâ€¦ There was one night I got home, and he was asleep on the couch, and the TV was on. And I donâ€™t know what he fell asleep to, but when I came in, there was a video playing about white privilege. I was like, â€œThis is the most passive-aggressive thing Iâ€™ve ever seen.â€ Like, Iâ€™m the white woman in this relationship. Iâ€™m the passive-aggressive one. How are you supposed toâ€¦ How dare you try to out-white-woman me? So I did the whitest-woman thing I could think of. I called the police. And now heâ€™s dead, soâ€¦ Iâ€™m kidding, we live in Spain. They donâ€™t do that there. They just give you an olive and make you take a nap. But, you know, itâ€™s been really great andâ€¦ Actually, not just this relationship, but everything over the past couple years, itâ€™s really taught me we should always lead with love and kindness. No matter what. The relationship youâ€™re in, your friends, your family, strangers, especially strangers. We should always lead with love and kindness. And of course weâ€™re gonna argue, of course weâ€™re gonna disagree. And hopefully those arguments never get too bad, but no matter what happens, you should always try to be the first person. Always try to be the first person to say, â€œWhy are you yelling?â€ â€˜Cause if you say that, youâ€™ve won. And thatâ€™s what itâ€™s really all about.

Part 2: All Struggles Matter + Me Too
[Michelle] Hi, guys, how are you?
[upbeat music playing]
[audience cheering and clapping]
Itâ€™s fine, I donâ€™t really care.
[laughter]
I always like being here in Philadelphia.
[audience exclaims]
I love being here in Denver. You guys, you know you have a good town.
[audience cheering]
[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.
[audience exclaims]
I love coming to Madison. I love being back here.
[audience laughs]
This is gonna be fun. Weâ€™re gonna have a good time.
[cheers and applause rise and fade out]
Iâ€™ve been noticing lately that a lot of comedians have been using their time on stage to talk about their struggles, and how they identify. And I think thatâ€™s good for comedy.
[audience laughs]
Umâ€¦ Guys, this is serious. Soâ€¦ [chuckles] Guys, Iâ€™m about to talk about my struggles. I thought, you know, I could use my platform, here, to talk about how I struggle and how I identify. You remember, like, 15 years ago, this commercial would come on that would be like, â€œDo you have the urge to move your legs at night?â€ â€œDo you get a creepy crawly feeling in your legs?â€ â€œYou might have restless leg syndrome.â€ Well, it turns out, I have restless leg syndrome. And you know how I got diagnosed with restless leg syndrome? I listened to those symptoms, and then I go, â€œYes, I have it.â€ Thereâ€™s no cure. And it is. You get this, like, itchy kind of feeling in your legs at night. You feel like you have to move them. Which also, I meanâ€¦ Even just to have this diseaseâ€¦ Calling it a disease is a bit of aâ€¦ stretch. Itâ€™s kind of like the white women of diseases. You know, where youâ€™re like, â€œIs it a problem? I donâ€™tâ€¦â€ Like, even to recognize that you have it, you have to have a lot of time to rest. I was just relaxing at home for hoursâ€¦ when my legs were like, â€œMove.â€ Itâ€™s either restless legs, or itâ€™s, like, prediabetes. Likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s your body being like, â€œTake a lap.â€ [chuckles] And itâ€™s hard. The more you talk about it, kind of like the more, like, unbelievable it actually sounds. Like, if there was a GoFundMe for restless leg syndrome and a cat who needed a wheelchairâ€¦ I think that catâ€™s getting a wheelchair. We donâ€™t even know if he has restless legs â€™cause he doesnâ€™t have any.
[audience exclaims]
Oh, donâ€™t be sad about a fake cat that I just made up. And, like, this is not a great thing to complain about in the best of times, but, like, weâ€™re not in the best of times. You know? Like, weâ€™re just out of pandemic. People canâ€™t find baby formula, gas is like $90 an ounce. Meanwhile, Iâ€™m like, â€œSometimes at night I have to wiggle my legs because of the itchys and the scratchys.â€ So, I guess what Iâ€™d like to do tonight is Iâ€™d like to come out as insufferable. [chuckling]
[woman cheers]
[man] Yeah!
I feel validated because this Black man just raised his glass to me. And weunderstand suffering. It hasâ€¦ It hasâ€¦ It has been a really hard time for white women. I mean, not literally. [chuckles] Like, a lot of people are coming out and talking about their struggles, and white women are really trying to be a part of that. Itâ€™s been kind of hard for us to do, you know? â€˜Cause itâ€™s hard to have, like, a struggle and a skin care routine. Like, things are hard. I did this joke the other night and a white lady screamed out. She goes, â€œYouâ€™re going the wrong way.â€ Sheâ€™s really having a hard time. But I thought about it and I think, white women, I think I figured out what our struggle is. I think our struggle is hearing how hard it is for other people is really hard for us. Likeâ€¦ Like, we heard how hard it was for Black people, and we were devastated. We saw pictures of the destruction in Ukraine, and we needed a social media break. We heard about the crimes against humanity in Palestine, and we didnâ€™t really get into that one â€™cause thatâ€™s not one of the â€œinâ€ crises. But in general, hearing how hard things are for other people has been really hard for us. So hard, we can barely make our own jewelry. [chuckles] And, like, we blame a lot of stuff on white men, you know, and women, you have done a lot of stuff. [chuckles] Like, donâ€™t even get mad about it. Youâ€™ve been really terrible, but youâ€™re really good at it. You know? Like, white men came over from Europe, annihilated a civilization, and then rebranded it as Thanksgiving. Thatâ€™s, like, pretty impressive. You know, and we blame a lot of stuff on you guys, which is very funny to me because we act like we havenâ€™t participated in it at all. And we have participated at the most fundamental of levels. We made you. [chuckles] Weâ€™re like the guy who made the atom bomb, and weâ€™re like, â€œBut donâ€™t use it!â€ Youâ€™d think, weâ€™ve spent all this time with white men, you would think we would have picked up some tips and tricks by now. You know. You guys have the blueprint. Itâ€™s like we havenâ€™t learned anything. Itâ€™s like we spent our whole life with Michael Jordan and only walked away with a bad gambling habit. I think one of the reasons itâ€™s been hard for us to get ahead is because white women, we want toâ€¦ We donâ€™t want to give up being the victim, you know? But we also want to be in charge. We want to be the head victim in charge. You know, we want to be the manager, but we also want to be able to ask for the manager. Like, â€œI need to speak to the manager!â€ â€œOh no, thatâ€™s me, and Iâ€™m a bitch.â€ And weâ€™re really good at being the victim, you know, weâ€™re good at it. Like, weâ€™re the bride of victims. No matter whatâ€™s happening to other people, weâ€™re like, â€œNo, no, itâ€™s my day.â€ [chuckles] â€œAnd my dadâ€™s kind of paying for the whole thing, soâ€¦â€ And sometimes I get a bit frustrated with white women becauseâ€¦ By the way, this whole section is gonna be about you, white women, if you havenâ€™t picked that up yet. So if youâ€™re starting, you know, starting to take offense, donâ€™t worry, just cross your arms. â€œThis is not what I came here for.â€ Sometimes I feel like weâ€™re waiting for things to be nice for us, you know? Because Iâ€™ve said it before, you know. White women, we are oppressed. Sexism definitely exists, you know. But white men, you guys were smart. You kept us comfortable. It was a very air-conditioned oppression. Like, you know, again, I donâ€™t want to downplay what happens to women. You know. Like, obviously sexism exists. A lot of women get murdered and assaulted, um, by like, you knowâ€¦ Okay. So I looked up the statistics for this. Umâ€¦ For the joke, not because I cared. [chuckles] But, of the women who get murdered, 91% of them get murdered by someone they know. 62% of that is by their husband. So not are we getting murdered, weâ€™re getting murdered by the people who we love the most. You know, and then I heard about all these trans women getting murdered and assaulted. And all I could think of when I heard that was, â€œWelcome.â€ [chuckles lightly]
[audience chuckles, then exclaims]
â€œJump on in, the water is terrible.â€ â€œAnd full of missing women.â€
[scattered whooping and clapping]
Some people will say, â€œNo, statistically, more trans women are getting murdered.â€ Iâ€™m like, are they getting murdered â€™cause theyâ€™re trans or are they getting murdered â€™cause theyâ€™re not used to presenting as a woman? You know, like, I can understand if theyâ€™re getting murdered, someoneâ€™s murdering them, theyâ€™re like, â€œThis is â€™cause youâ€™re trans.â€ [chuckling] By the wayâ€¦ Sorry, Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m stabbing the person. I just looked at myself doing that. I was like, it looks likeâ€¦ Okay, Iâ€™m not jerking the person off. Itâ€™s a very different situation. â€œThis is â€™cause youâ€™re trans.â€ â€œItâ€™s a fun surprise.â€ You knowâ€¦ Technically, maybe you could murder someone that way, I donâ€™t know. Probably take a while. [chuckles dryly] â€œYouâ€™re almost out.â€ You know what Iâ€™m saying? Iâ€¦ No, this is a knife, and Iâ€™m stabbing. â€œThisâ€¦ This is â€™cause youâ€™re trans.â€ If thatâ€™s how theyâ€™re getting murdered, okay, yes. Itâ€™s because theyâ€™re trans. Or, you know, is it because theyâ€™re not used to presenting as women and theyâ€™re doing, you know, stuff they shouldnâ€™t be doing, likeâ€¦ walking home at night. Like, you used to be a lion. Now youâ€™re a gazelle. Thereâ€™s different rules, bitch. Okay? You canâ€™t do everything you used to be able to do. You canâ€™t just hang around vans. Like, whatâ€¦ what happened? Did you speak up in a meeting? Or did you do the most dangerous thing of all? Did you marry the love of your life? So, I understand. I understand when women are unhappy with society. You know, it makes sense to me. But youâ€™re unhappy with society, do something about it. You know, all I see is these white women Karening. And thatâ€™s really frustrating to me. First of all, Karening isnâ€™t new. Kareningâ€™s been happening since the beginning of time. You guys just finally started recording it. Like, thereâ€™s literally, like, cave paintings of Karens. Itâ€™s just a woman whoâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re not supposed to have a fire here.â€ Karening frustrates me â€™cause itâ€™s such an ineffective use of your power. You know, like when white men are unhappy with society, they really do something about it. They really get in there. You know, they run for office, they change laws, they gerrymander, they get their hands dirty, you know? When weâ€™re unhappy with society, we donâ€™t do that. We just, like, knock over a display in Target. Itâ€™s so frustrating. I think sometimes we think that, like, you know, as individuals, we canâ€™t create change. And you can. Just you, as an individual, you can create change. I see men do it all the time. Women, you can do it on your own. You know, like, umâ€¦ Ted Kaczynski wasnâ€™t happy with society, and you know what he did? He built a perfectly symmetrical cabin, he wrote a manifesto, and sure, he sent some bombs in the mail, which wasnâ€™t a great idea. But you know what happened to him? Netflix made three documentariesâ€¦ and everyone knows Ted Kaczynski is the Unabomber. I donâ€™t even know a Karenâ€™s real name. Yâ€™all are just thrown under the umbrella of Karen. I want a white woman to do something where I know your full name. Be your own Ted Kaczynski.
[scattered whooping and clapping]
[chuckles] And look, you know, like, I donâ€™t always just like to present problems, you know? Sometimes itâ€™s good to have solutions too. And so I think women, white women, I think at some point in your life, you should be in a serious relationship with a Black man. All of us white women, at some point in our life, a serious relationship with a Black man. Justâ€¦ Yeah. Umâ€¦ Maybe this guy. Uhâ€¦ Heâ€™s sitting by himself. [chuckles] I need you to be in a serious relationship with a Black man, just so you can hear how stupid all of your complaints actually sound. Like if you both get home from a hard day and youâ€™re like, â€œI literally had the worst day.â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, I had a bad day too.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œWell, what happened to you?â€ â€œWell, another Black man was shot in the back by the police, and it was actually a guy from my neighborhood and he wasnâ€™t even running away.â€ â€œHe was walking away, and this stuff just keeps happening, and itâ€™s never going to change, and Iâ€™ve lost, like, all hope, and Iâ€™m just so angry.â€ â€œBut what happened to you?â€ [softly] Uhâ€¦ -Ehâ€¦ â€“
[audience laughs]
â€œNo, itâ€™s not important.â€ â€œNo, baby, in this house, we share.â€ â€œWhat happens to you happens to me.â€ Umâ€¦ â€œWell, today at work, this guy called me a girl, and Iâ€™m a woman.â€ I can feel some women in here be like, â€œWell, she is.â€
[upbeat music playing]
[Michelle] I make fun of white women a lot. And the only reason I do it is because itâ€™s fun and easy. But itâ€™s not fair. You also deserve credit for some stuff, too, you know? Like, remember a couple of summers ago when we realized that Black Lives Matter? Waiting until a couple summers ago to realize things have been hard for Black people is like needing to see that documentary to know SeaWorld is bad. Like, did you know whales shouldnâ€™t live in a sink?
[scattered clapping]
But you know what we did? We realized things were hard, and white women really got out there. They protested, they advocated, you know, they really tried to do the work, but then something devastating happened to a lot of us white women. A lot of us white women realized weâ€™re the ones whoâ€™ve been racist this whole time. We were shocked. We were so shocked, we pulled our purse closer. But even after that, we were like, â€œWow, we didnâ€™t even know we were like this.â€ â€œFrom now on, weâ€™re going to learn.â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to listen, weâ€™re going to hear, weâ€™re going to open a small Black business.â€ â€œBut most importantly, from now on, weâ€™re going to do better.â€ â€œWe want to do better.â€ And honestly, all jokes aside, thatâ€™s all we can do as a society. We canâ€™t change the past. All we can do is better in the future. I genuinely think thatâ€™s the path forward for us.
[scattered whooping and clapping]
Exceptâ€¦ thatâ€™s almost exactly what men said after Me Too, and we found that answer completely unacceptable. Men were like, â€œUs? The whole time? We didnâ€™t even know.â€ â€œFrom now on, we want to learn and listen and hear and open a small Black business.â€ â€œBut most importantly, from now on, we want to do better.â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to do better.â€ And we were like, â€œNo, not good enough.â€ â€œYou all have to die.â€ â€œEvery one of you. Doesnâ€™t matter what you did.â€ â€œYou could have raped somebody or accidentally whispered into a boob.â€ â€œItâ€™s all the same.â€ â€œAnd you have to die.â€ Me Too was the worst-run movement Iâ€™ve ever seen. I was so frustrated by it because I think we genuinely could have made social change. We could have made things better for women and men, but we fucked it up from the very beginning. And I tried. I tried to get involved in Me Too. I didnâ€™t want to get Me Tooâ€™d. Not how I wanted to get involved. I thought the more fun way to get involved would be to, like, Me Too men, you know? But that didnâ€™t really work out. That just turned into three one-night stands. Itâ€™s really hard to Me Too a guy. You ever tried to Me Too a man? Itâ€™s very hard. You go up to a guy at work, youâ€™re like, â€œHey, nice ass.â€ Heâ€™ll be like, â€œOh my God, no one has ever complimented my body.â€ â€œMost people call me smart and capable.â€ â€œBut you made me feel pretty.â€ â€œAnd I touch your boobs.â€ Itâ€™s hard, you know? Everyone has different lines, you know? I donâ€™t even think some men know where their line is. I think some men go so far past their line, when they finally turn around and see it, theyâ€™re like, â€œI have to go home.â€ And also, men, you like gross things. You do. You know this about yourselves. You like gross things. Like, I was in Thailand, and I went to one of those Ping-Pong shows.
[man exclaims]
If you donâ€™t know what they are, itâ€™s not a game of Ping-Pong. I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s a littleâ€¦ A little bit a game of Ping-Pong. Itâ€™s these shows where women put Ping-Pongs and other things in their vaginas, and then they shoot them out at quite a velocity. I meanâ€¦ these things really come at you. And itâ€™s not just Ping-Pongs. One lady smoked out of her vagina. Another lady sucked up a little goldfish and then spit that guy back out. And it was still alive. Which I thought was very impressive. Thatâ€™s like a solid pH that ladyâ€™s working with.
[scattered clapping]
[woman whoops]
Of course, the main event, they put Ping-Pongs in their vaginas, and then they shoot them out. And Iâ€™m tellingâ€¦ They really come at ya. This isnâ€™t even a joke, they give you paddles to hit them away with. And you wanna hit them away. Thereâ€™s probably some guys who are like, â€œOh no, I missed.â€ [sniffs]
[audience exclaims]
Oh, if the guy youâ€™re with â€œOhâ€™dâ€ too loud, heâ€™s one of them. And I donâ€™t know if this is just â€™cause Iâ€™m like a competitive person, but as soon as I saw this, I started to wonder which of those things I could do. Every woman in this room, I think we all have the ability to smoke out of our vaginas. I thinkâ€¦ I think we can all do that. I just wouldnâ€™t do it if youâ€™re pregnant, you know? You donâ€™t want your baby to think heâ€™s, like, too cool. You know? The fish oneâ€¦ The fish one, I would never try. I would never try the fish one because if the fish died, I would be mortified. Iâ€™d be like, â€œWhat? Too fishy for you?â€ The Ping-Pong one, thatâ€™s the one you want to know about yourself. Every woman in this room is asking herself the same question right now. Say it with me. â€œCan I shoot Ping-Pongs out of my vagina?â€
[cheers and applause]
So I tried, and now Iâ€™m just chock-full of Ping-Pongs. If anyone wants to play a game later, just drop-kick me in the stomach. Get some of those Ping-Pongs out, and hopefully that baby.
[scattered whooping and clapping]
You gotta keep abortion jokes early in the set, you know? [chuckling] Before itâ€™s a baby, soâ€¦ The point is, the only reason I tell that story is because that show only exists because men, you like gross things. Thereâ€™s no female version of that show. Weâ€™re not going anywhere to see men shoot anything out of their bodies. In fact, the one thing you do shoot out of your bodies, oftentimes weâ€™re like, â€œHey, can you wipe this off?â€ â€œIâ€™m getting sticky.â€ Thatâ€™s one of the reasons I think Me Too is confusing for men, â€™cause thereâ€™s some weird gross Me Toos out there, but I think theyâ€™re all things men would have liked if it happened to them. Like if I went up to a guy at a party, and I was like, â€œHey, I saw you from across the room and then I came into a bush.â€ I think if I said that to a guy at a party, he would be like, â€œTell me more about that.â€ Coming into a bush at a party, thatâ€™s like a classic Harvey Weinstein, I donâ€™t know, bit? [chuckles] He was kind of like the cornerstone of the whole Me Too movement. And rightfully so. He did a lot of terrible things. You know, and he was on trial. A lot of women testified against him. And this one woman testified, she goes, â€œHarvey offered me a role in exchange for sex.â€ â€œAnd when I said no, he goes, â€˜Then youâ€™ll never make it in Hollywood because thatâ€™s how a lot of women make it in Hollywood.'â€ And then, supposedly, he started naming names. Heâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s how Charlize Theron made it, Salma Hayek.â€ And thatâ€™s the part you never really think about. You know, for, like, all the bad Me Toos out there, thereâ€™s, like, a couple success ones.
[audience exclaims]
Yeah, it makes this whole thing a lot grayer, doesnâ€™t it? But you should not have to give a blowjob to get ahead. You should not have todo it. But you can. This is just about knowing your skill set. You know whoâ€™d be really mad to hear this information? Prostitutes. Theyâ€™re like, â€œYou got an Oscar? I got $50.â€ Personally, I donâ€™t think I could ever do it, you know, just because the guys who offer it are all kind of gross, you know? Theyâ€™re like the Harvey Weinsteins, the Roger Ailes. Likeâ€¦ I would talk about it. Iâ€™m a bit of a talker, you know. Iâ€™d be like, â€œOh no, smells down here. Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.â€ [Michelle chuckling]
[scattered whooping]
[scattered clapping]
This was a lot more complicated of a situation than we let it be. We needed to have conversations around it, and we couldnâ€™t even have conversations. You were either Me Too or Me Against. There werenâ€™t even levels. There should have been some levels. You know, like â€œMe Too.â€ â€œMe Kinda.â€ â€œMe Didnâ€™t Know.â€ [chuckles] â€œMe Criminal.â€ [chuckles] And some stuff, some truly terrible stuff happened to women. And other stuff, I was like, â€œNo, you just had a weird sex thing.â€ I heard one woman say this man put his penis on her forehead during sex, and she said that was a Me Too. I was like, â€œNo you just had weird sex.â€ â€œThatâ€™s the day you found out if you like a penis on your forehead.â€ â€œAnd if you do, guess what. Me too.â€ Soâ€¦ â€œYou got any ideas in there?â€ Itâ€™s fun, try it later. Uhâ€¦ You know, ask. [chuckles softly] We needed to have conversations, you need to be able to ask questions, because everyone has a different line. You know, one womanâ€™s line is another womanâ€™s rope she likes to be tied up with. Youâ€™d hear a lot of women say, â€œMen shouldnâ€™t use their power to have sex.â€ Other women would be like, â€œI like when men use their power to have sex.â€ And then men were like, â€œCan you tell us which one you are?â€ And we were like, â€œNo,â€ but for different reasons. You hear some women be like, â€œThis man, he hit on me at work, thatâ€™s harassment, it made me feel uncomfortable.â€ Like, â€œOkay, do you want no one to hit on you at work?â€ â€œNo, I only want the men who I want to hit on me to hit on me at work.â€ â€œOkay. Do you want to make a list of who they are?â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™m mysterious.â€ â€œWell, then buckle up, Nancy Drew, you got some uncomfortable times headed your way.â€ And I didâ€¦ I genuinely saw men try to get better. You know? I saw men trying to listen to us and do better. Like, uh, I was inâ€¦ riding in a car with a guy, and he asked to hold my hand. And I wasnâ€™t used to that level of consent, you know? Likeâ€¦ I mean, I wasnâ€™t used to rape, either. Iâ€™m more of a social-cues girl. Andâ€¦ But he asked to hold my hand. And I was so taken aback by it that my first reaction was, â€œOh no! He must be sick or scared.â€ So I grabbed his hand, and I was like, â€œItâ€™s going to be okay, buddy.â€ You know, relationships are complicated. Things between us are complicated, you know. And women, you know, weâ€™re a little bit to blame for some of this stuff too. Like, uh, weâ€™re attracted to the most dangerous type of man. You know, we like those big, strong guys. Tall guys with broad shoulders. You know how many times Iâ€™ve said â€œI want a big strong guy who can pick me up and throw me against the wallâ€? And then other women have definitely said, â€œHe was big and strong, and then he threw me against the wall.â€ Same guy. Uhâ€¦ And I say weâ€™re partially responsible for that, because women, weâ€™re at the point now where we decide who we marry, we decide who we mate with. We are attracted to those guys, so we marry them, we have kids with them, we make more of them. If we really wanted to make society better, we could just stop doing that. We could only marryâ€¦ We could only marry short, soft-boned men. Get a whole generation of little Danny DeVitos running around. Thatâ€™s actually why I think a lot of men donâ€™t want to give women access to abortion. I think you know, deep down, that we could start deciding which of you gets to move ahead.
[whooping and clapping]
We could keep a whole database. We could be like, â€œNo, no, not him. He doesnâ€™t text back.â€ â€œSorry, Kevin, the futureâ€™s for communicators.â€ Weâ€™re also, inexplicablyâ€¦ Women, weâ€™re attracted to bad men. You know? Like, I donâ€™t know why, but weâ€™re just attracted to bad guys. Like, Charles Manson got wedding proposals in jail. Women heard what Charles Manson did, and they thought, â€œIâ€™d like to be in a relationship with that man.â€ Even Charles Manson had to be like, â€œYou wanna be in a relationship with me? Thatâ€™s a red flag.â€ Weâ€™re, like, oddly attracted to serial killers. Anytime Netflix comes out with a new documentary about serial killers, weâ€™re, like, attracted to them. Itâ€™s crazy to me, â€™cause one, theyâ€™re serial killers, and two, it makes me think about how we donâ€™t have many female serial killers. And the ones we do all kind of make sense, you know? Theyâ€™re all prostitutes who killed their johns. And I can see how that could go south, you know? Sheâ€™s probably like, â€œWhereâ€™s my Oscar?â€ [chuckles] But male serial killers, we know the same thing about all of you. Male serial killers all had terrible moms. But a lot of us women, we have terrible dads, and we donâ€™t turn into serial killers. We just turn into people who have sex with other dads. It makes me so frustrated at women. Iâ€™m like, â€œCan you stop being a people-pleaser for five fucking minutes and get to murdering?â€

Part 3: News to Me + All Beautiful
[Michelle] Hi, guys, how are you?
[upbeat music playing]
[audience cheering and clapping]
Itâ€™s fine, I donâ€™t really care.
[audience laughs]
I always like being here in Philadelphia.
[audience exclaims]
I love being here in Denver. You guys, you know you have a good town.
[audience cheering]
[chuckling] Always happy to be here in Salt Lake.
[cheering and clapping]
I love coming to Madison. I always love being back here.
[audience laughing]
This is gonna be fun. Weâ€™re gonna have a good time.
[cheers and applause rise and fade out]
I think a lot of times, women, we always feel like we have to, like, support other women, whichâ€¦ I donâ€™t think we need to do that. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Like, thatâ€™s, like, a lot to ask of a whole gender, you know? We donâ€™t ask that of men, you know? Like, men arenâ€™t like, â€œMen should support other men.â€ Thatâ€™s notâ€¦ Theyâ€™re just like, â€œWeâ€™ll invade. Itâ€™s okay.â€ Itâ€™s totally fine not to like otherâ€¦ Thereâ€™s plenty of women that I donâ€™t like, you know? But sometimes Iâ€™ll find out information about them that will at least, like, let me understand them. Like, I saw an article about Nancy Reagan. First of all, Iâ€™ve never been a fan of Nancy Reagan. I always thought she was a tiny little cunt. You know? Yeah. Thatâ€™s just my opinion. I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s notâ€¦ But I saw an article about her recently that made me at least understand her. Uh, the article talked about how in Hollywood in the â€™70s, Nancy Reagan was known as the throat GOAT. Yeah. Little old Nancy Reagan, in Hollywood in the â€™70s, was known for the best at giving blow jobs. Do you know how hard it is to be the best at giving blow jobs in Hollywood in the â€™70s? Thatâ€™s how people auditioned. And she was the best. She was the Michael Jordan of blow jobs. Little old Nancy Reagan. But then, after I read that, her whole life made sense to me. Itâ€™s like, of course she hated gay men. They were her competition. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWe gotta keep AIDS around, my cheeks are getting tired.â€ [Michelle chuckles] You know, I saw that news storyâ€¦ I actually read that news story like I feel like a lot of us read news these days. Which is, I saw it, and I wanted to believe it was true, so then I just did. You know, like, I didnâ€™t check sources or anything. Now that Iâ€™m thinking about it, I really wanna know what the sources are. Itâ€™s like a bunch of older men who are likeâ€¦ [mumbles] You know? You know sheâ€™s really good if that was the one thing Ronald Reagan remembered. â€œWhen Nancy puts me in her mouthâ€¦â€ â€œHey, this is a Cabinet meeting, okay?â€ â€œSomeone get him more jelly beans. We needâ€¦â€ [Michelle chuckles] But I think thatâ€™s what a lot of us do now when we look at the news, you know? We see something that kind of fits in line with what we want to believe, and then because we feel itâ€™s true, it is. And thatâ€™s an incredibly dangerous place to be as a society. Plus, once somethingâ€™s out there about you, it doesnâ€™t actually matter if itâ€™s true or not, people will just believe it. Thereâ€™s some things out there about me that arenâ€™t true, but Iâ€™m sure people believe it. Like, after I did the Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner, I got a lot of trolling. And, to be honest, most trolling, very boring. You know, itâ€™s just repetitive. You know, a lot of itâ€™s like, â€œYou bitch, you cunt, you Carrot Top-looking motherfucker.â€ And thatâ€™s just me in the mirror, soâ€¦ Well, how do you come? I got one really good troll after the Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner. I appreciated this troll. It was creative. He put in time and effort. It was really good. What he did was he took what looked like a screenshot of my actual hometown newspaper, the Hershey Chronicle, and soâ€¦ I mean, the font was correct. A lot of information in the article was right. Like where I went to school, when I graduated, what I majored in. The meat of the article was incorrect. The headline read, â€œWolf pleads guilty to bestiality.â€ Out of the box, though, right? You know? And I tried to find this article again, and I just, I Googled â€œWolf bestiality.â€ I think I got a bit egotistical where I was just likeâ€¦ I was like, â€œOh, wait, I need more words than that.â€ But thatâ€™s a fun rabbit hole if you want to go down that one. But the title of this article said, â€œWolf pleads guilty to bestiality.â€ So now I find myself in the odd position to have to say things like, â€œNo, Iâ€™ve never had sex with a dog.â€ But as soon as you have to say youâ€™ve never had sex with a dog, it sounds like maybe youâ€™ve had sex with a dog. By the way, that was the bestiality they were referring to. They said my bestiality was dog sex. If, when I said bestiality, you pictured a different animal, guess what, thatâ€™s the animal you would have sex with. And now you know that about yourself, soâ€¦ Thatâ€™s fun and exciting, you know? This article, now, all of a sudden, it makes me think of things that I never even wanted to think about before, like, â€œHow do I have sex with a dog?? Iâ€™m a woman. How am I fucking a dog? So then Iâ€™d think about how Iâ€™d have sex with a dog. And I think the answer is you put peanut butter on your pussy. And now it sounds like Iâ€™ve maybe fucked a dog. By the way, if you ever do want to have sex with a dog, it said after I pleaded guilty that I only got 12 months probation and $1,100 fine. So, if thatâ€™s your thing, you might want to head over to Pennsylvania. It doesnâ€™t sound like itâ€™s gonna put you in that deep of a hole, you know? But weâ€™re in Wisconsin. Maybe check the laws here. They might be better. [chuckles]
[audience exclaims]
Thereâ€™s a lot of farmland. Thereâ€™s a lot of farmland. People get lonely. I get it. But, yeah, Iâ€™ve never had sex with a dog. But if I was going to, Iâ€™m not having sex with a rescue. [chuckles] Iâ€™m having sex with a purebred dog. A big, silky-coated dog. A dog who could really take care of me. And honestly, that would be fine if that was the only information out there about me. Um, itâ€™s not. Do you guys remember Jeffrey Epstein, like, of the pedophiles? So, at some point, someone put a list of all the people who apparently went to Epsteinâ€™s island out. And itâ€™s, like, a pretty good list. Itâ€™s got Barack Obama, BeyoncÃ©, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks. Also on the list, me. Well, thatâ€™s not good. Now it looks like I fuck kids and dogs. It looks like Iâ€™m really going out of my way not to have sex with men. Which, if I was interested in both kids and dogs, a perfect combination of that is men.
[scattered clapping]
And now I find myself in a position no one ever wants to be in, which is having to say the phrase, â€œNo, Iâ€™ve never had sex with a kid.â€ Iâ€™ve never even been to that island. But by the way, if all those people are going, Iâ€™m gonna go. You probably donâ€™t have to do anything there. You can probably just get a cocktail and see what Meryl Streepâ€™s into. Which hopefully is role-play. You know? Sheâ€™s a really good actress. I donâ€™t know. So, I know, I had to say things like â€œIâ€™ve never had sex with a kid.â€ And I havenâ€™t. But if I was going to have sex with a kid, I wouldnâ€™t go to some billionaireâ€™s island to do it. Iâ€™d do it the normal way and become a teacher.
[audience exclaims]
I know, we should pay them more. Get them supplies.
[upbeat music playing]
I hear all the time, women talk about how we should all be beautiful, how we should all feel beautiful. So itâ€™s like, â€œWeâ€™re all beautiful.â€ â€œWeâ€™re all beautiful.â€ Well, first of all, that means weâ€™re still valuing women on beauty. Weâ€™re like, â€œYou have to be beautiful to be important, so weâ€™ll just make sure every woman feels beautiful.â€ Which is maybe not the right metric. Also, a little problem with that plan, weâ€™re not all beautiful. [chuckles] The only reason you know someoneâ€™s beautiful is â€™cause youâ€™ve seen someone whoâ€™s not. Youâ€™re like, â€œYeah, thatâ€™s differentâ€¦ than that.â€ Like, recently, I was at the same event as Naomi Campbell, and people kept wanting us to take a picture together, and I was like, â€œNo!â€ â€œIâ€™m not gonna document how different humans can be.â€ â€œMy skill set doesnâ€™t come across in a photograph.â€
[scattered clapping]
[scattered whooping and clapping]
Not too much, okay, guys. [chuckles] Also, but how dare you? How dare you want every woman to be beautiful? Donâ€™t you think thereâ€™s women out there who knew they were ugly? They knew they were ugly, so they got good at something. They got respected for their abilities.
[cheering and applauding]
And thenâ€¦ And then some little bitch comes up to her, and sheâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re beautiful.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œNo, shut up.â€ â€œI got a horse face, and Iâ€™m an electrical engineer.â€ We gotta stop. We gotta stop with all this beautiful nonsense. We should even stop telling little girls theyâ€™re beautiful. I think as soon as they can understand us, you look that little girl right in the eye, and you go, â€œWith a face like that, you get good at math.â€
[scattered clapping and whooping]
â€œWeâ€™re all beautiful.â€ So muchâ€¦ So much of our existence is based off of beauty, and itâ€™s such a waste of time. Like, Victoriaâ€™s Secret just hired their first Down syndrome model. Donâ€™t worry, this isnâ€™t gonna be a joke about Down syndrome. You donâ€™t have to draw a real hard line in the sand. Victoriaâ€™s Secret just hired their first Down syndrome model and everyone was like, â€œThis is such a great accomplishment for women.â€ And, donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m glad that lady has a job. But, uh, can we stop acting like women posing with no clothes, or almost no clothes, is an accomplishment? Itâ€™s literally the least you could do. This is how little of an accomplishment it is. I couldnâ€™t think of something it was like. I kept thinking, like, I donâ€™t know, a baby learning how to use a spoon, and I was like, I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s still an accomplishment. It is literalâ€¦ Itâ€™s the least you can do. Thereâ€™s nothing impressive about it. Itâ€™s not moving the needle forward for women at all. We seem to have this idea that if every woman can pose nude, finally, weâ€™ll get ahead. Itâ€™s notâ€¦ Itâ€™s not doing anything for us, you know? Itâ€™s like, â€œWe want equality,â€ and then someone was like, â€œHow about every type of woman can be in a Dove commercial?â€ And we were like, â€œWeâ€™ll take it.â€ They were like, â€œReally? â€œThis feels like a whole â€˜beads for New Yorkâ€™ situation.â€ â€˜Cause weâ€™ve seen it. Weâ€™ve seen every type of woman. Every age, weight, race, number of arms, weâ€™ve seen it all. Thereâ€™s nothing impressive about it. You know? And we were the ones, womenâ€¦ We were the ones who needed to see it. You know, we saw what the standard model was, and we said, â€œI want that.â€ Men didnâ€™t do this. Men didnâ€™t put these ideas in our heads. Men saw every woman, and theyâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™ll take that one.â€ â€œYeah, thatâ€™s neat too. Okay.â€ â€œLine â€™em up.â€ Thatâ€™s what it feels like. It feels like weâ€™re trying to get verification that a man will jerk off to anything. Thatâ€™s how low the bar is for men. Itâ€™s like, â€œOh, Chad, heâ€™ll beat it to almost anything.â€ Weâ€™re like, â€œHeâ€™s an ally.â€ Also, like, women, you should want to be a little bit ugly. I promise, itâ€™ll help you out. I get called ugly all the time. I donâ€™t care, I have a skill. I donâ€™t care. Also, I hope I age terribly. â€˜Cause the uglier I get, the better this all works.
[audience applauding]
The uglier I get, the more people I can make fun of. Like, I canâ€™t do any accents or impressions. Okay? Thereâ€™s one accent I can do, and itâ€™s a very offensive Asian accent. Donâ€™t ask me how I know, okay? I wanna get so ugly that I can do that accent and even Asian people will be like, â€œItâ€™s okay.â€ And also, women, if youâ€™re a little bit ugly, men are gonna be much more likely to believe youâ€™re capable. And women too, by the way. Women are muchâ€¦ Theyâ€™re also gonna believe youâ€™re more capable if youâ€™re a little bit ugly. If you have a bit of a busted faceâ€¦ and youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m a mathematician,â€ people will be like, â€œThat tracks. Yeah.â€ Oh, donâ€™t get sad about it, itâ€™s true. You are the problem. [chuckles] â€œThatâ€™s sad, she thinks sheâ€™s ugly?â€ Who cares? Sheâ€™s got a fucking job. Oh, this lady is so drunk, it doesnâ€™t matter. Look at some of our most successful women. We donâ€™t really think about these women because we never equate womenâ€™s success with, like, not being beautiful. But some of our most successful women, very ugly people. Some of these references are a little old. Theyâ€™re just my personal favorites. Janet Reno.
[woman cheers]
[man] Reno!
Janet Reno was the first female attorney general. One of the longest-ever serving attorney generals. Worked for Democrats, Republicans, this lady was great at attorney general-ing.
[light clapping]
If you canâ€™t remember what Janet Reno looks like, she looked like what Larry Bird looks like now. For context, Will Ferrell played her on Saturday Night Live. And his costume was, like, a little bit of lipstick. Not a pretty lady. Everyone trusted her. [Michelle chuckles] Everyoneâ€™s favorite, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[audience cheering and applauding]
Yeah. Ugly little old bird. She actually looks like a birdâ€™s foot. All, like, wrinkly and bony, and, like, a little bitâ€¦ You know. Great Supreme Court Justice. Not a pretty lady. No oneâ€™s slinging dicks at Ruth. Itâ€™s just suchâ€¦ Itâ€™s such a waste of time. Itâ€™s a waste of all of our times and our talents. Then for a while, there was this group of women. They were the â€œI donâ€™t careâ€ women. And, honestly, thatâ€™s like the right lane to be in. But these women were pretending they didnâ€™t care. They actually cared because they posted about how much they didnâ€™t care on social media. Theyâ€™re like, â€œI donâ€™t care what you think, Iâ€™m confident.â€ â€œI donâ€™t care, Iâ€™m confident.â€ Feels like youâ€™re trying to â€œBeetlejuiceâ€ confidence. But these â€œI donâ€™t careâ€ women, they donâ€™t wear makeup, work out, do their hair, they donâ€™t care. If thatâ€™s what you want to do, thatâ€™s totally fine. But what are you doing? â€˜Cause I know how much time all of that takes me. So, if youâ€™re not doing that, what are you doing? Are you attorney general? Are you fluent in all the languages? How are you spending all of this extra time? Like, men have never really cared about how theyâ€™ve looked. But they have almost everything to show for it. They invented almost everything. Theyâ€™re like, â€œSo sorry I look like this, but hereâ€™s electricity.â€ â€œNo, wait till it gets dark. This is gonna blow your mind.â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna be able to stare in the mirror longer.â€ And the worst part is, these â€œI donâ€™t careâ€ women, they were getting grouped in with powerful women. Like, â€œLook at these â€˜I donâ€™t careâ€™ women.â€ â€œLook at them, theyâ€™re such great examples.â€ No, youâ€™re not a powerful woman, youâ€™re a mediocre man. And if thatâ€™s what you want to be, thatâ€™s fine. Having openly mediocre women, I think thatâ€™s a big step forward. I think thatâ€™s really good for women. If you want to be mediocre, you do it. You lean into it. Have fun. Wear elastic. But know youâ€™re mediocre. You know, donâ€™t you go blaming stuff on sexism. If you donâ€™t get a promotion, donâ€™t be like, â€œThatâ€™s sexist.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œNo, you donâ€™t know Excel.â€ Itâ€™s an intuitive program. But thatâ€™s the kindâ€¦ Thatâ€™s the kind of equality I want for women. I want true equality for women. I want women to be just as good as men, just as mediocre, and just as shitty. You know? I want us to be in charge of stuff. Iâ€™d love to see us leave our kids.
[scattered clapping and whooping]
And Iâ€™d like to see a few serial killers. Good ones too. Like, good, creepy, dead-eyed, wear-your-skin serial killers.
[woman whooping]
The kind Netflix makes a documentary about, and afterwards, people are like, â€œSheâ€™s cute, though.â€ [chuckles]

Hey, itâ€™s Andrew Santino, and here I am in my hometown, Chicago, Illinois, where Iâ€™m shooting my stand-up comedy special, but before I do, I want to take you around my city, and I want to show you the gems that people donâ€™t talk about, locals-only type of stuff. Hey, excuse me. Can I get a ride?
No.
Okay. Fair enough. Chicago. Well, I have a meeting, and I donâ€™t know you.
Itâ€™s fine. I get that.
Why should I evenâ€¦ You know, thatâ€™s an odd question to ask. Youâ€™re right. Now that I think about itâ€¦ In the city here, with all the crime and everything, â€“ just hop in and get a ride?
Youâ€™re right. Best city in the world, babyâ€¦ Chicago. Boom, a local spotâ€¦ Willis Tower, on the corner, of course, of Jackson and Wacker. Now, Jackson and Wacker is famous â€™cause of Andrew Jackson and because people used to get whacked. Right below me, the Chicago Pond, a beautiful piece of water. People swim in here. Olympics train in this thing. Jordan actually was inside the mold when they molded him. They cracked it, pulled him out, reassembled it. Boom. Here we are at The Wienerâ€™s Circle, broâ€¦ The best hot dog in Chicago. And they treat me like Iâ€™m from here. Come on in. Hey, let me get a hot dog, ladies.
How do you want it?
You know how I want it, man. What, up your ass or down your fucking throat? Come on, order correctly, pussy lips. Letâ€™s get it together. Before I continue this tour, Iâ€™m gonna get a drink. Ah, double fisting. Chi Town is a drinking city. Everybody knows that. Ah, beers for the crew, beers for the crew, beers for the crew. Cheers, you guys. Cheers. Okay, we had more planned. Weâ€™re never gonna get to it. You want to know more about Chicago, Google it, okay? Enjoy the special. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my grandsonâ€¦ Andrew Santino. We did it. We did it. Yes. Chicago, Illinois, my hometown, how are you? Yes. Crazy. Thatâ€™s my grandmother, man. Yeah, thatâ€™s the best thing in the world. My grandmother brought me up. Give it up for Mary Garrity, man. Cheers. Cheers to you guys. Cheers. My grandfather, who passed away, used to sayâ€¦ A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, â€˜What is that?â€™ And sheâ€™d say, â€˜Itâ€™s water.â€™ And he said, â€˜Iâ€™m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.â€™ So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. Weâ€™re here. Iâ€™m so happy to be back in this city. Iâ€™m back home. Itâ€™s amazing. Iâ€™m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, thatâ€¦ Ah, Chicago. Itâ€™s Chicago. â€˜Aâ€™ s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? â€˜Aâ€™s, ahs, T, Ds, everyoneâ€™s racist. Itâ€™s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, â€˜You know what? Why donâ€™t you suck my dick?â€™ And the other guy goes, â€˜Pfft! You suck my dick.â€™ And I was like, â€˜Hey, suck each otherâ€™s dicks, man.â€™ That wouldâ€™ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, â€˜You motherfucker.â€™ Finish him. Finish him.
We got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that â€™cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, â€˜Suck my dick.â€™ We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like itâ€™s a bad thing. Itâ€™s the best thing in the world. Itâ€™s the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, â€˜Hey! â€˜Suck my dick, please, if you have time. â€˜If you donâ€™t, itâ€™s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.â€™
Iâ€™m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. Itâ€™s where my family is from. My familyâ€™s still here. Itâ€™s great to come home, see my parents. Theyâ€™re getting older, which is weird. Thatâ€™s a hard thing, to see your parents get olderâ€¦ Like, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, â€˜Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.â€™ Like, my mom was like, â€˜Well, Iâ€™m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?â€™ And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, â€˜Eat steak, watch porn.â€™ I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. Theyâ€™re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. Theyâ€™re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I donâ€™t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs â€™cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, â€˜Iâ€™ m not gonna fuck up two of them. â€˜We canâ€™t do that. Oneâ€™s good. Weâ€™ll fuck up one. Thatâ€™s okay.â€™ We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. Sheâ€™s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat religious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? Theyâ€™re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, â€˜Now I lay me down to sleep.â€™ Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I â€˜d say,â€™ Now I lay me down to sleep. â€˜I pray the Lord my soul to keep, â€˜and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.â€™ I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thingâ€¦ for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? Iâ€™m six. Iâ€™m gonna die in the middle of the night, and Godâ€™s gonna leave my body, take my soul, but be like, â€˜Bodyâ€™ s good. Leave the body. Itâ€™s fine. Leave it.â€™ Whatâ€™s going on?
Crazy person. I love her. Sheâ€™s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think Iâ€™m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, â€˜Heads, yes, tails, no.â€™ Iâ€™d flip it, Iâ€™d get tails, and Iâ€™d go, â€˜Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let â€˜s see what happens.â€™ He didnâ€™t beat me, never won. Thatâ€™s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, thatâ€™s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, â€˜You donâ€™ t lock the doors inside of the house. â€˜If youâ€™ re locking the doors inside of the house, it means youâ€™re doing something you shouldnâ€™t be doing.â€™ Yeah, thatâ€™s why we lock the doors. Donâ€™t come in here. Iâ€™m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. Thatâ€™s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house mustâ€™ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. Heâ€™s like, â€˜You know what? Thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m gonna put locks inside the house.â€™ She â€˜s like,â€™ Michael, what are you doing? â€˜We have locks on the outside of the house â€˜to keep criminals from coming inside. Thereâ€™s no criminals inside of this house.â€™ Yes, there are, Karen, and theyâ€™re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen.
Anyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. Itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. Itâ€™s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, thatâ€™s a big thing. My mom is like, â€˜How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?â€™ Itâ€™s like, â€˜Yeah, itâ€™s better than this. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m out there. What are you talking about?â€™ Itâ€™s always better. Itâ€™s always better. It is. Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff that isnâ€™t better, but the weatherâ€™s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the â€˜feels likeâ€™ meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guyâ€™s like, â€˜Itâ€™s 62. Feels like 68.â€™ Thatâ€™s Midwest hope. Thatâ€™s hope circulating in your body. Itâ€™s the greatest lie ever told. Whoâ€™s the â€˜feels likeâ€™ guy? I want that job. If thatâ€™s a job, I want it tonight. Iâ€™ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The â€˜feels likeâ€™ guyâ€¦ Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, itâ€™s 62 on the barometer. Weâ€™re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? Howâ€™s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man.
Itâ€™s nice, really nice out. Itâ€™s crazy, man, â€™cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when I come back, youâ€™re never surprised. Like, youâ€™re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I donâ€™t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I donâ€™t give a shit. Theyâ€™re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. Theyâ€™re terrible. Theyâ€™re terrible people.
I feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. Theyâ€™re never not dying. Theyâ€™re always dying. Thereâ€™s, like, a week when itâ€™s like, â€˜We might make it,â€™ and thatâ€™s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, â€™cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. Iâ€™m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy â€™cause I feel bad for him. I know what heâ€™s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And Iâ€™ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, â€˜Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don â€˜t have a calendar.â€™ You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. Thatâ€™s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, â€˜Oh, letâ€™ s get the fuck out of here. â€˜Itâ€™ s cold. Letâ€™s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.â€™ But I donâ€™t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at allâ€¦ I really donâ€™t. I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t feel bad for them. Some people are like, â€˜Oh, thatâ€™s kind of mean.â€™ I donâ€™t give a shit. I donâ€™t give a shit, â€™cause I live amongst these people, and theyâ€™re rude. Theyâ€™re rude. You know why theyâ€™re rude? â€˜Cause they made it. Theyâ€™re at the promised land. Itâ€™s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach.
I came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless guy, said, â€˜Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?â€™ Okay? Iâ€™m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, â€˜Whatâ€™s in it?â€™ And I looked at him, and I said, â€˜Tomorrow.â€™ Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. Youâ€™re cock-blocking me, man. Iâ€™m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough. Who are you?
But I like it. Itâ€™s my second home. This is my first home. L.A.â€™s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. Itâ€™s kind of like up here. Itâ€™s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. Iâ€™ve ever lived in in my life. Itâ€™s safe. Itâ€™s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? Iâ€™m not gay, Dad, butâ€¦ Iâ€™m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. Iâ€™ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that.
Theyâ€™re people just like you and me. Thereâ€™s nothing different. Thereâ€™s nothing different about that neighborhood. Itâ€™s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. Iâ€™ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And thatâ€™s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s a thing. Itâ€™s an underbelly thing. Itâ€™s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and Iâ€™m okay with that. Itâ€™s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But Iâ€™ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now Iâ€™m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and Iâ€™m like, â€˜All right, you couldnâ€™t handle it, dude. â€˜You couldnâ€™ t handle it. Too tight, too tight. â€˜Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.â€™ Couldnâ€™t have it.
Thatâ€™s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. Weâ€™re stupid people by nature. Weâ€™re just dumb. We donâ€™t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, â€˜Men are dumb.â€™ I donâ€™t care. You think I care you think Iâ€™m dumb? I donâ€™t give a shit. I know Iâ€™m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. Thatâ€™s what you guys do all day. Itâ€™s like, â€˜I heard he was with her, but then she wasâ€™â€¦ And we just walk around likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s great. Itâ€™s fantastic. I donâ€™t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and Iâ€™m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, itâ€™s a little bit different, â€™cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go likeâ€¦ Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. Hey, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, â€˜Hey, hey.â€™ We donâ€™t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that Iâ€™m not a pussy. I go, â€˜Hey, whatâ€™ s up? We good, we good? â€˜Weâ€™re good. Iâ€™m good with the black guy. â€˜In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. â€˜Weâ€™ re good. We got one. Weâ€™re good, weâ€™re good. We got him.â€™ I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. Thereâ€™s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you canâ€™t do that in my neighborhood â€™cause it means something totally differentâ€¦ and it hurts. It hurts a lot.
I like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I donâ€™t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms genderâ€¦ Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didnâ€™t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. Theyâ€™re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroomâ€™s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I â€˜m like,â€™ Aah! â€˜There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. â€˜I donâ€™ t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they â€˜ll do?â€™ Who do you think you are?
It was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And Iâ€™m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I donâ€™t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. Itâ€™s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, â€˜Hi, our lineâ€™ s too long. â€˜Do you think meâ€¦ Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?â€™ I know thatâ€™s a stereotypical impression. I donâ€™t give a shit. Thatâ€™s real. â€˜Can we cut?â€™ Thatâ€™s real. And every asshole in line is like, â€˜Yeah, go ahead.â€™ Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and Iâ€™m tired of that shit, â€™cause we canâ€™t use your bathrooms. Guys canâ€™t use girlsâ€™ bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why canâ€™t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, â€˜Well, you pee on the seat.â€™ Do we? I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t pee on the seat. If you live with someone that pees on the seat, itâ€™s â€™cause they hate your fucking guts. Theyâ€™re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking asshole. Heâ€™s saying something to you. Thatâ€™s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk in the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and itâ€™s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. Thatâ€™s amazing. Itâ€™s ridiculous.
To me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from menâ€™s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesnâ€™t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We donâ€™t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of menâ€™s bathrooms in bars because they shouldnâ€™t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, â€™cause a girl canâ€™t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s this way or that way. I donâ€™t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldnâ€™t be stalls in menâ€™s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? Youâ€™re gonna poop at the bar? Youâ€™re gonna poop here? Steve, youâ€™re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that weâ€™re at, youâ€™re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at theâ€¦ Who are your friends? Whoâ€™s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? Youâ€™re gross. Youâ€™re a gross human. You donâ€™t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-upâ€¦ like a full-grown adult. If youâ€™re pooping at the bar that Iâ€™m at and I see you doing that, Iâ€™m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, â€˜Hey, thereâ€™ s a guy pooping here â€˜wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He â€˜s pooping right now.â€™ And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? â€˜Cause you pooped here, Mike. Whatâ€™s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, â€˜Go home, you pig. You make me sick.â€™
Unbelievable, man, how we proteâ€¦ We protect the bathrooms like theyâ€™re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like itâ€™s something important. Itâ€™s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and youâ€™re like, â€˜Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? Itâ€™s locked.â€™ Theyâ€™re like, â€˜Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.â€™ Itâ€™s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. Itâ€™s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. Youâ€™re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen? Thereâ€™s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, â€˜Hey, whatâ€™s up, you guys?â€™ Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real.
Itâ€™s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didnâ€™t want to talk about anything thatâ€™s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, itâ€™s the late show, Iâ€™ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. Iâ€™m proud to be from where Iâ€™m from, okay? Iâ€™m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. Iâ€™m proud to be from the United States of America. Iâ€™m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. Itâ€™s unfortunate as fuck. Itâ€™s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isnâ€™t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So donâ€™t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s it. Good.
Iâ€™m aâ€¦ Iâ€™m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. â€˜Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. Youâ€™re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? Youâ€™re gross. Youâ€™re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, â€˜Ah, we ran out of time. â€˜No, put the genitals on the outside. â€˜It doesnâ€™ t matter. â€˜No oneâ€™ s gonna see. Who cares? â€˜Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.â€™ Itâ€™s phenomenal. Every day weâ€™ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, â€˜Ah, tricked them. â€˜We tricked them again. We got away with murder.â€™ I donâ€™t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I justâ€¦ Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it?
Itâ€™s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. Thatâ€™s all heâ€™s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonair at the bar. You â€˜re like,â€™ Well, well, I work for an investment firm downtown.â€™ But what youâ€™re really saying is, like, â€˜I want to put my body in your body. Iâ€™d like to put my body inside of your body.â€™ Thatâ€™s all it is. Youâ€™re not that cool. Youâ€™re just trying to put some of your body in someoneâ€™s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? Thatâ€™s it. Think about thatâ€¦ Thatâ€™s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl Iâ€™m the guy that you want to do things with.
Think about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. Thatâ€™s it. Thereâ€™s really nothing going on, just a lot ofâ€¦ Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They donâ€™t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women likeâ€¦ What are you selling? She doesnâ€™t know. You canâ€™t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the packâ€¦ on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon.
It was likeâ€¦
Everything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I wouldâ€™ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That wouldâ€™ve been amazing. Right? The first guy thatâ€™s likeâ€¦ Thatâ€™s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were likeâ€¦ What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. Itâ€™s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddyâ€™s an artist, and I was like, â€˜I want a fucking papa bear â€˜with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, â€˜and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls â€˜and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.â€™ And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing.
The Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. Itâ€™s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You canâ€™t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Whereâ€™s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. Iâ€™m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Donâ€™t clap for that. Please donâ€™t clap for that shit â€™cause it eggs her on, and I donâ€™t need that.
No, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she â€˜s like,â€™ What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?â€™ We didnâ€™t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didnâ€™t really get into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, â€˜Well, whatever you want to do.â€™ She was like, â€˜Do you want to have a bachelor party?â€™ And I was like, â€˜I donâ€™ t know. â€˜Like, I do stand-up for a living, â€˜so, like, itâ€™ s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.â€™ I was like, â€˜No, Iâ€™m good.â€™ You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, â€˜Thatâ€™s good enough for me.â€™ I was like, â€˜You can do a bachelorette party. Don â€˜t feel like you canâ€™t.â€™ She was like, â€˜Are you cool with it?â€™ I was like, â€˜I promise. Iâ€™m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you â€˜re good. Do it.â€™ She was like, â€˜Okay, trust me. It â€˜ll be classy.â€™ Thatâ€™s some dumb shit. Girls are like, â€˜Itâ€™ s gonna be classy. â€˜The bachelorette partyâ€¦ Itâ€™s gonna be claâ€¦ I promise. We wonâ€™t be as crazy as you think weâ€™re gonna be.â€™ She was like, â€˜Weâ€™ re going to Northern California â€˜to a vineyard. We â€˜re gonna do wine tasting.â€™ So in girlsâ€™ brains, they think that we think that thatâ€™s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know theyâ€™re not wine tasting. I know theyâ€™re blacking out on wine. I know theyâ€™re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town likeâ€¦ I know. I know what youâ€™re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunksâ€¦ trying to pretend likeâ€¦ We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. Itâ€™s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, thatâ€™s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends.
See, â€™cause hereâ€™s the thing about bachelorette parties. Iâ€™m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then youâ€™re a piece of shit. Then youâ€™re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, â€˜Look at us, penises everywhere. â€˜Penises on our body. â€˜Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. â€˜These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. â€˜These are dick glasses. Theyâ€™re dick shoes. â€˜Look at it. It comes. This one comes. â€˜It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.â€™ Whatâ€™s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. Itâ€™s unbelievableâ€¦ Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at nightâ€¦ theyâ€™re just like, â€˜Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.â€™ Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, â€˜Cocks, cocks on my head.â€™ You psycho.
Thatâ€™s where guys beat you. Thatâ€™s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor party where theyâ€™re like, â€˜Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let â€˜s go.â€™ I put one on likeâ€¦ â€˜Come on, letâ€™ s go. â€˜Get mine wet. Steve, get mine wet. â€˜Get it wet. Get the clit wet. â€˜Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.â€™ â€˜Vaginer.â€™ We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Rica. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didnâ€™t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and Iâ€™m like, â€˜Oh, my God, what happened?â€™ To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who weâ€™re buddies with, is like, â€˜Oh, yeah, the fight?â€™ And I was like, â€˜Yeah, what happened?â€™ Iâ€™m ready for the story. And he â€˜s like,â€™ Okay, you see this guy on the ground? â€˜You see him on the ground, â€˜this guy who they kick in the face? â€˜You see him? â€˜You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?â€™ I was like, â€˜Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?â€™ And he goes, â€˜Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he â€˜s from Panama.â€™ What? â€˜Heâ€™ s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.â€™ Thatâ€™s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. â€˜Heâ€™s from Panama.â€™ Thatâ€™s it. I was like, â€˜But how did the fightâ€¦ Like, how did youâ€¦ How did the fight happen?â€™ He goes, â€˜Oh, sÃ­, sÃ­, sÃ­, sÃ­, sÃ­, sÃ­. â€˜Okay, so this guy on the ground, â€˜he cut off this guy in traffic, â€˜and he says to him, â€˜Hey, what the fuck?â€™ â€˜And this guy, he says, â€˜Hey, man, fuck you.â€™ â€˜So this guy, he gets out of his car, â€˜and he says, â€˜Mm-mm, fuck you.â€™ â€˜So then they yell at each other. â€˜So this guy say fuck you. â€˜This guy, fuck you. This guy, fuckâ€¦ So both of these guys are fucking you right now.â€™ I was like, â€˜No oneâ€™ s fucking me. What are you talking about?â€™ â€˜And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, â€˜and his friend, he says, â€˜Hey, what happened?â€™ â€˜He says, â€˜He said, fuck you.â€™ â€˜He says,â€™ Ah, fuck you.â€™ â€˜He says, â€˜Fuck you.â€™ He says. â€˜Fuck you.â€™ He fuckâ€¦ these guys over here are fucking you.â€™ â€˜And the one guy, he says to himâ€¦ â€˜Before he fight with him, he says, â€Hey, motherfucker, where are you from?â€™ â€˜And this guy, he says, â€˜Panama.â€™ â€˜And, uhâ€¦ That â€˜s it for him.â€™ Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? Itâ€™s, likeâ€¦ We went zip-lining. Itâ€™s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-peopleâ€¦ White-water rafting is white-people shit. Itâ€™s called white-water rafting. Itâ€™s ours. Thatâ€™s some white-people shit. Youâ€™ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. Thatâ€™s just not what they do. Itâ€™s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing?
No way.
White-water rafting?
No.
None of the above. Do you even like coffee?
I do like coffee.
Oh, come on, man. What did he say?
I like it black.
You like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what Iâ€™m talking about. He knows. I went to college withâ€¦ One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He â€˜s like,â€™ Youâ€™re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.â€™ I was like, â€˜Iâ€™m taking out the trash.â€™ Heâ€™s likeâ€¦ â€˜Thatâ€™s the type of shit Iâ€™m talking about, motherfucker. â€˜Just throw that shit outside, bitch. â€˜White-people shit! â€˜What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.â€™ What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charminâ€™â€¦
I did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, thatâ€™s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We donâ€™t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? Iâ€™ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I donâ€™t give a shit. Iâ€™ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. Weâ€™re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. Theyâ€™re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. Thereâ€™s a cute little Italian couple thatâ€™s like, â€˜Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.â€™ And you â€˜re like,â€™ Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.â€™ Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All Iâ€™m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. Youâ€™re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that, you know. Hereâ€™s why. Every time Iâ€™ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, thereâ€™s always one guy in the crew, one dude whoâ€™s like, â€˜Hey, I got us. I can take us around. â€˜I speak a little bit of Mexican. â€˜Weâ€™ re gonna be good. We â€˜ll be good.â€™ You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Donâ€™t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. Weâ€™re gonna be straight. And youâ€™re like, â€˜All right, man. I canâ€™t wait.â€™ You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, â€˜Hello, American, americano, â€˜American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.â€™ â€˜Cause I donâ€™t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You canâ€™t fuck me. You canâ€™t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, â€˜Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.â€™ He thinks heâ€™s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, â€˜Okay, okay, okay, okay. Â¿Habla espaÃ±ol, seÃ±or? Â¿Habla espaÃ±ol? Â¿Habla espaÃ±ol?â€™ SÃ­, sÃ­, sen-yours. SÃ­, sÃ­, sen-yours. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they â€˜re all like,â€™ Okay. â€˜Hmm. Good, good, good. Thatâ€™s good, good. Thatâ€™s good.â€™ And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fucking head until you see him go, â€˜Oh, fuck. â€˜Thereâ€™s no bibliotecain there. Whereâ€™s the ban-yo? I donâ€™t know any of those words.â€™ Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, Iâ€™m enjoying my plate of rice and â€˜polo,â€™ having a great timeâ€¦ enjoying my life.
I came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, â€˜What do you want to do about the last name?â€™ I was like, â€˜I donâ€™ t know. I mean, I donâ€™t really care. I donâ€™t think I really care.â€™ I was like, â€˜I mean, what do you want to do?â€™ Sheâ€™s like, â€˜Well, do you want me to take your last name?â€™ And thereâ€™s a part of you thatâ€™s like, â€˜No, man, itâ€™s cool.â€™ Then thereâ€™s a part of you thatâ€™s like, â€˜Yeah, you got to take the last name.â€™ Itâ€™s some male-ego bullshit, but thatâ€™s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesnâ€™t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I donâ€™t really know. We donâ€™t really know, you know. Last namesâ€¦ you used to give to somebody â€™cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, â€˜This will all be yours one day.â€™ That doesnâ€™t mean shit nowadays. I canâ€™t be like, â€˜Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.â€™ Who gives a shit, right? Thereâ€™s not much to it. You know, it really doesnâ€™t mean much.
But itâ€™s strange when I think about, like, white peopleâ€™s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guyâ€¦ Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But itâ€™s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynchâ€¦ â€˜Cause youâ€™re like, â€˜Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.â€™ Switch it up, dog.
But last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, â€˜What do you want to do?â€™ I said, â€˜How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?â€™ Right, whoseverâ€™s is cooler. She was like, â€˜Cooler?â€™ I was like, â€˜Yeah,â€™ â€™cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, â€˜Jordan, buckets.â€™ I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasnâ€™t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllablesâ€¦ San, unh, ti, got you, oh. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, â€˜Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?â€™ I said, â€˜Yeah.â€™ Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And sheâ€™s like, â€˜Whatâ€™s wrong with that?â€™ I was like, â€˜Whatâ€™ s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?â€™ Sheâ€™s like, â€˜Itâ€™s not that big of a deal.â€™ I said, â€˜Well, itâ€™s like part of the Third Reich.â€™ Iâ€™ll have to walk into restaurants, likeâ€¦ â€˜Weâ€™ re here for the Eichelberger party, â€˜the party of two. â€˜There is two of us at the party. â€˜We would like the table in the back of the room. â€˜In the back of the room, â€˜behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.â€™ Anyway, sheâ€™s a Santino now. Yeah.
We got into a thing, â€™cause I wasâ€¦ I feel like Iâ€™m watching too much porn lately, if Iâ€™m just being real with you guys. Weâ€™re getting real. Itâ€™s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. Itâ€™s a bad thing. Itâ€™s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think itâ€™s not my fault, though. I think itâ€™s accessâ€¦ access, too much access. In your pockets, thereâ€™s a phone, right? In there is all the pornoâ€¦ All of itâ€¦ all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would â€˜zorbâ€™ myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just goâ€¦ â€˜In the future, all the pornoâ€™s in your pocket,â€™. And get outâ€¦ and blow my mind. Justâ€¦ semen everywhere. Oh, my God. Iâ€™m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. Thatâ€™s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It really is too much access. Like, I canâ€™t walk past a laptop without being likeâ€¦ â€˜Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.â€™ The Blue Shirts, they donâ€™t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. Weâ€™ve seen so much of it. The problem isâ€¦ With porn is, itâ€™s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think youâ€™re like them. Youâ€™re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They justâ€¦ It takes off. Itâ€™s got loft. Are you kidding me? Iâ€™m lucky if mine comes out. Itâ€™s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it â€˜s like,â€™ No, no. Go back, go back.â€™ And when it does come out, itâ€™s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. Itâ€™s like, â€˜Sorry. Weâ€™re here.â€™ My wifeâ€¦ one night she was like, â€˜Oh, come on my tits.â€™ I was like, â€˜Oh, Iâ€™ll never make it up there.â€™ Itâ€™s so far. Itâ€™s too far. Maybe your belly button, maxâ€¦ if I really put in the work.
Iâ€™ll tell you what Iâ€™ve been watching a lot of. Iâ€™ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watchâ€¦ For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoesâ€¦ on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. Itâ€™s a bad thing. It really is. Itâ€™s a bad thing.
We need to clean up our minds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. Itâ€™s difficult, man. Itâ€™s difficult to do. People alwaysâ€¦ like, listen, I try to work out. Iâ€™m trying to be in shape. Iâ€™m trying to do all that stuff. Itâ€™s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. Youâ€™ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food jointâ€™s open, right? Youâ€™re like, â€˜You up, McDonaldâ€™s? You up?â€™ You send a late-night text, like, â€˜Whatâ€™ s up, girl? â€˜You up? Whatâ€™s up, McDonaldâ€™s? â€˜You up? Whatâ€™s up, Mac Dâ€™s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.â€™ Sheâ€™s like, â€˜Uh-huh.â€™ McDonaldâ€™s is like, â€˜You know it.â€™ You cruise over there, and on the way, youâ€™re like, â€˜Ooh, itâ€™ s gonna be good. â€˜I know what I get at this location. â€˜This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.â€™ Thatâ€™s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDieselâ€™s. Just like that, youâ€™re likeâ€¦ Devour it. And when youâ€™re done, you get in the car and cruise homeâ€¦ Same feeling. Cruising home, and youâ€™re likeâ€¦ â€˜Iâ€™m a bad person, man.â€™ Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. Iâ€™m trying to stay healthy. Iâ€™m trying to fit into my own skin. Thatâ€™s really what it is. You know, Iâ€™m trying to feel good about myself. Itâ€™s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, â€˜Hey, what the fuck?â€™
And I saidâ€¦
â€˜Thatâ€™ s my line. â€˜I say that. Thatâ€™s me. â€˜Iâ€™m doingâ€¦ Thatâ€™s what I do. You say, â€˜Iâ€™m sorry,â€™ I feel like.â€™ He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? Whatâ€™s up? On your face? I feel like thatâ€™s some, like, â€˜I donâ€™t give aâ€¦ â€˜Whatever, bro. Go ahead. Itâ€™s done. â€˜I donâ€™ t give a shit. â€˜Iâ€™ ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I â€˜ll cash out.â€™ On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had noâ€¦ I was backed up. I was like, â€˜Whatever, man.â€™ And in that moment, I was like, â€˜I canâ€™ t win this argument with this dude. I can â€˜t beat him physically.â€™ But I was like, â€˜If I had a superpower right now, â€˜you know, it wouldnâ€™ t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.â€™ Right? Heâ€™s all, â€˜Fuck you.â€™ Iâ€™m like, â€˜Fuck me? Fuck you, man.â€™ No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If youâ€™re not laughing at that, you didnâ€™t have acne when you were a kid. I had really bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. Iâ€™m like, â€˜What up, dude? Whatâ€™s the deal? â€˜Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.â€™ Here you are, 13, 14 years old. Youâ€™re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and youâ€™re like, â€˜Ooh, tough-looking kid.â€™ Youâ€™re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14.
Teenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. Theyâ€™re hard to see, bro. Theyâ€™re skinny. Their voices are crackling. Theyâ€™re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny likeâ€¦ Nasty-looking creaâ€¦ They look like Tim Burton cartoons. Theyâ€™re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And youâ€™re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, â€˜You know what? â€˜Iâ€™ m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.â€™ I didnâ€™t get it. I didnâ€™t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. â€˜I can die from this medication.â€™ Whatâ€™s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this mediâ€¦ I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. Iâ€™ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this isâ€¦ itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s better than your face. It doesnâ€™t really matter. Youâ€™re an ugly kid. Youâ€™re ugly. Itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, â€˜See you later, basketball.â€™ Ah, true story.
But I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and Iâ€™ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. Iâ€™m getting a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, â€˜Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.â€™ I go, â€˜Whatâ€™s up?â€™ Youâ€™re pretty good, man. Oh, thanks, man. He goes, â€˜For a white boy.â€™ And I was still like, â€˜Thank you. I appreciate that.â€™ Iâ€™ll take it. Then he goes, â€˜All right, man.â€™ I go, â€˜All right, man.â€™ He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stopsâ€¦ real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, â€˜Hey, yo, white boy.â€™ I say, â€˜Whatâ€™s up, man? What up?â€™ He goes, â€˜What the fuck is all over your face?â€™ That still hurts today. Iâ€™m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, â€˜Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.â€™ No, I didnâ€™t say that. Thatâ€™s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man.
But I always loved black people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think theyâ€™re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people donâ€™t like redheads for some reason. Thereâ€™s this thing. White people see redheads, and theyâ€™re like, â€˜What do we do with it?â€™ They donâ€™t like us. They donâ€™t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us namesâ€¦ â€˜You fire crotch, you ginger.â€™ They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guyâ€™s never said that to me. White guysâ€¦ â€˜The carpet match the drapes, bud?â€™ And Iâ€™m always like, â€˜Are you a grown-up asking â€˜about my penis hair? â€˜Is that the level that youâ€™re on? â€˜Youâ€™ re worried about my penis hair, dude. â€˜If you must know, itâ€™s hardwood floors. There â€˜s no carpet there, bro.â€™ I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s working overtime under there. Thatâ€™s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, likeâ€¦ I canâ€™t, I canâ€™t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. Thatâ€™s a reality check. Now people are like, â€˜Huh? What are you talking about?â€™ White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. Weâ€™re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. Iâ€™m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people donâ€™t adopt that dog, but black people are like, â€˜No, no, no. â€˜He good, he good, he good. â€˜He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. â€˜He gonna be fine. Tripod. â€˜Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.â€™ Thatâ€™s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the â€™90s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a â€˜wigger.â€™ Do you remember that word? Donâ€™t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I donâ€™t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You shouldâ€™ve stuck around for a while. People used to call me a â€˜wigger.â€™ People used to say â€˜wiggerâ€™ to me â€™cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And Iâ€™ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team saysâ€¦ â€˜Whatever, bro. That dude ainâ€™t nothing but a wigger.â€™ And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were likeâ€¦ Thatâ€™s how they sound, like a train. They were likeâ€¦ When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, justâ€¦ Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out â€™cause that was an attack, you know. They didnâ€™t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, â€™cause they were like, â€˜That white dude ainâ€™t nothing but a wigger.â€™ And I heard it, and I was like, â€˜Ohâ€¦ so close.â€™ How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if youâ€™re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. Thatâ€™s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell youâ€¦ Every time I talk to my black guy friends, Iâ€™m always like, â€˜Hey, man, donâ€™t date white girls.â€™ Donâ€™t date white girls. Not â€™cause Iâ€™m racist. Iâ€™m clearly not racist. I have black friends. Iâ€™m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls â€™cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. Thatâ€™s it. We donâ€™t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquandaâ€¦ Thatâ€™s how weâ€™re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while heâ€™s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drakeâ€™s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. Whatâ€™s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. Weâ€™re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. Youâ€™re it. Tag, youâ€™re it. Youâ€™re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called â€˜Hit â€˜Em Upâ€™â€¦ Before he started the lyrics, he goes, â€˜So I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.â€™ Thatâ€™s what he said. Youâ€™re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, letâ€™s go. Here we go. Thatâ€™s crazy. Thatâ€™s how much he hated that guy. Thatâ€™s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. Itâ€™s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I blame one person for the death of hip-hop. His name is Macklemore. That dude is the worst. That dude is the worst. Macklemore is at fault for all this shit going south. Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but heâ€™s not hip-hop, okay? Thatâ€™s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? Youâ€™re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? Thatâ€™s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesnâ€™t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesnâ€™t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Donâ€™t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I donâ€™t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be likeâ€¦ And Iâ€™m like, â€˜You got it, you got it.â€™ Thatâ€™s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be likeâ€¦ Thatâ€™s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. Whatâ€™s wrong with you, bro? This guyâ€™s bullshit. We canâ€™t call him hip-hop. Itâ€™s crazy that heâ€™s hip-hop, â€™cause itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me the most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called â€˜Same Love.â€™ It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song Iâ€™m not against. Iâ€™m for same-sex marriage. I donâ€™t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You donâ€™t fuck kids or animals, I donâ€™t care. Thatâ€™s it for me. No kids, no animals, weâ€™re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just donâ€™t return that. I donâ€™t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song Iâ€™m okay with. Itâ€™s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, â€˜When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.â€™ Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. Thatâ€™s what he said. I thought I was one of you fellas. Thank God Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that â€™cause they applauded him. They were like, â€˜Oh, how bold. â€˜How brave of Macklemore. â€˜He thought he was a homosexual. â€˜In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. â€˜Heâ€™ s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.â€™ And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to sayâ€¦ â€˜I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.â€™ I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, â€˜Hey, fellas.â€™ I would fag out all day. Likeâ€¦ I was homosexual, bro. It wasnâ€™t a question. It was a fact. That kidâ€™s gay as shit. Little redhead gay kid skating backwards. I was gay, man. I was gay when I was in third grade. You were all gay in third grade. I would beg my mom to let me sleep at other boysâ€™ houses every night of the week. I want to sleep at Billyâ€™s. What are you doing over there? None of your business, Mom! Make the call, please! I was so gay in third grade. If another boy accused me of liking girls, Iâ€™d fucking murder that kid. Chicago, Illinois, I got to go. Iâ€™m Andrew Santino. Thank you so much, man. Thank you, guys. I love you, Chicago. Everybody whoâ€™s anybody has lived in this building, man. Locals, babyâ€¦ Jordan, Pippen, Longley, Kerr, Paxton. You know it, dude. Ryne Sandberg used to own and live in one of those big white poles at the top. He would have to slide down for breakfast. Al Capone still lives in the basement. Not dead. Itâ€™s now called Willis, used to be called Macyâ€™s Tower, after the Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day Parade, because most of the floats are made right here in this building. Itâ€™s actually anatomically to scaleâ€¦ even his balls. The penis is not. They ran out of clay, but the balls are full. And if you look right beyond me, thatâ€™s the Adams Street Bridge, named, of course, after the Addams Family. Duh-na-na-na. Oh, you want a fat dick in a bun or a little dick in a bun? I donâ€™t want any penises on the hot dog, just a regular hot dog. Okay, weâ€™re gonna give you a Trump dog, then.
Gonna give me a Trump dog?
Damn right. You know what? Let me tell you something. Youâ€™re not nice, and youâ€™re not nice to people andâ€¦ We donâ€™t give a fuck about your fucking soft ass. Yes. Iâ€™m sick of this abuse. All I want isâ€¦ Save that pussy-ass shit for somebody else that want to fucking hear it.
Good night, pussy lips.
Right.
Fine, good night.
Bye, dick cheese. Get the fuck out of here.
Iâ€™m leaving.
Pussy nose. Well, leave. Tweet, tweety bird. Hey, Andrew, I think the crewâ€™s gonna head out of here. Cool, man. Get out.
Weâ€™re wrapped.
Yeah, Iâ€™m here. Do you need a ride, or are you good? I get in myâ€¦ I can walk.
Okay.
Cool. Good luck with your special or tour guide, whatever this is. Thanks, dude. Thank you, Bernard.

Thank you.
[indistinct yelling]
Thank you. That was very nice.
[indistinct yelling]
Nice, itâ€™s good to be here. Itâ€™s good to be down here in Virginia.
[audience chuckles]
Down here in Virginia. Virginiaâ€™s alright. I like it down here. Itâ€™s nice. Yeah, itâ€™s alright. We traveled a lot for this. We went to Australia this year. It was alright.
[audience chuckles]
Anytime I go to another country, as I get out of the airport, and start driving around, Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
[chuckles] â€œDude. This is your fucking country, dude?â€
Other countries suck. Americaâ€™s number one. Itâ€™s not, likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s not even close.
[crowd cheering]
Itâ€™s official.
Iâ€™ve been to, like, three other countries. Itâ€™s official.
[audience laughs]
And the other countries hate it too. They hate that weâ€™re number one. You ever tell them? You ever go to another country and tell â€™em weâ€™re number one?Swim up to, like, a pool bar and justâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€œDid you know weâ€™re number one?â€
They hate it. They try to bring up bullshit to bring us down.
â€œWhat about all the mass shootings you guys have all the time?â€
I say, â€œAt least weâ€™re not gay.â€
[all laughing]
You know?
Thereâ€™s really not a good comeback to that, â€™causeâ€¦ itâ€™s a pretty serious problem. And weâ€™re the only country doing that. Weâ€™re not making any adjustments.
[audience laughs]
â€œNone. What, weâ€™re gonna give up our guns like a bunch of fucking gay guys?â€
[audience laughs]
â€œYeah, right, dude.â€
â€œNo, weâ€™re just gonna have shootings all the time.â€
â€œYeah!â€
No, Australiaâ€™s good. I was shittinâ€™ on it. Australiaâ€¦ Australia might be number two. Thatâ€™s a good country, dude. Just a whole country doing nothing. Thatâ€™s what I like about â€™em. Theyâ€™re just down there, zero exports. Creating nothing, dude. The only export Iâ€™ve seen come out of Australia is just that YouTube video of that guy punching that kangaroo in the face.
[all laughing]
You know that video? That kangaroo holding that dog hostage out in the woods.
[audience laughs]
Owner shows up, squares up with the kangaroo.
[chuckles]
No hesitatâ€¦ Kangaroo knew it was a fight too.
[audience laughs]
Guy just walks upâ€¦ Bam! If youâ€™ve seen the video, you know how good that impression is.
[audience applauds, cheers]
[laughing]
Yes!
Australia gave us that. Australia also gave us Love on the Spectrum.
[audience cheering]
Love on the Spectrum. Thank you, Australia.
Incredible show. Truly an incredibleâ€¦ Actually, an incredibleâ€¦ How did this show get made?
[audience laughs]
Thatâ€™s an insane show.
Only Australia could have come up with this.
Only Australians would be likeâ€¦ [in Australian accent] â€œAlright.â€
â€œKnow how autistic people are extremely uncomfortable in social settings.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œStick a camera in these fuckinâ€™ retardsâ€™ face and watch â€™em talk.â€
[audience laughs]
No, dude.
Donâ€™t do that.
Weâ€™re all gonna watch it, but donâ€™t do that.
[audience laughs]
â€œLook at him trying to fuck.â€
[chuckles]
No, Australia ruled. I onlyâ€¦
I only had one negative experience while I was there and it was, uhâ€¦ I gotâ€¦ I got bullied. I got made fun of publicly by a goth. They still have goths, dude. Full-on. Black trench coat, black eyeliner. And they made fun of me. Iâ€™ll give him credit, in his defense, the reason he was making fun of me was â€™cause I was wearing a bucket hat.
[audience chuckles]
I had never done that before.
There were no Black people on the island, I was taking fashion chances all the time.
Thatâ€™s the thing about these countries, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia.
No Black people.
And I know what youâ€™re thinking.
Nah. [laughs]
[audience laughs]
No, you need Black people to keep the whites in check.
The last thing you want is a whole island of whites that think theyâ€™re the coolest people on earth.
A disaster. Thatâ€™s how you end up with Conor McGregors walking around.
â€œBlah blah blah blah.â€
Itâ€™s like, â€œShut up, dude.â€
The foreign whites are out of control.
[all laughing]
American whites, weâ€™re humble.
[audience laughs]
We know weâ€™re not the coolest guys around.
Itâ€™s the foreign whites, dude.
[audience member] Yeah!
Yeah. [chuckles]
â€œYes!â€ [laughs]
â€œPreach, brother!â€ [laughs]
[audience laughs]
For real, though.
Thereâ€™s a reason every good NBA player thatâ€™s white is from another country.
The audacity to think you can play in that league, dude.
The fucking arrogance.
Every white dude in America saw a Black kid dunking like, in eight grade, and it was just, like, â€œOh, alright.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œThere goes that dream.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œIâ€™ll just set picks for the next four years.â€
[chuckles]
Just box out hard as hell.
White people used to be cool in America.
[audience laughs]
Long time ago, dude.
The heightâ€¦ The height of white people being cool was us goingâ€¦
[in Transatlantic accent] â€œMeh.â€
That was as cool as we got. Like, â€œMah, see? Ha-ha. Wah.â€
[speaking normally] And then the day white people stopped being cool was Jackie Robinsonâ€™s first game.
[audience laughs]
You can look it up, dude.
You can find it, you can find the radio call from that game online.
You can hear the exact moment white people stopped being cool.
You can hear the announcers, they goâ€¦
[in Transatlantic accent] â€œMah. Chicago, with the White Sox, take on the Brooklyn Dodgers.â€
[speaking normally] We all had cool, white nicknames.
[in Transatlantic accent] â€œUp at the mound is Olâ€™ Curly.â€
â€œHeâ€™s a 47-year-old alcoholic. Heâ€™s the greatest athlete alive.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œRuns a six-second, 40-yard dash.â€
â€œFastest man alive, they say.â€
[speaking normally] Then it happened, dude. Then Jackie came up to the plate, you can hear the announcers were like, â€œMeh.â€
[all laughing]
â€œComing on to the plate is a young colored boy, from Brooklyn.â€
â€œNo way he can hit Curlyâ€™s pitch.â€
â€œHere comes the pitch! Fuck, home run.â€
[audience laughs]
That was it, dude.
Jackie hit the ball so hard he knocked that voice out of all the whites.
Not one of us has talked like that since.
It was one swing of the bat, and weâ€™re like, â€œMeh!â€
[clears throat] â€œAll right, yeah, that was pretty good. That was good.â€
â€œThat was good, itâ€™s time for us to focus on computers.â€
[audience laughs]
[chuckles]
Anyway.
I was in Australia.
I was in a bucket hat.
I was already self-conscious about the bucket hat.
Tried it on in the hotel.
Just looked like fucking John Candy.
It wasâ€¦
[all laughing]
I was with my friend, heâ€™s a good friend, â€œI look like a fucking dumbass, right?â€
He was like, â€œNo, dude, you look cool.â€
â€œWho cares? No oneâ€™s gonna give a fuck.â€ I was like, â€œAlright, fine.â€
As soon as we got outside of the hotel, somebody gave a fuck.
I got made fun of immedâ€¦ It was the goth.
The goth. I didnâ€™t even see him coming. He came out of the shadows, like they do.
[hissing]
[chuckles]
This fucking guy. I was standing talking to my friend.
He was walking behind us on the sidewalk.
He walked behind me, took my hat off my head, put it back down and patted me on the head.
I turned around, smiling at him.
â€˜Cause I thought, â€œOnly a friend could have done this.â€
This guy kept walking. He didnâ€™t even break stride.
He goes, â€œNice hat, fatso!â€
[audience laughs]
Destroyed me for noâ€¦ I had no comeback.
I was just like, â€œYeah, right!â€
[audience laughs]
I was like that fucking kangaroo.
[audience laughs]
â€œWhat was that about?â€
That was six months ago. Iâ€™ve thought about that guy every day.
Every day. I hate him.
I hate everythingâ€¦ I hate that heâ€™s a goth from Australia.
Itâ€™s like, you canâ€™t be that. You canâ€™t be a goth from Australia.
You sound funny.
You canâ€™tâ€¦ Know what I mean? That guy canâ€™t go around likeâ€¦ [in Australian accent] â€œAll day I think about death.â€
[audience laughs]
[speaking normally] â€œShut up, dude.â€
[in Australian accent] â€œIâ€™m very dark and twisted.â€
[audience laughs]
[speaking normally] No, youâ€™re not.
Youâ€™re Australian, you sound funny.
Australian accent is one of those accents thatâ€™s funnyâ€¦ every single time.
You could be in the middle of a fucking tragedy, if you heard an Australian accent, youâ€™d still be likeâ€¦ [chuckles]
[audience laughs]
You know what I mean?
Like, if there was, like, an Australian guy in the office on 9/11â€¦ [in Australian accent] â€œOh, fuck, look out!â€ Likeâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€œOh no, thereâ€™s another one. Get down!â€
[audience laughs]
â€œOh, fuck, itâ€™s hot up here. Gonna have to jump out!â€
[audience laughs]
â€œNo!â€
[audience laughs]
[grunts affirmatively]
[audience cheering]
[speaking normally] Oh, a 9/11 joke. That was great, bravo!
[chuckles]
Alright.
Iâ€™ll tell you this, on a more serious note.
This is something Iâ€™m dealing with in my life.
I just recently found out that the girl Iâ€™m dating, her ex is a Navy SEAL.
[audience chuckling]
That sucks.
[audience laughs]
That sucks dick, dude. Thatâ€™s the worst sex of all time. I never even thought ofâ€¦ You wanna feel insecure as a man? Thatâ€™s the worâ€¦ I neverâ€¦ never even thought of that one, as like, â€œThat could happen to me.â€ I spent my whole life thinking, â€œBlack guy, worst case on thisâ€¦â€
[all laughing]
And by the way, I mean that with all due respect to the Black community, dude. For real, I wish people feared my dick like that.
[audience laughs]
I wish my dick struck fear into entire races. Nobody fears my dick, dude.
[audience laughs]
Nobody fears my dick. Other than, like, women in parking garages, theyâ€¦
[all laughing]
Get me in a parking garage, all of a sudden my dickâ€™s top of the food chain. See me lurking behind a pillar in there, justâ€¦
[audience laughs]
With a GameStop bag. Justâ€¦
[audience laughs]
Naw, dude, Navy SEAL. Itâ€™s a tough one.
I do this thing, itâ€™s not a good thing, but wheneverâ€¦ whenever Iâ€™m dating a girl, I always talk shit on their exes. Itâ€™s not a good look. Women donâ€™t respect it. Kinda makes me look like a bitch. I like it. I perâ€¦
[all laughing]
I canâ€™t stop doing it. And normally itâ€™s easy. Normally itâ€™s like, â€œWhat does your ex do? Heâ€™s a fucking substitute teacher? Itâ€™s weird he wants to hang out with kids, like, that bad?â€ You know?
[audience laughs]
This oneâ€™s tough. Heâ€™s a tough ex to make fun of. Iâ€™m walking around the apartment all day, just, â€œPfft! Fucking Navy SEALsâ€¦â€
[audience laughs]
Theyâ€™re kind of pussies if you really think about it. You know what I mean? Like, using night vision, sneaking up on guysâ€¦ Thatâ€™s a fucking cowardâ€™s way to fight, dude.
[audience laughs]
You know whoâ€™s actually brave? Al-Qaeda.
Yeah.
[audience laughs]
That takes courage and bravery. With their pajamas, throwing rocks at tanks. Heroic shit, dude, just you and your boys going out. [laughing] In flip-flops. Youâ€™re all gonna get fucked up, dude.
[audience laughs]
No training. Zero military training, dude. Those guysâ€¦ Those dudes had fuckinâ€™â€¦ They had one set of monkey bars. Thatâ€™s what they all trained on.
[all laughing]
And they were proud of the monkey bars. You remember that video? Youâ€™ve seen them using the monkey bars. They were prâ€¦ Theyâ€¦ They filmed themselves using the monkey bars, and then sent that tape out to the world, likeâ€¦ â€œNot bad.â€
[all laughing]
[chuckles]
A buddy of mine watches like, uhâ€¦ like death videos on the internet.
[chuckles]
I donâ€™t. He watches them.
If weâ€™re hanging out, Iâ€™ll watchâ€¦ We watchâ€¦ I watchâ€¦
I was at his place, watchâ€¦ I donâ€™t know if you know this, the war in the Middle East is just on the internet.
The whole fuckingâ€¦ Every dude out there on both sides was wearing GoPros the entire time. Like, you can watch itâ€¦ We watched, like, three hours of the war in Iraq. After the first hour, I found myself starting to cheerâ€¦ Not cheer, but, likeâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦relate. I felt like I could relate more to the monkey bars guys. They were a little more my speed. Ever wonder how you would do out there? Watch those guys. Those are just normal fuckinâ€™ dudes. The second shots are fired, thereâ€™s no game plan, theyâ€™re just, â€œOh, shit!â€
[audience laughs]
Very relatable. Guns jamming. Trying to fire a rocket. It goes straight fucking backwards.
[audience laughs]
They look like me trying to fire a gun, their feet move when they shoot.
[audience laughs]
Very relatable.
They also have never won. They neâ€¦ They got fucked up every single time.
Bad. They would blow up like one truck every five months. Theyâ€™d be just as surprised as everybody that shit finally worked out. You can hear it in their voice. Something blows up, theyâ€™d be like, â€œOh!â€
[yelling, chuckles]
Yeah, dude, thatâ€™s a human reaction. Thatâ€™s relatable.
Thatâ€™s what I would do if I saw a fucking explosion. Iâ€™d go, â€œOh!â€
[audience laughs]
Thatâ€™s human. You ever watch us kill people? I canâ€™t relate to that at all.
Thereâ€™s some Black Hawk helicopter with night vision mows down, like, 40 people. Pilot gets on, he just goesâ€¦
[mimics radio chatter] â€œClear.â€
[audience laughs]
Just flies away? Itâ€™s like, â€œYo, thatâ€™s a psycho. That guy didnâ€™t give a fuck about that.â€
At least ISIS is down there having fun, dancing afterwards.
[audience laughs]
You know? Itâ€™s like Ewok village down there, dude.
[audience laughs]
Also, Iâ€™m notâ€¦ Iâ€™m not actually pro-ISIS.
[audience laughs]
Alright? Itâ€™s justâ€¦ A Navy SEAL did fuck my girlfriend.
[audience laughs]
And I am having a pretty tough time dealing with that. It sucks, dude. Canâ€™t get it out of my head. Some fucking cool, jacked heroâ€¦ just getting tactical on my sweet babyâ€™s pussy.
[audience laughs]
Just clearing out every corner of my sweet angelâ€™s box. Just checking behind every door in there. Just, â€œClear, go, red team, advance.â€
[audience laughs]
Now, Iâ€™m in there, fuckingâ€¦ [hollers]
[audience laughs]
I know weâ€™re laughing, having a good time, but that does suck. That sucks. That absolutely sucks. Sexuallyâ€¦ Sexually I have toâ€¦ I have to follow a fucking Navy SEAL? They never quit until the jobâ€™s done, dude, thatâ€™s their whole thing. I quit. A lot. Alright? The jobâ€™s done when Iâ€™m tired, which is usually pretty early into the mission.
[audience laughs]
My arms start shaking pretty early. They give out. Next thing you know, weâ€™re having belly-to-belly missionary.
[audience laughs]
Just hunched over, breathing in her ear like a pug for five minutes.
[breathing heavily]
[coughs]
Just coughing.
Coughing during sex is funny.
[coughs]
[audience laughs]
You guys know belly-to-belly missionary, dude, donâ€™t fuckinâ€™â€¦
I saw this crowd, dude.
I see you, boyâ€¦ Lot of belly-to-belly tonight, dude.
This guyâ€™s hunched over. Justâ€¦
[exhales]
You donâ€™t even think about that noise youâ€™re making in that poor womanâ€™s ear. Every woman in this room has heard that noise.
Youâ€™ve neverâ€¦ The only way I can describe it is, you ever lay down, and the dog starts sniffing in your ear?
[audience laughs]
Thatâ€™s what it sounds likeâ€¦
[mimics dog sniffing]
[audience laughs]
[moans, grunts]
[chuckles]
No, my girlfriend and I, we have sex and itâ€™s fine. Itâ€™s okay.
One thing thatâ€™s funny about it is, itâ€™s a new enough relationship that my girlfriend is still loud during sex.
You remember that? You remember that phase?
Still new enough in the relationship that my girlfriend, like, screams every time we have sex. Iâ€™m just up there, like, â€œYeah, right!â€
[audience laughs]
â€œYeah, right, lady. Iâ€™ve seen women walk through this, no problem.â€
I mean, itâ€™s nice, itâ€™s a nice gesture. And sometimes it tricks me, Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œYeah, maybe itâ€™s not gonna fit.â€
[audience laughs]
No, itâ€™s gonna fit.
Itâ€™s gonna fit. Itâ€™s gonna fall out a couple times.
[audience laughs]
No, the screaming phase is about done.
We moved in together, so thatâ€™s when that ends.
Once youâ€¦ Before you live together, sex is like, â€œYeah, fuck me, meh.â€
Once you move in together, sex slowly becomes just, some lady laying on a bed next to a pile of unfolded laundry, justâ€¦
[inhales rhythmically]
â€œOw, youâ€™re on my hair!â€
[audience laughs]
No, we live together now. My girlfriend moved in with me, so we have sex and, uhâ€¦ As soon as weâ€™re done having sex, I wish that she would fucking evaporate.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™m frightened. [chuckling]
No, who would know? You guys are right, I hate playing Xbox by myself, dude.
[audience laughs]
What the fuck?
[sarcastically] I love having her around all the time.
Fucking turning on lights. Asking me to hang out.
â€œNo.â€
[audience laughs]
No, we hang out. Iâ€™m just not used to it. Iâ€™m not used toâ€¦ Iâ€™m not used to hanging out with a woman all the time. Iâ€™m not used to hanging out with women. I donâ€™t have any female friends. Iâ€™m more of a having-a-good-time type of guy. You know?
[audience laughs]
I donâ€™t even know what women do for fun. Fucking fold shit, or something like that?
[audience laughs]
Huh? [chuckles]
Look, I know thatâ€™s not the best joke of all time.
From your seats, thatâ€™s not the most well-crafted joke.
â€œWhat do women do? Fold shit?â€
But from up here, from up here, itâ€™s a very, very funny joke.
I get to say something as dumb as, â€œWhat do women do? Fold shit?â€
And look out and see about 15 different women goingâ€¦
[audience laughs]
[laughs]
I understand, most of the women here are girlfriends that were dragged to this show, that already donâ€™t like me â€™cause every time theyâ€™re in their car, their boyfriends are like, â€œListen to this part of the podcast.â€
[audience laughs]
Yeah.
[audience cheers]
Iâ€™m aware.
[audience cheering]
And nowâ€¦ And now those women are here, and the show is going exactly how they knew it was gonna go.
Some dumb ogre on stage like, â€œWomen are dumb, ah!â€
So, no, I appreciate it. I appreciate you.
Sweet angels.
I found this out from hanging out with my girlfriend, uhâ€¦ I didnâ€™t know that womenâ€¦ women watch porn now.
[audience member] Whoo!
Shame! Whatâ€™s that? [laughs]
[audience laughs]
No, Iâ€™m sorry.
Iâ€™ll say this about that.
I think women watching porn is having a negative effect on all of us.
You know what I mean? We canâ€™t both come into the bedroom thinking we can fuck like that.
Have you fucked someone lately? Everyone thinks theyâ€™re in a porn, dude.
Every time you fuck a lady, sheâ€™s allâ€¦ [makes guttural noises]
Every dudeâ€™s likeâ€¦ [makes dumb noises]
Everyoneâ€¦ What are we doing? Stop.
Belly-to-belly is pretty good. It feels the same.
[audience laughs]
Everyone thinks theyâ€™re a porn star. Youâ€™re not, dude, those are professionals.
Youâ€™re not good enough to fuck like that.
First off, if youâ€™re a dude and youâ€™re good at sex, thatâ€™s gay.
[audience laughs]
I hate to break it to you, dude, thatâ€™s a girl quality.
Now, Iâ€™m notâ€¦ Iâ€™m not sayinâ€™ itâ€™s bad.
Iâ€™m saying it was bad enough already when it was just men watching porn, coming into the bedroom with fucking ideas.
From shitâ€¦ Know what I mean?
It was bad enough when it was just me, coming in there, justâ€¦
[grunts]
[audience laughs]
[straining] â€œI watched a squirt tutorial earlier.â€
[audience laughs]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œI canâ€™t squirt.â€ Like, â€œYou all can squirt, actually.â€
Some girl just forces herself to pee to get you to stop doing it.
Itâ€™s like, â€œYou did it, baby.â€ â€œYeah, obviously I did it.â€
Yeah, you canâ€™t do the cool moves you see in porn. Just have regularâ€¦
Just do regular. You donâ€™t have toâ€¦
You ever try â€™em? You ever think you can?
You ever try to, like, cum in a girlâ€™s face?
Not as coolâ€¦ Theyâ€™re a lot less receptive in real life.
Thatâ€™sâ€¦ That whole process is a fucking nightmare, dude.
Itâ€™s a disaster.
Itâ€™s just you, the girl you love is down thereâ€¦
Youâ€™ve been begging her for three months to try this.
Finally sheâ€™s like, â€œYeah, you can do it.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œYes!â€
â€œItâ€™ll be just like the videos I watch every day, thatâ€™s my favorite partâ€¦â€
Now you get to do it. You think itâ€™s gonna be awesome.
Itâ€™s not.
Itâ€™s just you up there, alone.
Itâ€™s coldâ€¦
[coughing]
[laughs]
Sheâ€™s atâ€¦ Sheâ€™s being nice. Sheâ€™s like, â€œAre you okay?â€
Now you can feel it. â€œAlright, here it comes.â€
â€œThis is gonna be awesome. Sheâ€™s gonna love this.â€
As soon as it hits herâ€¦
[audience laughs]
They freeze.
And then once itâ€™s on â€™em, they, like, donâ€™t know how to move.
Know what I mean? Like, you ever put socks on a cat?
[audience laughs]
You feel bad â€™cause the cumâ€™s out of you and you realize what youâ€™ve done.
You feel terrible, youâ€™ve got a fuckingâ€¦ You gotta pick her up off the ground.
I feel like, the same energy as when a toddler falls, like, â€œCome here, get up, youâ€™re all right.â€
â€œYouâ€™re all right!â€
[scattered applause]
Weâ€™ll never do it again.
[audience cheering]
[laughs]
Yes.
Alright, enough of this cum talk.
Iâ€™ll tell you. This was making me laugh. I was on, uhâ€¦ I was on Twitter and I saw a picture of this guy, and he wasâ€¦ he was retiring from the military, and when he retired, he posted a picture of himself, full military uniform, all of his medals, but he was wearing a, uh, furry mask, like a sexual dog mask.
[man] Yeah!
And he posted it, â€œNow that Iâ€™m retiring from the military, I can come out and say Iâ€™ve been into puppy play this entire time.â€
And he tweeted it, he said, â€œOfficer Bow-wow out.â€
He saidâ€¦ He said like, â€œ#servicedog.â€
It was rough.
[laughs]
[audience laughs]
For real, that was on X. [laughs]
But he tweeted it, so of course, Russia and Chinaâ€™s Twitter, they got ahold of it, they started talking shit.
They were like, â€œLook at our military, a bunch of jacked, skinhead dudes.â€
â€œThen look at Americaâ€™s military, thereâ€™s, like, transgender people, the dog generalâ€¦â€
[audience laughs]
Theyâ€™re making fun of us. Making memes.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œLook how tough and masculine our army is.â€
â€œLook how weak and gay America is.â€
But I was looking at the pictures and I was likeâ€¦
â€œDog general is the scariest soldier Iâ€™ve ever fuckingâ€¦â€
Iâ€™ve never imagined in myâ€¦ Dude, just some sexual freak, operating drones, that thinks heâ€™s a fucking dog? Justâ€¦
[howling]
[laughing] Whoa.
You know how fucking scary that guy is?
Deleting villages.
[howling]
[laughs]
That guyâ€™s terrifying.
The gayer the army, the scarier. Forever, dude, throughout history.
Think of any army throughout history, imagine them gay.
[audience member] Nazis!
Gay Nazis?
Just when you thought those guys couldnâ€™t look any sharper, theyâ€¦
[audience laughs]
Gay Vikings?
Gay Vikings, dude.
Youâ€™re just some villager, looking out on the shoreline.
See a bunch of Viking longships coming.
Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, no.â€
â€œItâ€™s the Vikings.â€
â€œTheyâ€™re gonna rape our wives and daughters.â€
Then they pull up their fucking rainbow flag on their boat, and theyâ€™re just likeâ€¦
â€œOh, fuck!â€
[laughs]
[audience laughs]
â€œOh, thatâ€™s way worse!â€
[Shane chuckles]
I like history. [chuckles]
Iâ€™m a bit of a history buff.
Which, by the way, that is early onset Republican.
Thatâ€™s veryâ€¦ Itâ€™s a very serious warning sign.
If youâ€™re a white dude in your 20s and 30s and youâ€™re like, â€œI canâ€™t stop reading about World War II,â€ itâ€™s coming, brother, you mightâ€¦
[audience laughs]
You might not be Republican right now. You might be young, cool and liberal.
Might think youâ€™re safe. Dude, youâ€™re not.
It doesnâ€™t happen overnight, it takes time.
It takesâ€¦ You think your dad wanted to be Republican?
That he got out of high school and like, â€œTime to be a prick about everything.â€
[audience laughs]
No, dude, it takes time.
Iâ€™m not a Republican right now, but I can feel it. It grows.
â€œUgh.â€ Iâ€™ve gotta fight it. Every day. Like a fucking werewolf.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™ll just be watching TV, out of nowhereâ€¦
â€œAh, why are Black guys in every commercial?â€
[audience laughs]
â€œMermaids are white!â€
[audience laughs]
â€œIâ€™m 35, thatâ€™s important to me!â€
[laughs]
They are white, andâ€¦
[all laughing]
Iâ€™m not joking on that one. [laughs]
No, I like history, so itâ€™s coming.
Iâ€™m not a Republican now, but itâ€™s coming. Thereâ€™s noâ€¦
When Iâ€™m on the roadâ€¦ I travel every fucking weekend, thereâ€™s nothing to do during the day. At night you do standup. During the day, I travel every weekend. Sometimes I like to visit, like, historical places throughout the country.
[man chuckles]
A couple summers agoâ€¦ Donâ€™t laugh at that.
[audience laughs]
Shut up, dude, itâ€™s not lame at all.
[audience laughs]
What the fuckâ€¦ Guy just laughed at me from the balconyâ€¦
â€œHa-ha-ha-ha!â€
â€œDork!â€ [chuckles]
So, a couple of summers ago, I was in Washington DC, and I went and I visited, uh, Mount Vernon. I went and I visited George Washingtonâ€™s house. Uh, turns out, it was George Washingtonâ€™s plantation.
[audience laughs]
â€œAh! Shucks!â€
[giggles]
I getâ€¦ Iâ€™m the only one there. It was the first summer during COVID, Iâ€™m the only visitor there. Itâ€™s meâ€¦ And if youâ€™ve been there before, itâ€™s 15 reenactors that donâ€™t break character. They stayâ€¦ Everyone else was in the 1700s. I was the only guy there. Like, I signed up for the tour, and my tour guide was Martha Washington. It wasnâ€™t her, it was some fat bitch.
[audience laughs]
I saw right through it. I signed up for the tour, so me and Martha have to hang out together for 15 minutes to see if anybody else signs up for, like, the three oâ€™clock tour or whatever. Of course they donâ€™t.
I gotta make small talk with a woman that wonâ€™t stop pretending to be from the 1700s. Itâ€™s fucking insane. What do you say? I was just out there with her like, â€œWhereâ€™s George Washington?â€
[audience laughs]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, the General?â€ He wonâ€™t be joining us today. Heâ€™s in his chambers, itâ€™s just you and I.â€
I was likeâ€¦
â€œWhat, are youâ€¦â€ [laughs]
[audience laughs]
â€œYou tryinâ€™ to fuck meâ€¦?â€
[audience laughs]
Never brokeâ€¦ No one broke chaâ€¦ Iâ€¦
Enough timeâ€™s gone by, Iâ€™ve had enough to think about why nobody would break character while I was there. And for real, Iâ€™m certain they thought I was a special needs man.
[audience laughs]
Like, they all got together and were like, â€œItâ€™s obviously a big day for this guy. Nobody break character, letâ€™s make it magic for him.â€
Like, they watched me park my car when I got there. And when I got out they were like, â€œOh.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œOne of the driving ones. Look at him.â€
[audience laughs]
It was also during COVID and the mask did not do me any favors. You can always see my eyes, I got the eyes for it. It was sunny outâ€¦
[audience laughs]
It alsoâ€¦ It also didnâ€™t help I walked up to my tour guide like, â€œWhereâ€™s George Washington?â€
[audience laughs]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, youâ€™re a big guy!â€ I was like, â€œYeahâ€¦â€
[chuckles]
So, me and Marthaâ€¦ Me and Martha go in for the tour. Due to COVID restrictions at the time, we were not allowed to speak indoors.
All right? So for $36, me and a woman dressed like Martha Washington fucking dead silently walked throughâ€¦ For a full hour.
You need to be able to talk for this tour to have any value at all.
Thereâ€™s nothing to read in there, itâ€™s just old chairs and shit.
Me and this lady went room to room for an hour and this was the tour.
[audience laughs]
I was in the corner of every room, justâ€¦ â€œIâ€™m not gettinâ€™ it.â€
We get outside and sheâ€™s like, â€œDo you have any questions?â€
â€œYeah, what the fuck was that? What was that?â€
â€œWhatâ€™d you and me just do?â€
So that was the end of me and Martha. I go off by myself.
I started looking around.
Like I said, it was the first summer during COVID.
Alright? So weâ€™re in the middle, you know,
weâ€™re in the middle of tearing-down-statue season.
And I was at the Founding Fathersâ€™ plantation during all of that.
So I wanted to check out the slave quarters.
Wanted to see what all the fuss was!
[audience laughs]
Uh-huh! No, whatever. Fuck you, guys. Whatâ€™d you guys do?
[audience laughs]
Whatâ€™d you guys do that summer?
Fuckinâ€™ post black squares on your Instagram?
Is that what you did?
[audience cheering]
How dare you judge me?
How dareâ€¦ I was there.
Boots on the ground at a Founding Fathersâ€™ plantation.
Growing. Learning as a whiteâ€¦ Becomingâ€¦
[all laughing]
For real, though, I was in there, in George Washingtonâ€™s slave quarters.
The first thing you do when you walk to Washingtonâ€™s slave quarters, is you go, â€œOoh.â€
[audience laughs]
Somehow worse than I thought they were gonna be.
Itâ€™s rough, dude. That guy had a fucking dungeon.
For real. You didnâ€™t know? And Iâ€™m in there, and Iâ€™m by myself, and Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
Remember that time was a tense fucking time in this country, and Iâ€™m there by myself, like, â€œJesus fucking Christ.â€
And then I hear some footsteps coming down the path behind me.
And now, blocking the only exit of the room was a slave reenactorâ€¦
They have those there. And he did not break character.
I turned around, he was like, â€œOh, well, hello there, sir.â€
I was likeâ€¦ â€œJesus Christ, dude, please, you donâ€™t have to do the character. Iâ€™d give anything for you to not do that character.â€
[chuckles]
He didnâ€™t break. He was like, â€œLook at those clothes, you must be from the future. Hello, time traveler.â€
I was like, â€œIâ€™m from right now. What are you doing out? Come here!â€
[audience laughs]
No, I did not say that. Obviously I didnâ€™t fucking say that. I didnâ€™t say a word, I was frozen. I was paralyzed with white guilt. I didnâ€™t say a word. I was justâ€¦ And he knew what he was doing. For real, he knew what he was doing. He wasnâ€™t giving me the George Washington tour. He was just drilling me with shit I didnâ€™t want to hear. He was hitting me with whiteâ€¦ You remember that time. Tense time. That guy walks in there and sees meâ€¦ I know what I look like. I know exactlyâ€¦ I got, you knowâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got the body type of a guy who says, â€œLetâ€™s see the rest of the bodycam footage before we jump to any conclusions.â€
[all laughing]
I know what I look like. He wasnâ€™t giving me the Washington tour. He was just telling me fucked up shit. He was talking about other people.
â€œThomas Jefferson had about six slave children of his own. He only freed two of his own children during his lifetime.â€
I was like, â€œJesus Christâ€¦â€
Isnâ€™t that a bummer? Thomas Jefferson literally enslaved some of his own children?
â€œEhâ€¦â€
Yeah. Now you know how I felt, dude. I was getting fucking drilled with this information. Thatâ€™s when I started playing possum a little bit. I was like, â€œMaybe I am a special needs guy.â€
[audience laughs]
So he was hitting me with the fucking white guilt facts, I wasâ€¦
[audience laughs]
And it was a battle, dude, it was like two wizards fighting.
[audience laughs]
Finally I won by just lowering my mask. He was mid-range. I justâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€œOh, shit. My bad, brother.â€ He fuckinâ€™â€¦
And he let me go.
He freed me.
I went to the George Washington Museum. Thereâ€™s a museum there.
As soon as you walk into that museum, they start pumping up George.
You walk in, theyâ€™re like, â€œGeorge Washington was a great man.â€
And youâ€™re likeâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€œI just came from his dungeon.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œBut you know, Iâ€™m American.â€
â€œIâ€™ll forget about that part of his history.â€
â€œWhat else did he do?â€ You know?
â€œWeâ€™re not gonna let human trafficking define these guys, are we?â€
â€œHuh?â€ [laughs]
I donâ€™t know. Anywayâ€¦
I was in there. I was going through the museum.
Iâ€™ll admit, I still hadâ€¦ I had girl brain towards George, from what Iâ€™d seen.
I was still mad at him.
I was going through the museum like, â€œGeorge Washington, fucking asshole.â€
[audience laughs]
Like, â€œGeorge Washington had red hair.â€
I was like, â€œUgly bitch.â€
[audience laughs]
I was trying to be cool and liberal.
And hate him.
I couldnâ€™t do it, dude. They started pumping up George, it got me going.
[chuckles]
Going through the museum, theyâ€™re like, â€œGeorge Washington was 6â€™2â€.
I was like, â€œNice.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œHe could never tell a lie.â€ I was like, â€œThis guyâ€™s unbelievable.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œHe single-handedly defeated the British.â€ At this point, Iâ€™m back. [laughs]
Naw, dude, Iâ€™m worse.
â€œNobody better touch my statues. I love statues.â€
â€œIâ€™m ready to get on Facebook, defend Rittenhouse, whatever I need to doâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œâ€¦to help this country get better.â€
Iâ€™m back, 100%. Love America. Love George Washington.
Then you get to the end of the tour, and the last thing you see on the Washington tour is George Washingtonâ€™s teeth, in a case.
If youâ€¦ You know, the myth is, George Washington had wooden teeth.
Turns out, George Washington hadâ€¦ It was ivory and lead dentures, with horse and cow teeth on the top row, and human slave teeth on the bottom row.
[audience murmurs]
â€œUhâ€¦â€
â€œWhat the fuckâ€¦â€ Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s how the tour ends. Youâ€™re gonna walk outside to a hot sunny parking lot, like, â€œWhat the fuck was that at the end?â€
[audience laughs]
Also, lead with the teeth. Show me the teeth right away, dude.
Donâ€™t make me love George Washington for two hours, and then at the very end be like, â€œWanna see some wild shit?â€
Likeâ€¦
[all laughing]
And once you see his teeth, every story about him makes perfect sense.
Like, â€œHe was a man of few words.â€
Itâ€™s like, yeah, dude, he had fucking donkey teethâ€¦
[all laughing]
Had lead in his mouth for a decade.
You canâ€™t keep lead in your mouth for a decade.
That would give youâ€¦ for real, like, rabies-like symptoms.
Youâ€™d be like, â€œArgh.â€
Like, â€œI canâ€™t believe we defeated the British.â€
I know how we did it.
We had a fucking six foot two, redheaded retarded guyâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦out in the woods, just waiting for those motherfuckers, dude.
Six-two in 1770, thatâ€™s like six-ten today.
[audience laughing]
Red hair, horse teeth, a sword, justâ€¦
[yells]
â€œYou wanna tax me, motherfucker?!â€
[audience laughs]
You know how terrifying that guy was, coming out of the woods like, â€œAaah!â€
And some five-foot British guy, â€œOh!â€
[audience laughs]
â€œRun, itâ€™s George!â€
You ever seen that painting of George crossing the Delaware?
Standing. Heâ€™s the only one standing on the rowboat.
Everyone else is like, â€œGeorge, you gotta get down.â€ [laughing]
â€œTheyâ€™re over there, get â€™em!â€
[audience laughs]
Know what happened that day when George crossed the Delaware?
It was Christmas day, and, uh, it was a bit of a massacre, because George caught the British off-guard, because, uh, the British absolutely correctly assumedâ€¦
They were like, â€œOnly a retarded guy is gonna try to crossâ€¦ [laughs] â€¦this icy river today in a rowboat.â€
Fortunately for them, our first president was on the other side of that river.
[audience laughs]
Heâ€™s like, â€œGet in the boat, we gotta kill these motherfuckersâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
I know I said â€œretardedâ€ there a couple of times.
My bad on that.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™m not trying to give myself a pass on being able to use that word.
But I will say, I donâ€™t know if you can tell by looking at me,
I do have family members with Down syndrome.
It almost got me, Iâ€™mâ€¦
[audience laughs]
I dodged it, but it nicked me, it nicked me.
Bit of a daywalker myself.
[audience laughs]
Fuckinâ€™â€¦ [laughs]
When you bring up Down syndrome, you can always tell whoâ€™s never been around it in their lives.
If I tell people, like, â€œI have family members with Down syndrome,â€
people thatâ€™ve never been around it are always like, â€œOh.â€
Like Down syndrome is the fucking end of the world. Like, â€œOh.â€
â€œAre they okay?â€
â€œYour faâ€¦ Are they doing okay?â€
Itâ€™s like, theyâ€™re doing better than everybody I know.
Theyâ€™re the only dudes I know having a good time pretty consistently.
Sorry theyâ€™re not on fucking Adderall and anti-anxiety like the rest of us.
Theyâ€™re on fucking Capri-Sunsâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦having a good time.
My uncle Dannyâ€¦
My uncle Danny sneaks grilled cheese sandwiches in restaurants, just in case they donâ€™t serve grilled cheese sandwiches.
We donâ€™t know where heâ€™s getttinâ€™ these fucking things. Itâ€™s the best.
Youâ€™ll be out to dinner with him, you look across the table, you see him sneaking a grilled cheese, justâ€¦
â€œHey, yo, whereâ€™d you get that chee, Danny?â€
[audience laughs]
His Dadâ€™s with him, like, â€œThat fucker, heâ€™s been making â€™em at night, I know.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œIâ€™m not making them at night, Dad.â€
[audience laughs]
Then he looks at you. â€œIâ€™m making them at night.â€
[audience laughs]
Whatâ€™s better than that, dude?
Whatâ€™s better?
[audience cheering]
Whatâ€™s betterâ€¦
[cheering continues]
Whatâ€™s better than Uncle Danny?
Uncle Danny, 3:00 in the morning.
Shirtless.
[audience chuckling]
Baggy gym shorts.
Quietly. Secretly in his parentsâ€™ kitchen.
On a secret mission to make ten grilled cheese sandwiches.
[audience laughs]
Every day, his dad comes down the stairs, â€œWhereâ€™s the fucking bread going?â€
[audience laughs]
Heâ€™s got eight sandwiches in a closet.
â€œDonâ€™t go in my room!â€
[audience laughs]
Top. [chuckles]
Down syndrome rules, you know?
Obviously, thatâ€™s not how you say it.
You donâ€™t go around saying, â€œFucking Down syndrome rules.â€
Iâ€™m saying it wrong. Iâ€™m notâ€¦ Iâ€™m not discounting the fact that itâ€™s hard for families, it is. Iâ€™ve witnessed it first hand. Itâ€™s difficult. Itâ€™s fuckinâ€™â€¦ Itâ€™s scary. Itâ€™s very scary at first.
And then you quickly realize thatâ€™s easily the only good family memberâ€¦ we have.
Thatâ€™s the only good person I know.
Theyâ€™re the bros, dude, theyâ€™re the perfect brâ€¦ Theyâ€¦ They love two things, dude. They love John Cena.
[audience laughs]
Across the board.
Dude, you see one of these dudes out in public, hit â€™em with aâ€¦
[audience laughs]
Theyâ€™re gonna give it back, they love him.
And they love tits.
[audience laughs]
Dudes with Down syndrome love tits, and itâ€™s a very uncomfortable truth for a lot of people.
And Iâ€™m not sure why.
Tits rule.
John Cena rules.
Itâ€™s kinda the two coolest things.
Butâ€¦ This jokeâ€™s probably not gonna make it, butâ€¦ [laughs]
[audience laughing]
Hereâ€™s what Iâ€¦
Hear this one out. Iâ€™m gonna try.
If you see it, just know I won an argument.
[audience laughs]
â€˜Cause I think itâ€™s good, but alright.
Dudes with Down syndrome love women so much, that, like, Iâ€™ve never been a believer of being gay as a choice, but I will say, every dude I know that canâ€™t think, fucking loves pussyâ€¦
[audience laughs]
[audience cheering]
Alright. [chuckles]
I guess itâ€™s a keeper.
[audience cheering]
Alright, thatâ€™sâ€¦ thatâ€™s the end of that.
[audience laughs]
Thatâ€™s where that should end. Look.
I was talkinâ€™ earlierâ€¦ Iâ€™m notâ€¦ Iâ€™m not a Republican yet, but I will sayâ€¦
I just wanna seeâ€¦ Like, for real, I donâ€™t care if they arrest him, if he loses the Primary, I donâ€™tâ€¦ Let him debate, dude.
Let him debate.
All I wanna see is the debate.
[audience whistling]
Dude.
[audience cheering]
I donâ€™t care, if he gets arrested, Hannibal Lecter him out to the front, justâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦bring him on stage.
Hereâ€™s my idea. Final debate of the year.
Have one Republican candidate, one Democrat.
Be like, â€œAlright, fellas, surprise third guest tonight.â€
[audience laughs]
Fuckinâ€™ â€œStone Coldâ€ music, the glass shatters.
He walks out justâ€¦ [sucks teeth] â€œTheyâ€™re both gay.â€
[audience laughs]
I mean, see how they handle that.
I think itâ€™s important to see
how the candidates handle that type of pressure of debating with Trump, dude, â€™cause none of them have been able to handle it.
He literallyâ€¦ Every debate, he just bullied whoever was up there.
The only one who did pretty good in the debates against him was Biden, just â€™cause he had no fucking idea what was being said.
[all laughing]
Which actually helped him. That worked out for him.
â€˜Cause Trumpâ€™s whole thing is he tries to get in the other guyâ€™s head.
You canâ€™t get in Joeâ€™s head.
[audience laughs]
â€œJoeâ€™s not in there. Good luck, dude.â€
[audience laughs]
Bidenâ€¦ Biden is Trumpâ€™s kryptonite in a debate.
Heâ€™s literally perfect.
He canâ€™t beat him, â€™cause Trumpâ€™s wholeâ€¦
Trump tries to drag the other guy into a shit-talking contest where he will win.
He will win at that. He canâ€™t get Biden. He tries.
Every debate heâ€™s trying so hard, and Bidenâ€™s justâ€¦
[audience laughs]
Thatâ€™s it the wholeâ€¦ He tries, heâ€™s justâ€¦ [imitates Trump, sucks teeth] â€œYouâ€™re a loser.â€
â€œYour son did crack.â€
And Bidenâ€™s justâ€¦ [imitates Biden] â€œWhat?â€ Itâ€™s likeâ€¦
[audience laughs]
Right there, dude. Thatâ€™s actually a pretty good comeback.
You might win this thing.
I miss it. I miss the speeches with Trump.
You remember that? We used to get five speeches a day when he was in office.
Anytime you turned on the TV, the guy was giving another fucking speech.
Live, dude.
Be in front of a helicopter, screamâ€¦ calling a lady a lesbian or something.
[audience laughs]
[groans uncertainly]
This could be a tough one to defend at work.
[audience laughs]
But Iâ€™m gonna. [chuckles]
[audience laughs]
Now itâ€™s sad. Now with Biden we get, like, one speech every three months.
And itâ€™s hard. He, like, falls and shit. Itâ€™s hard to watch.
Itâ€™s sad. Iâ€™m rooting for the guy. I obviously want things to go well.
But itâ€™s hardâ€¦ to watch him do anything.
Anytime I watch Biden do anything, I get the same feeling as likeâ€¦
Ever go to a friendâ€™s house and they have, like, a 16-year-old dog and it walks in the room? And you gotta do that whole, like, â€œOh, hey, there he is.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œJust look at him, heâ€™s looking great.â€
My favorite thing about Biden is, anyâ€¦ anytime Biden finishes a speech, he transforms into a Roomba.
[audience laughs]
Like aâ€¦ Yeah.
[audience cheering]
I miss it. I miss the Trump speeches.
Trump gave what I think was probably one of the greatest speeches a world leader has given.
You know, itâ€™s gotta be up there with, like, Churchillâ€¦ Gettysburg addressâ€¦
[chuckles]
Anywayâ€¦ For real, it was my favorite speech Iâ€™ve ever seen a president give.
It was the night the United States killed the leader of ISIS.
Trump comes out of the Situation Room, at like, midnight, in the White House.
He walks down that fucking tunnel and gives a press conference, like heâ€™s giving a post-game NBAâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦just killed a guy press conference.
He walks up in front of the entire world at midnight and just goesâ€¦
[imitates Trump] â€œAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.â€
â€œHe died like a dog.â€
[laughing]
[audience cheering]
[speaking normally] Itâ€™s all good, dudes. [chuckles]
I didnâ€™t change one word of that, thatâ€™s what he opened with.
And then he did 40 minutes. The speech is 40 minutes.
For no reason, it wasnâ€™t a prepared speech.
He freestyled 40 straightâ€¦
Not even a speech. Just mean shit talk for 40â€¦
The meanest shit talk youâ€™ve ever heard in front of the whole world.
[sucks teeth, imitates Trump] â€œAbuâ€¦â€
â€œWe could hear him crying. I said, â€˜Abu, donâ€™t cry. Abu.'â€
â€œLet me tell you something. Abu cried, he cried quite a bit.â€
â€œI wouldnâ€™t have cried.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œâ€˜Cry-baby Baghdaddy, â€˜ thatâ€™s what we were all calling him.â€
[chuckles]
Look.
I love everything about that speech.
I love it. I love thinking about Trump in the Situation Room, surrounded by generals, watching a liveâ€¦
Watching Special Forcesâ€¦ Watching those cocksucking Navy SEALs.
[chuckles]
[audience laughs]
If I was in there, Iâ€™d be like, â€œGet out, Abu, run!â€
[audience laughs]
â€œTheyâ€™re great lovers, donâ€™t let them get ya.â€
â€œAh, they got him!â€
â€œAh, theyâ€™re making him squirt.â€
[audience laughs]
Goingâ€¦
â€œNo!â€
â€œNo! How could you do this?â€
[audience laughs]
[chuckles]
Thatâ€™s what we should do instead ofâ€¦
You know, instead of zero dark thirty, killing these guys, we should break in and have Special Forces fucking whack â€™em off in their own bed.
[audience laughs]
That sends a pretty serious message, dude.
Imagine that, just four Navy SEALs holding your arms and legs.
Youâ€™re the only dude without night vision.
[audience laughs]
â€œNo!â€ [chuckles]
[groans]
â€œQueer.â€
[audience laughs]
[audience cheering]
They fly away on a helicopter.
You just got jerked off in your own bed.
â€œYou fucking jerked me off!â€
â€œYou make me do cum!â€
[audience cheering]
Know what I mean?
[audience cheering]
Anywayâ€¦
Yeah.
I, uhâ€¦
No, I justâ€¦ I loveâ€¦
I love thinking about Trump in the Situation Room watching a live military operation.
Heâ€™s the only dude in the room that wasnâ€™t military.
He must have been the only dude watching it that was like, â€œOh!â€
Right?
[all laughing]
You can tell heâ€™s never seen it before by the fucking speech.
His speech sounded like a guy just trying to tell you some shit he saw.
Justâ€¦ [sucks teeth]
[imitates Trump] â€œA lot of guys wouldâ€¦ knock on the front door.â€
â€œNot these guys, not our guysâ€¦â€
[sucks teeth] â€œNot our guys, our guys went through the wall, they blew up his wallâ€¦â€
[sucks teeth]
â€œAnd they used dogsâ€¦â€
â€œBeautiful dogsâ€¦â€
[laughs, speaks normally] Dudeâ€¦ â€œBeautiful dogsâ€ is the funniest detailâ€¦ â€˜Cause itâ€™s true. They actually did useâ€¦ It was the Army Rangers and they used dogs, â€™causeâ€¦ they were afraid al-Baghdadi was gonna be wearing a suicide vest, so they killed him with dogs and a robotâ€¦
[chuckles]
â€¦and then made fun of him for crying?
[laughs]
â€œLet that guy cry.â€
Thatâ€™s the scariest death Iâ€™ve ever heard of. That dude was laying in his bed at night and his wall exploded. Fucking ten dogs and a robot broke into hisâ€¦
[laughs]
Dude, ten dogs wearing helmets and goggles broke into his house. The Paw Patrol! The actual Paw Patrol!
[audience laughs]
Alright, dude, you guys have been so great.

[crowd cheering]
[announcer] Denver, give it up for Andrew Santino!
[crowd cheering]
Yeah! Come on!
[crowd continues cheering]
Yeah! Denver, Colorado, thank you!
[crowd cheering]
Yeah. Oh! You guys, the best. Thank you for coming out. Iâ€™m glad to do it here. I wanted to do it in Denver. I wanted to do it before, uhâ€¦ But, uh, China had other plans, andâ€¦ [chuckles] Little â€˜Roney hiccup. We had a little hiccup for the Ronies. I got it, and then I got the vaccine. I had friends that were like, â€œDude, you already had it.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t need to get the vaccine.â€ And I was like, all right, I understand what youâ€™re saying, but they just I wanted to hear out the antivaxxers. I wanted to hear what they had to say. Iâ€™m a contrarian. Let me hear what they got to say. But their PR was terrible.
[crowd laughing]
They had, like, one meeting and were like, â€œYou donâ€™t know whatâ€™s in it.â€ Thatâ€™s not going to work. I had a bratwurst three days ago. Iâ€™ve never known whatâ€™s in those things. Have you ever known whatâ€™s in those things? What are you talking about. â€œDonâ€™t know whatâ€™s in it,â€ is the most fun phrase. We used to do ecstasy in high school all the time. Yeah, not Molly. Not that pussy shit you guys do today. We did Drano, dude, we did Drano drips. Iâ€™m glad itâ€™sâ€¦ Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m done with it, dude, itâ€™s nuts. My dad, dude, my dad got it and didnâ€™t tell anybody. And then went to the ER, didnâ€™t tell anybody. Got out, and then gave me a ring. I swear to God, he called up, he was like, â€œHey, just got out of the hospital.â€ I was like, â€œAre you okay? Did you fall?â€ Because at certain ages, they just fall a lot. Heâ€™s like, â€œNah, â€˜Rona.â€ I was like, â€œOh my God!â€ â€œAre you okay?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œDude, in and out.â€ â€œFive days, in and out. Knocked it right out.â€ Like, thatâ€™s a work week. Thatâ€™s a long time to be in the ER. He was like, â€œNo big deal, though.â€ I was like, â€œWere you on a ventilator?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo! At night, they gave me a breathing thing and I was fine.â€
[laughs]
I was I talked to my buddy who works in the ER. I was like, â€œYeah, he didnâ€™t want to tell anybody he got sick.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, thatâ€™s a thing. His generation, their ego, their pride, they donâ€™t want to admit that they got it.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œBut he shouldnâ€™t feel bad.â€ â€œThereâ€™s so much more weird shit that goes on in the ER.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œI know. I bet. Tell me. I want to hear it.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œI canâ€™t, dude. Itâ€™s like, doctor-patient privileges, and itâ€™s unprofessional. Itâ€™s kind of unethical.â€ And I was like, â€œIâ€™ve gotten high with you between shifts.â€ So, let me know. You know what I mean? He goesâ€¦ He goes, â€œAll right. One time, this guy, him and his girlfriend were playing with sex toys, and they were using them on each other, having a good time.â€ â€œThey had this thing called the Screaming Bullet, just a little tiny vibrator, and they were using it.â€ â€œAnd then she decided to flip the script, use it on him, change it up, change up the batting order, weâ€™ll see whoâ€™s next.â€ â€œSo sheâ€™s using it on him, and I donâ€™t know if the tides were strong that day, or the moon was in retrograde or whatever, but it just [sucking sound] â€œgot sucked up inside of his ass.â€ â€œYeah, his ass was like, â€˜Give me that vibrator!'â€ Like when you used to lose a cassette tape in the deck of the car and youâ€™re like, â€œNo, no, no, no!â€ Itâ€™s never coming out. And your car would tease you, itâ€™d spit it back out, but suck it in and go, â€œBleh-eh.â€ â€œBleh-eh.â€ So this poor gentleman had a little mini-vibrator in his butt, just banging off the walls. Like Brick Breaker, just like, â€œBop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.â€ And they couldnâ€™t get it out of this poor fella. And so this gentleman had to go to the ER where my buddy works at. This guy went to the ER. Yeah. Instead of killing himself, he went into the ER. Instead of obviouslyâ€¦ [imitates gunshot] No way am I going to the ER! People are saying goodbye to their loved ones. People are like, â€œNana, donâ€™t go. Weâ€™re going to miss you, Nana.â€ And you got to walk by likeâ€¦ [vibrating sound] â€œSir, sit down.â€ â€œItâ€™s way worse if I sit down!â€ â€œItâ€™ll echo through the halls.â€
[crowd laughing]
Iâ€™m weary of the medical profession to begin with. Do I have any doctor fans? Raise your hand if youâ€™re a doctor.
[people whooping]
No way! Blown away. Iâ€™m just weary of the medical profession. I appreciate everything you guys do. I just think sometimes, you know, sometimes youâ€™re just fucking with us a little bit. Like, you know the phrase, â€œHeâ€™ll never walk againâ€? Youâ€™ve all heard that. Everyone in here has heard, â€œOh, heâ€™ll never walk again.â€ What ends up happening? Walks again! Walks again everyâ€¦ Has never not walked again. Has always walked again. And here I was, stoned at, like, three in the morning watching TV, and they threw on one of those sad commercials thatâ€™s like a two-minute commercial with, like, a dog or a veteran or an old person to just get you really riled up at night for some reason. And Iâ€™m stoned, and they throw this dude on the TV, and it zoomed in on his face, and he goes, â€œThey told me I would never walk again.â€ â€œWell, look at me now.â€ And I was like, â€œPlease donâ€™t show it.â€ Look, all respect, but I know what it looks like, and I donâ€™t want to see it while Iâ€™m high. â€˜Cause Iâ€™m gonna laugh. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m gonna laugh. So donâ€™t show it. And, of course, he goes, â€œLook at me now.â€ And they zoom out, and there he is on the parallel bars, and theyâ€™ve got this poor guy baby-deering to the camera. Like a marionette. And Iâ€™m losing it. Iâ€™m dying laughing, and I feel like a bad person, but I didnâ€™t need to see it. I donâ€™t need proof. No one wants you to prove it. I believe you. Good. Good for you. They would never show it if it was the other way. They would never go, â€œThey told me Iâ€™d never walk againâ€¦ And, boy, were they right.â€ [imitating electric wheelchair] No. No. Because going to the doctor is scary enough. Itâ€™s already scary to hear these other phrases. Itâ€™s scary. You know? My dad had prostate cancer, and then it freaked everyone else. Like, â€œOh my God. I gotta go get an exam. I gotta go get checked out.â€ You know? And so I went. I had to go check it out, go see whatâ€™s going on in there. And thereâ€™s no way to prepare you for a prostate exam as a guy. Thereâ€™s not. Thereâ€™s some guys out there that go, â€œI know a trick.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œWellâ€¦â€. Itâ€™s different than you think. For the first time in my life, when I went to get a prostate exam, I kind of understood what it might be like to be a woman, to hook up with someone for the first time. I did. A little bit, ladies. Like, I got it a little bit. Because I was in this cold, uncomfortable room with no art on the walls. It wasâ€¦ Very well-lit for some reason. I was just in there alone. And then he just pops in, real confident and brazen and he just goes, â€œTake your clothes off.â€ And I was like, â€œOh my God.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t wanna chat or nothing?â€ So I do. And then he goes, â€œBend over the table.â€ And at that point, I was like, â€œOoh, youâ€™re naughty.â€ I bend over this table, and I hear him applying just an absurd amount of lube to his finger. Like a first-timer, like a rookie, just layering it up. And I gotta tell you something, he goes right in. They go right in. They go right in there, dude, they donâ€™t give you a countdown. Thereâ€™s no warning. Thereâ€™s no, like, â€œA-one and a-two and a right in the poo.â€
[crowd laughing]
No. No. He slides right in there and jams himself into you. And, girls, he doesnâ€™t care about how I feel about it at all. Just having his way with me. And heâ€™s in there, and he literally goes, â€œDo you feel that?â€ And I was like, â€œShow me the guy that said no.â€ Let me meet the gentleman that was like, â€œNo, I donâ€™t feel a thing.â€ â€œWhy donâ€™t you throw another digit in there and see what happens?â€ Yeah, I felt every piece of it. And he just had his way. Didnâ€™t care about me at all. Just did his thing. And then, out of nowhere [popping sound] took his finger out, takes off the rubber, and goes, â€œIâ€™m good.â€ And he leaves. Ladies, he leaves me there. Iâ€™ve got my pants on my ankles, Iâ€™m shivering, Iâ€™ve got lube dripping out of my asshole onto my jeans. Iâ€™m scared like a little kid thatâ€™s been left at an amusement park without his parents. He didnâ€™t get anything to help me wipe up. I have to go across the room with my pants on my ankles just to get paper towels so I can wipe front to back. It was embarrassing. And he never called, the asshole never called. Pig. He was a pig.
[crowd cheering, applauding]
I thoughtâ€¦ Look, I thought I was going to be prepared for the prostate exam, because Iâ€™m going to admit something to you guys, all right? Sometimes, when I masturbate, I like to tickle my butthole with my free hand. Yeah. But that phrase, um, used to scare me. I used to lose sleep at night over that phrase. Yeah, I canâ€™t believe I admitted it now, because for years, I was scared. Every time I would do it, Iâ€™d be done and just walk around my house being like, â€œYouâ€™re a bad guy. Youâ€™re a badâ€¦â€. â€œTheyâ€™re going to get you, man. Youâ€™re going to prison for that.â€ But, yeah. So I tickle my butthole with my hand. Big deal. But I used to be scared about it. Used toâ€¦ Dude, Catholicism got so deep in my head as a kid, I thought that I was going to hell because of it. I was scared, dude, that people were one day going to find out that when I masturbate, I put a finger inside of my butt. How crazy to be scared of that thought? Who cares? Every woman I ever dated, every girl I ever started to have feelings for, I was like, â€œOh, sheâ€™s going to know. Sheâ€™s going to find out somehow.â€ â€œSheâ€™s going to catch me doing it, or Iâ€™m going to have to admit it to her at some point.â€ â€œSheâ€™s finally going to have to come to grips with the fact that when I masturbate, I put a couple fingers inside of my ass.â€ But I donâ€™t care anymore. Tell everybody you know!
[crowd cheering]
Ten people. Tell ten people. Tell ten people, spread the word. Let the world know. Andrew Santino fists himself when he jerks off.
[crowd laughing, cheering]
This one. I think itâ€™s a good thing that we can come to grips with our own sexual deviance, with your own likes. Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re allowed. You should be allowed to feel whatever you want to feel, man. Good thing weâ€™re entering a new time when people can feel comfortable being who they really are, because we couldnâ€™t do that when I was a kid. You couldnâ€™t. When I was a kid, you couldnâ€™t do any of that stuff. If you grew up in the â€™80s and â€™90s, if you did anything non-masculine, if you did anything remotely non-masculine as a dude, the whole neighborhood was like, â€œFag!â€ â€œHa-ha! Santinoâ€™s a fag!â€ And Iâ€™d be like, â€œIâ€™m hugging my dad.â€ Theyâ€™d be like, â€œOkay, fag. Suck his dick, dude.â€ â€œYou heard what he said, Pops. We got to do it.â€ It was crazy. Thatâ€™s crazy. I donâ€™t care about the judgment anymore. Because you donâ€™t know what other people like and donâ€™t like. You know? You donâ€™t know. Who are you to judge other people? Jesus was gay.
[crowd laughing]
Tell me Jesus wasnâ€™t gay. I watched a whole documentary on this guy, the whole time I was like, â€œDamn!â€ It was wild. He was beautiful. He was so hot, this guy. Just jacked. Like an eight-pack, skinny, beautiful long, straight hair. Never fucked girls. What are you talking about, dude? He could have had anybody in town. Have you seen his competition? Have you seen anybody from that time period? Horrific creatures. Everybody walking around likeâ€¦ [with cockney accent] â€œHello, Jesus.â€ They all had ailments he had to fix. No, but instead the guy washed dudeâ€™s feet and got followed around by 12 dudes all day long. All his magic was gay. All his magic was gay. A straight dude would be like, â€œDo you want to see me cannonball into this lake and make all the water come out of it?â€ And he was like, â€œDo you want to see me tiptoe across a pond?â€ Even the way he died, they had him up there. A straight dude would be like, â€œI died doing what I love, man.â€ And he was like, â€œOh, Iâ€™ll be back.â€ â€œWait till my daddy hears about this.â€ He was like, â€œI can change water.â€ Everyoneâ€™s like, â€œMake beer!â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat about Pinot noir?â€ Tell me this isnâ€™t the gayest phrase youâ€™ve ever heard. â€œWhat if we do, like, a Last Supper?â€ â€œWeâ€™ll have that boy from town paint us. You know, the one with a bad eye.â€ And I donâ€™t care if he was, Iâ€™m not saying it with negative connotation. Iâ€™m just saying, who cares? Mind your own business. Arenâ€™t you full? Why are we caring so much about what other people do with their personal time? Donâ€™t you got enough shit going on to care about other peopleâ€™s stuff?
[crowd cheering]
Mind your own business. Do you remember that? We used to do it all the time. I remember being a teenager and I watch a guy get robbed on the subway. He was like, â€œHelp.â€ And I was like, â€œNo, no, no.â€ I got, like, two stops left. Thatâ€™s insane. Iâ€™m not gonna help you. We used to do it a lot. You know? It was something my mom taught me. For a while, she was a single mother. You know, and we werenâ€™t poor, but she would let us steal. You understand? I donâ€™t know if you had that, butâ€¦ If it looked good enough, sheâ€™d be like, â€œTake it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it now. Take it.â€ â€œPut it in your pocket and take it.â€ And we get caught, you know? And she was such a good actor. Sheâ€™d be like, â€œAndrew!â€ â€œI am so sorry. Andrew! Get over here.â€ And then weâ€™d get out of earshot and sheâ€™d be, â€œYou gotta hide it better, buddy. You know that.â€ â€œYou gotta hide it a little bit better.â€ And we never spoke about this for some reason, ever. We never spoke about this, but at my grocery store as a kid, there were these plexiglass bins, and in them theyâ€™d have nuts and candy and chocolate, and you could weigh by the pound. Donâ€™t know if you had that, but youâ€™d get your groceries and youâ€™d weigh by the pound whatever you got. And we never spoke about this one time, ever. Even until this day. We joked about it when she saw me do this joke. She used to stand in front of the bins, lift up the smallest one to the ground, and just stand guard and let me go to town. And Iâ€™d just shovel candy in my little orangutan face. And when I was done, we wouldnâ€™t say anything. I would tap on her thigh, and she would close it, and weâ€™d walk away. And one time, this guy came down the aisle, this rat, this snitch. He came down the aisle and he goes, â€œHey, you have to pay for that.â€ And as smoothly as Iâ€™ve ever seen my mother, simultaneously close and call out, she goes, â€œMind your own fucking business!â€ And he did.
[crowd cheering]
This guy, he fucked right off. It was great. He was like, â€œOh yeah, Iâ€™m an asshole. I should get out of here.â€ â€œThatâ€™s a child.â€ Yeah, you got to mind your own business, dude. Pay attention to your own life. You got your own thing going on. The world is collapsing as we speak, dude. Have fun. Itâ€™s over. Itâ€™s over, dude. Itâ€™s 156 in LA right now. Look, I know global warmingâ€™s real. I know itâ€™s real. There is no question in my mind. But also, itâ€™s pretty impressive. Itâ€™s pretty impressive that this thingâ€™s been around for four and a half billion years. Weâ€™ve been around for 6,000 for civilization, 200,000 as a race, and we broke it. Thatâ€™s pretty rock and roll, dude. Youâ€™re a pussy-ass Earth, is what it is. Itâ€™s sad. Itâ€™s disgusting. No, itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s awful. Itâ€™s awful. But I also donâ€™t want to be yelled at about it, because itâ€™s such a massive problem that youâ€™re like, â€œWhy are you yelling at me about the globe heating up?â€ Thatâ€™s crazy. Iâ€™m not the one that dumped millions of gallons into the ocean of oil. I didnâ€™t do any of that stuff. Why are you yelling at me? I donâ€™t like that. Donâ€™t yell at me, all right? Like, they sent that kid out, Greta Thunberg, they sent a child to yell at us. They sent a child to yell at you, and you took it. All of you just took it. And Iâ€™ll say, this, dude, good on that little girl for having, like, the bravery and the confidence to stand up for something she believes in, for her generation, something that she really cares about, and to talk to adults like that about something sheâ€™s passionate about. Like, good for that kid, dude. Thatâ€™s impressive.
[crowd whooping]
But also, shut up, you little asshole. Fuckingâ€¦
[crowd laughing, cheering]
You never paid a mortgage, you dick. You donâ€™t know how hard this is. You never got a parking ticket when you got 19 bucks left to your name. Shut up. Also, I know sheâ€™s from Sweden, but I didnâ€™t like that little Nazi twang in her voice. You heard it. When she was like, â€œShame on you!â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œHey, hey, hey. What is that? Is that Nazi shit? What was that?â€ Donâ€™t yell at me about shit I canâ€™t control, thatâ€™s the thing. I canâ€™t control that. Why are you yelling at me about something I canâ€™t control? And they bully us about it. They took away straws in California. They made them illegal in some states to serve. Itâ€™s insane. And they took them away and we were like, â€œAll right, I guess.â€ No one asked for proof. No one was like, â€œWhy are you doing this?â€ And they threw away, they go, â€œUh, turtles. Turtles are dying.â€ And we just were like, â€œOh, okay. Seems reasonable.â€ Does it? Where? Where are all these turtles? Iâ€™m almost 40, Iâ€™ve seen six turtles my whole life. Youâ€™re telling me millions of turtles are dying with straws lodged in their heads? Where? Show me the shells. Show me the shellsâ€¦ and Iâ€™ll stop using them. I donâ€™t buy it. Iâ€™m not a smart man, but that math does not add up. The physics on that is crazy. Ocean, big. Ocean, big. Big ocean, yeah? Ocean big, straw float. Turtle move. Tied strong and ocean big. Ocean big, turtle move, tide strong, straw float. Youâ€™re telling me all these elements line up perfectly for a straw to get in a less-than-five-millimeter hole, gah, in a turtleâ€™s head? Thatâ€™s like me flicking a Q-tip in the air and catching it in the tip of my penis.

[cheering]
I donâ€™t know. Look, again, I believe itâ€™s real. I just know itâ€™s white people problems. Whites did this. The whites are at it again. They are. White people want something to complain about. Their lives are pretty easy, so theyâ€™re like, â€œI gotta get mad about something.â€ Black people, for years have been, â€œThe police are killing us.â€ Weâ€™ve been like, â€œAll right, Jamal, weâ€™re thinking about the polar bears right now.â€ â€œCool it out, pal.â€ Thinking about a bear that lives thousands of miles away, and you care more about that than humans that live amongst you? Thatâ€™s not crazy? Thatâ€™s crazy shit. Thatâ€™s fucked up. Weâ€™re fucked up, man. And the only reason you like that bear is because itâ€™s white. Thatâ€™s the only reason. Thatâ€™s the only reason, dude. What about brown and black bears? You guys are like, â€œThose are dirty bears.â€ â€œThey live close to the city. Theyâ€™re bad bears.â€ â€œAnd they steal. They steal.â€ â€œFrom picnickersâ€¦ Or picnickas, I donâ€™t know if you can say it now.â€ But. I donâ€™t know. No, itâ€™s crazy. Itâ€™s crazy. Itâ€™s nuts. Look, maybe polar bears got to go. I donâ€™t know. Weâ€™ve never done this before. This is our first time doing this thing. Thousands of species have come and gone. Maybe itâ€™s time for polar bears to go. Maybe the universe is like, â€œPolar bear. [whistles] Ya gotta go. Ya gotta go.â€ â€œWrap it up. You got to go.â€ â€œWe got something else coming in, dude.â€ Remember dinosaurs? Pretty good thing theyâ€™re not around anymore. Otherwise, youâ€™d leave the show tonight like, â€œFun show.â€ â€œYeah, good time.â€ â€œGreat time.â€ â€œAll right, you guys.â€ â€œGoodbye.â€ â€œGo, go, go, go, go, go.â€ â€œGet in! Get in!â€ Every day. Look, I know itâ€™s real. I know global warming is real. Iâ€™m just saying itâ€™s not my fault. I didnâ€™t do all of it, so stop giving me all the blame. Meanwhile, politicians, they keep doing this stuff to us because they want us to hate each other, get distracted. They get away with everything. We donâ€™t scrutinize them for shit. We get yelled at, they take no responsibility for the stuff that they cause. Where is Joe Biden? Where is that guy? That was the craziest thing on Earth. We got bamboozled. And when I talk shit about Joe Biden, particularly living in LA, immediately, everyone where I live acts like they jumped into a cold pool. Theyâ€™re likeâ€¦ [whimpers, gasps] They canâ€™t believeâ€¦ I would mock the dude. But he stinks! And hereâ€™s the deal. Hereâ€™s the deal. You got tricked. Admit that you got tricked. You got a white for a white. Bad trade.
[crowd whistling, cheering]
Bad trade. Forever, you guys are like, â€œTrump, piece of shit.â€ â€œLetâ€™s get this old, white, out-of-touch piece of shit out of the White House.â€ And I was like, â€œYeah, get him out! What are we putting in?â€ And they were like, â€œAn old, white, out-of-touch piece of shit.â€ We lost.
[crowd applauding]
Thatâ€™s an â€œL,â€ dude. Thatâ€™s an â€œL.â€ You got a white for a white. Bad trade. You got an Accord for a Civic, itâ€™s the same car. Guyâ€™s like, â€œNo, this one doesnâ€™t have the N-word button on it.â€ Yes, it does. Itâ€™s underneath the thing. They just hid it better. He stinks. And this is the problem I have, right? Itâ€™s more the idea that we wanted progress and change. And as a society, thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to do, inclusivity, right? Weâ€™re trying to change the way this country looks. And so thereâ€™s a Black woman in the White House. Sheâ€™s right there. What the fuck is she doing? What is she doing? I got two words for Kamala Harris, push him. Ladyâ€¦ How bad do you want to be President, lady? Itâ€™s right there, home is open. Steal home. Go, go. Go, go, go, go. Come on, Kamala. One hip nudge. One hip nudge. He folds like origami. Right down to the earth. Boom. Youâ€™re President. Donâ€™t you want it bad? Have one meeting in a basement. Have one meeting in a basement. â€œDown here, Joe.â€ [in old man voice] â€œYou down that rickety stairwell, Cababala?â€ â€œThese stairs seem wet. And thereâ€™s no handrail.â€ [normal voice] In my mind itâ€™s Home Alone. She has a bucket of paint. Sheâ€™s like, â€œCome on, you old fuck.â€ You know he doesnâ€™t know her name. What is he, the only 70-year-old white guy thatâ€™s not racist? Shut up. You know he saunters around there, and heâ€™s like, â€œBring me the Black.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œAll right, Joe, we canâ€™t say that anymore, buddy.â€ â€œWe canâ€™t say that. Sit down. Eat your soup. Sit down.â€ â€œSit down.â€ No, the guy stinks, but hereâ€™s the thing. The guy before him was a fucking dipshit too.
[crowd cheering]
This is what Iâ€™m trying to say, youâ€™re allowed to hate all these psychopaths equally. You know that, right? You can like none of these guys. They all suck. They all suck. Theyâ€™re not on your team. Theyâ€™re not your friend. They donâ€™t give a shit about you. They all went to Epsteinâ€™s island, all of them. It was crazy that, like, 15 years ago, psychopath Alex Jones was talking about it, was like, â€œThereâ€™s an island where they fuck kids.â€ â€œAnd the frogs are gay.â€ Back then we were like, â€œThis guyâ€™s nuts!â€ And now weâ€™re like, â€œHe was right!â€ The frogs are gay! You see â€™em hopping around, lily pad to lily pad. Itâ€™s gross! No, Epsteinâ€™s island was a real thing. The flight logs are on the Internet. You can look them up. Theyâ€™re there. Theyâ€™re right there. You can see whoâ€™s on there. All the hits are on there. All your boys, theyâ€™re all on there. Bill Clinton went there, allegedly, 26 times. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ so many times. Those arenâ€™t layovers. That is a direct flight, dude. That wasnâ€™t like, â€œWhere do we have to stop?â€ â€œOh, Epsteinâ€™s. Oh, shit. Okay, well.â€ â€œWhen in Rome, saxophone.â€ [imitates playing saxophone] Come on. But make no mistake, I love shitting on Biden, but also shitting on Trump. That guy was a dumb, fat piece of shit too. That guy stinks. Guy was an idiot. Guy was a fucking idiot. He went after Mexicans, which I hated the most. Because I live in Southern California. I really, really like Mexicans, okay? [crowd cheering] Donâ€™t fuck with my Browns, man. Donâ€™t fuck with my Browns. He went after Mexicans, and I didnâ€™t like it. I hated it. He was likeâ€¦ [in Trumpâ€™s voice] â€œTheyâ€™re lazy criminals.â€ [in normal voice] Was like, lazy? Have you met any of these people? If you havenâ€™t, itâ€™s because theyâ€™re working their third job that day. And criminal? Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ That oneâ€™s true. But I feel. I know my cleaning lady is stealing from us. Thereâ€™s no doubt in my mind. Iâ€™m always like, â€œMaria, those are your shoes?â€ â€œYouâ€™re a size 12 in Jordans? Those are yours?â€ [as Maria] â€œThese are my shoes, Mr. Andrew. These are my shoes.â€ [normal voice] The guy was crazy. The guy is crazy. Heâ€™s also a dick. He was mean as shit. He was mean. He was a bully. He was a dickhead, right? And if youâ€™re going to be mean, you gotta be fun. George Bush was mean, but he was kind of fun. [Chuckles] He had that little bobblehead wobble about him. Heâ€™d say crazy shit, but be followed up with something fun. Heâ€™d be like, â€œWeâ€™re gonna bomb the shit out of Iraq.â€ Youâ€™d be like, â€œOh my God.â€ Heâ€™d be like, â€œNow watch me hit this drive.â€ And we were all like, â€œYeah, bomb Iraq. Whatâ€™re you gonna do?â€ Nah, Trump was just mean. Just mean. â€œBuild a wall.â€ So stupid. â€œWeâ€™ll build a wall.â€ Mean. Build a maze. Thatâ€™s fun. Yeah, I want â€™em in here. Letâ€™s make them work for it a little bit. Couple of turnarounds and go-backs. â€œHe said that end. He said that end.â€ You know? Know what I want at the border? I want the American Ninja Warrior course at the border so bad. Yeah, man. You want citizenship, you got to conquer Midoriyama live. On FOX. I would love to do the post game interviews. Thatâ€™s what I want, the post game interviews. The wrap-ups, when they fail. Just be like, â€œAlejandro, Alejandro, what happened out there?â€ [panting] â€œWell, Andrewâ€¦â€. The first time I was here. â€œI couldnâ€™t do the Warped Wall. I fuck up at the Warped Wall.â€ â€œThis time it was the Salmon Ladder. I canâ€™t do the Salmon Ladder.â€ â€œWell, you know, you get three tries.â€ â€œI know.â€ â€œI can be back in October to fuck shit up in the fall, baby!â€ Yes. I was shocked Trump lasted four years. Four years was wild to me. Four years, and nobodyâ€¦ Nobody, you know? Nobodyâ€¦ Nobody? Pew. [imitates machine gun] [imitates explosion] [imitates stabbing] Nobody. Nobody. Not once. Iâ€™m not advocating for killing a President, but we used to try. We used to give it the old college go. We got some of our best. In a theater like this. I mean, we got one inâ€¦
[crowd laughing]
I went to the I went to the spot where JFK got shot. I went there to Dallas when I was on tour. We stood on the X. You can stand right where it happened. We looked up at the book depository, and simultaneously, we turned to each other and we were like, â€œItâ€™s a good shot.â€ It was far. It was impressive. Weâ€™re justâ€¦ Weâ€™re entering this new time now where, you know, comedy is in this weird space because people have this narrative that kind of gets pushed around by you guys more than us. That itâ€™s like, â€œOoh, what can comedians say?â€ â€œWhat are you allowed to say now?â€ You can say anything you want, right? Doesnâ€™t mean thereâ€™s not gonna be consequences. But youâ€™ve always been able to say whatever you want. There might be consequences of it, right? Like, Chappelle went after the trans people, and trans people got mad. And people were mad that they got mad, and then they were mad Chappelle said what he said. But this isâ€¦ The issue. We live in this place where the beauty is he can say that stuff. They also have a right to be very upset at that. And thatâ€™s the duality of the America that we live in, that youâ€™re allowed to hate it, theyâ€™re allowed to say it. We got to keep fucking moving. Thatâ€™s kind of how it goes.
[crowd cheering]
But they have every right to be mad at what he says. Thatâ€™s fine. And he is gonna say what he wants to say. Chappelle is the GOAT after all. Heâ€™s the GOAT, you know.
[crowd cheering]
Heâ€™s the Greatest of All Trans, andâ€¦
[crowd laughing]
How funny would it be? On his next special, he just comes in heels. Heâ€™s like, â€œGot ya, bitch!â€ David. You did it again. Yeah, thatâ€™s the world we live in, you know? Weâ€™re going to say weird, dumb shit. We agree to this thing. When you guys come to these rooms, you agree to be a part of this thing. Youâ€™re a part of it. Make no mistake. Thereâ€™s always this thing where itâ€™s on us. Itâ€™s on you too. Youâ€™re a part of it because youâ€™re in this secret little room where weâ€™ve kind of agreed to it. And outside of these walls, itâ€™s a different set of rules. But in here, for some reason, itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s strange. Like, whatâ€™s your name?
Whatâ€™s your name?
Brian.
Brian? Brian, you having a fun time tonight?
Yes.
Yeah? [grunts]
[crowd laughing]
Thatâ€™s not funny. Thatâ€™s not funny at all. Brian doesnâ€™t deserve for me to jerk off on him. Brian doesnâ€™t deserve that. But you guys were like, â€œAh-ha-ha-ha! Jerking off on Brian!â€ â€˜Cause youâ€™re in here. You wouldnâ€™t let that go out there. Out there thatâ€™s, â€œNo, no, no.â€ If I bumped into Brian on the street, I was like, â€œHey, man.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œHey.â€ And I was likeâ€¦ [grunts] You guys would be like, â€œLock that guy up.â€ And Iâ€™m sorry, but thatâ€™s my point, youâ€™re a part of it. Because youâ€™re here, youâ€™re in on this thing. Youâ€™re creating this thing with us, you know? You do this all the time. You do this all the time. America loves art, but we donâ€™t wanna know where it comes from. â€œDonâ€™t tell me. Donâ€™t wanna know where it comes from.â€ We do this a lot, but youâ€™re a part of it just as much as I am. You know, Amy Winehouse, her number one song wasâ€¦ â™ª They tried to make me go to rehab And I said, â€œNo, no, noâ€ â™ª And then she died of a heroin overdose. And you guys were just like, â€œWhat happened to Amy?â€ â€œWas she sick?â€ Youâ€™re an idiot. You have to recognize youâ€™re as much a part of this as we are. Youâ€™re responsible too. And I was having this, like, crazy emotional breakdown a couple of months ago. I called my lady, I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know what I want right now.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat do you want from comedy?â€ â€œWhat do you want from all this shit that youâ€™re doing?â€ And I said, â€œI just want to be a cheeseburger.â€ She was like, â€œYou gotta go to the hospital.â€ â€œThatâ€™sâ€¦ Somethingâ€™s wrong.â€ And I meant what I said, I just want to be a cheeseburger. Thatâ€™s all I want. I donâ€™t need some crazy legacy. I donâ€™t need to live on forever. I just want you to enjoy me right now while you have me. Thatâ€™s all I really want.
[crowd cheering]
But just know that you guys are all eating a different cheeseburger. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m talking about. Youâ€™re creating it and making it taste the way you want it to taste, picking and choosing what you like, what you donâ€™t, what youâ€™re offended by, what you agree with, what upsets you, makes you happy. Youâ€™re building your own cheeseburger. So let me be the cheeseburger, but also know youâ€™re fucking making it. You made it. Youâ€™re the creator of this world just as much as we are. You know? But I learned that I donâ€™t know how much I care about legacy. I think I wanna enjoy it now. And thereâ€™s this idea, a lot of people want legacy. They want to live forever, whether itâ€™s through something theyâ€™ve done or through children they have. I tried to have kids, itâ€™s been a tough road. Iâ€™m not gonna lie. Itâ€™s been really, really hard. We did everything. I was taking vitamins and supplements and nutrients and CoQ10 and Proxeed. I changed my diet, my sleep schedule. I did everything. We did everything they asked us to do, man. We stopped drinking. You know? We started exercising more, getting better sleep. We started having sex on a schedule. A schedule, down to the minute when youâ€™re supposed to have sex, in different positions, different times, different places in the house. We started pegging. We were doing everything. Everything. Some of you donâ€™t know what pegging is, andâ€¦ Look it up on the way home. I donâ€™t know what to tell you. No, weâ€™re not doing that. But through the process, I did learn about edging. I learned what edging was. And edging is incredible. I donâ€™t know if you know what this is, but we were reading a book, a Kama Sutra book, and it had all this stuff about trying to enhance your orgasm with your partner. One of these things was edging. Edging is where you get close to ejaculation, then stop, you get close and stop, you get close and stop, and do this over and over and over again. Supposed to heighten pleasure sensors in your mind, your body, and your spirit, so you and your partner have this perfect orgasm. But when I read it, you know, Iâ€™m not a smart man. So immediately I turned to her. I was like, â€œCan you imagine how big my load is going to be?â€ She was like, â€œWhat?â€ I was like, â€œIâ€™m going to blow your fucking back out.â€ Oh my God. Thereâ€™ll be like 30 gallons of it. Sheâ€™s like, â€œNot how it works.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYes, it is.â€ I remember Super Soakers when I was a kid. You didnâ€™t shoot those on the first pump. You werenâ€™t justâ€¦ [pumps, sprays] Uh-uh. You were likeâ€¦ [rapid pumping] Until it was about to break. When it was likeâ€¦ [imitates pumping with resistance] Then you smoke â€™em with that big load. Thatâ€™s not how it works. One good thing I did, though, put away porn. Stopped watching porn. While we were trying to have a baby, â€œStop. Not gonna watch porn.â€ Donâ€™t wanna watch it. Also, I didnâ€™t like it anymore. I gotta be honest with you, pornâ€™s gotten out of control. Used to be lighthearted and fun. Now itâ€™s all family-orientated, for some reason. I donâ€™t like that. I remember the first time I saw it, I was scrolling through my feed and it said, â€œStepdad comes home from work early, finds stepdaughter changing.â€ And I was like, â€œWhat the fuck is this?â€ Then I saw the thumbnail, and I was like, â€œIâ€™m going to check it out.â€ I want to know. What job does he have lets him off at 2:00 p.m.? Thatâ€™s good hours. I like that porn just does its own thing all the time, though. I like that porn adheres to no social rules, right? Youâ€™ll never see a politically correct porn ever. Ever. In all the things that we say societally, youâ€™re not allowed to say that, we donâ€™t say that word, porn doesnâ€™t give a fuck. Youâ€™ll never see a PC porn. Youâ€™ll never see a title that says, â€œLess-than-intelligent CIS white femaleâ€ â€œgets sexually satisfied by CIS African American male.â€ No, itâ€™ll always say â€œDumb white bitch gets pumped by big Black cock.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m clicking that video. Thatâ€™s one of my favorites to watch.â€ I will say, though, I am pro-sex work, Iâ€™m pro that. I think thatâ€™s great. You do whatever you want to do. Sometimes, though, youâ€™ll see an aggressive porn, and youâ€™ll be like, I donâ€™t know if she likes that at all. The feminist in me is just like, â€œBro, sheâ€™s getting skewered.â€ â€œShe cannot enjoy this.â€ But I support women in what they want to do. I try to support women as much as I can in anything they want to do or anything they want to be, because we all know that everyone with a brain goes, â€œWell, we should all be treated as equals.â€ I support feminism in that world completely. Where it gets a little out of control is when feminism makes it a competition for no reason. I saw a shirt this girl was wearing, it said, â€œGirls can do anything boys can do.â€ And I was like, â€œWhen? What? What world are you living in?â€ Thatâ€™s such a dumb phrase. â€œGirls can do anything boys can do.â€ Itâ€™s also a dumb phrase if a guy has a shirt that says, â€œGuys can do anything girls can do.â€ Also not true. What are you talking about? Dude, you guys, you make humans inside of your body. Thatâ€™s crazy. Nine months. Probably the most grueling, excruciating, painful, insane, wild thing that humans do. You do it. So leave us alone. What do you want? Leave us alone. You want to do these jobs? â€œWe can do what you do.â€ You want to? We donâ€™t want to do these fucking jobs. We did them for you. You donâ€™t want to do them either. You tricked us. You tricked us into doing them. Now you want them back? Whatâ€™s wrong with you? Thousands of years ago, we lived in caves, and you guys were like, â€œGo get the food.â€ And we were like, â€œThereâ€™s lions outside.â€ And you guys were like, â€œGo get the food.â€ â€œFine.â€ We donâ€™t want to do these jobs. Theyâ€™re insane. Coal miner. Huh? You want to get black lung? What the fuck are you talking about? You want to be a garbage man? Thatâ€™s insane. Picking up shit all day. What is wrong? You want to be an Alaskan crab boat fisherman? That what you want to do, girls? You wanna lose your teeth and smoke menthols and most likely die at sea? Itâ€™s awfully convenient that you guys want to do all these gigs after we did them all already. Theyâ€™re done. We built all the shit. Itâ€™s over. Look. Who the fuck you think did this thing? You think a sorority threw this together? â€œCome on, Alpha Phi! Brick by brick by brick by brick.â€ Leave us alone. Youâ€™re already mean to us anyway, right? And itâ€™s socially fun to be mean to guys, because weâ€™re big, dumb idiots. I was at a gas station, and this big truck pulled in. A lifted truck with huge tires. And the girl at the pump next to me made eye contact with me, and she goes, â€œUgh.â€ I knew exactly what she said in her head. And everybody in here knows, â€œBig truck, small dick.â€ â€œOh, big car. You got small little penis?â€ â€œYeah, in your big truck with your small little penis?â€ â€œYou compensating for something?â€ Yeah, for the fact that he never had a big truck before, and now he does. You think men are deep? Weâ€™re idiots. When weâ€™re little boys, weâ€™re like, â€œOh, truck. Beep-beep-beep-beep. Ah!â€
[laughs]
And then we get older and we have money, and weâ€™re like, â€œI buy truck.â€ We donâ€™t judge our purchases based on our genitalia. Thatâ€™s insane. We donâ€™t get out of the shower, look at our dick, and weâ€™re like, â€œJeep Grand Cherokee. Cool.â€ We could never do that to you. You know how mad youâ€™d be if we did that to you, girls? Youâ€™d lose your mind if we equated those things, purchases, to your genitalia. If I was like, â€œIs that a Louis Vuitton purse?â€ â€œOh. You got a big clit? Whatâ€™s that?â€ â€œIs that a gushy Gucci? You got a sloppy gushy Gucci? Yeah.â€ Leave us alone. But again, women deserve to be treated like equals. Thereâ€™s no doubt at all. You know? There isnâ€™t, thatâ€™s not even an argument. You know? Youâ€™re tough. Youâ€™re hard to figure out. My dad failed a bunch. He couldnâ€™t get through it. A bunch. A bunch of women came and went. He couldnâ€™t figure it out, the poor guy. And now heâ€™s older, and heâ€™s trying to, you know, get his life back together again. Heâ€™s trying to teach me life lessons. I think as they get older, they want to impart something on you, like a piece of wisdom theyâ€™ve learned. So heâ€™s, like, sneaking it in in weird ways. He sent me a box of, like, old stuff, you know? And on top of it was Sonic the Hedgehog, and it was plugged into SEGA Genesis. And I was like, â€œOh my God. Is this a message?â€ â€œIs he sending me a message?â€ Is he saying, â€œBe a kid. Slow down. Have some fun. Youâ€™re working too hard.â€ So I did. I got stoned, I plugged it in, and I played Sonic for hours. And it was incredible. It was amazing. And at some point, I might have been a little too high. Because I was staring at Sonic and I was like, â€œOh my God.â€ â€œThis goes deeper than I ever thought.â€ â€œIâ€™m Sonic. Sonic is I. I am Sonic.â€ Most men here are Sonic, you donâ€™t even know it. You run through life as fast as you can just to get to the end. Thatâ€™s the goal of the game. Get the coins, give me the money, get to the end. Give me the money, get to the end. Thatâ€™s what most guys do. â€œJust give me the money, let me get to the fucking end.â€ Thatâ€™s the goal of the game. Itâ€™s so twisted, you know? And the whole time, give me the money, get to the end. In the game, just like in life, at some point you bump into these trolls, women, and all of your coinsâ€¦ La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-laâ€¦ Youâ€™re like, â€œGive me my coins!â€ â€œNo!â€ And youâ€™ll never get â€™em back. But I think because of all that knowledge theyâ€™re trying to impart, the one thing that the older generation didnâ€™t really speak to us about was going to talk to somebody. Therapy is great, and for some reason, it still has this, like, â€œI donâ€™t want to tell anybodyâ€ thing about it. I donâ€™t know why. I think itâ€™s incredible. I went and I spoke with someone, and it helped. It really did. And some of the things she said made some sense. You know? She had said this thing, and you can use this if you want. She said, â€œYou know what you gotta do? You gottaâ€¦â€. â€œYouâ€™ve got to adopt happiness.â€ â€œWhen you see someone else having fun, go into it.â€ â€œDonâ€™t get away from it. Go for it, right?â€ â€œItâ€™s going to, by some reason, get to you and itâ€™ll hopefully help you get a little bit of happiness in your life, slowly but surely.â€ I thought, I donâ€™t know, maybe that works, maybe it doesnâ€™t. You know? She said, â€œOr get a dog.â€ And I was like, â€œIâ€™ll get a dog.â€ So I donâ€™t have to talk to people. And I love my dog. And sheâ€™s incredible. Sheâ€™s also a little bit of a pervert, Iâ€™m not going to lie. Itâ€™s disgusting. Sheâ€™s so weird. Whenever we start hooking up, I can hearâ€¦ Her collar jingling down the hallway like a prison guard with the keys when they know the boys are being bad. Whenever we start hooking up, sheâ€™ll start running to the room and we have to close her out. But still, sheâ€™s persistent. Youâ€™ll hear her under the crack of the door, justâ€¦ [panting] Like a detective. Itâ€™s twisted. The moment weâ€™re done, the moment weâ€™re done hooking up, Iâ€™ll open the door, the dog will come in the room, jump on the bed, and go right to the wet spot. Sheâ€™s like, â€œGet her off the bed.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œLet Scruff McGruff figure out the crime.â€ Who done it, Scruff? Was it the Ginger General with a lead pipe in the ballroom? Who did it? Sheâ€™s gross, but I love her. And a lot of times, she is my little safety net. Honestly. Like, if Iâ€™m having a tough day, Iâ€™ll just take her for a long walk. Itâ€™s great. She doesnâ€™t judge, doesnâ€™t give a shit. Iâ€™ll just say to her my problems, and she doesnâ€™t care. Once in a while, sheâ€™ll throw me like, â€œOh yeah, I donâ€™t fucking care.â€ But itâ€™s nice. And one time, I was going through some shit. I was going through some shit, and I took her with me. And, uh, I went to this little hardware store near my house, an old hardware store, a mom-and-pop shop, if you will. Itâ€™s one of these spots where nothing is in the place itâ€™s supposed to be. Smells like cut keys all the time, and no oneâ€™s really working. You know? You canâ€™t find anything. I love it. Itâ€™s great. So I took her with me, and she was acting really rambunctious. And you know if you have a dog, and they pull sometimes, and sometimes you pull back, sometimes they pull hard, and sometimes you snap it a little bit harder. Itâ€™s not hurting them, but it does, ahh, it checks them a little bit. It gives them just a little, â€œAhh!â€ You hit â€™em. You hit â€™em with, â€œCome on, whoâ€™s the adult here? Whoâ€™s the big guy?â€ And youâ€™re not hurting â€™em. But, ahh, it hits them a little bit. They go right back. You hit â€™em. Ahh! [Giggles] They go right back to being happy. So I smoked her a few times. She was getting out of control. Weâ€™re in one of these hardware stores, the aisles are really tight and tiny. Itâ€™s old, you know? And stuff looks like itâ€™s going to fall down on you, above you. All Iâ€™m doing is trying to find this stupid little washer. And Iâ€™m hunting through all these little stupid bags, and sheâ€™s acting rambunctious. So I wrap around my legs, holding her close. And at the end of the aisle, I notice out of the corner of my eye, thereâ€™s a girl there by herself, a handicapped girl. A handicapped girl at the end of the aisle with Down syndrome. And sheâ€™s standing there by herself. And I can see her see the dog without seeing it. I know that she wants to say hi to the dog, but Iâ€™m just in one of those moods. I donâ€™t want to talk to anybody, right? Itâ€™s nothing about her. I just wanted to be alone. And I can hear her under her breath. I can hear her going, â€œPuppyâ€¦â€. Without looking, I was like, â€œYeah, itâ€™s a puppy.â€ â€œYeah, puppy, puppy, puppy, puppy dog, puppy dog.â€ And she goes, â€œOh, cu-ute.â€ And I was like, â€œCome on.â€ She goes, â€œOh, I want to pet her so bad.â€ [sighs] And I took a breath, and I turned and I saw this girlâ€™s face, and it was the most beautiful thing Iâ€™d ever seen. It was stunning. From ear to ear she was smiling, happy. It was unbelievable. I couldnâ€™t describe it to you accurately. You know when a hippie chick is like, â€œYour auraâ€™s blueâ€? You know that thing? She had a glow. Iâ€™m not kidding. For the first time in my life, I saw someone glowing with happiness. And she was beautiful. And I was like, â€œWhatâ€™s my problem?â€ Whatâ€™s my fucking problem? This girl just wants to say hi to this dog, and Iâ€™m letting this get in the way. This is what the therapist was talking about. Adopt happiness. Stop being a grump. Stop being an asshole. So, itâ€™s tough, but through the grit of my teeth, I was like, â€œYou wannaâ€¦ You wanna pet my fucking dog?â€
[crowd laughs]
And she was like, â€œUh-huh.â€ And I was like, â€œGet over here. Pet my goddamn dog.â€ And she came lumbering down the aisles, and she was running so fast, my dog got scared and startled and jumped back and started growling at her. She gets to my dog, and my dogâ€™s likeâ€¦ [growling] And I was like, â€œHey, not her. Come on. Not her. Donâ€™t do that to her, please.â€ â€œWhat are you doing? Cut it out. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that.â€ And she goes, â€œOoh, mean dog.â€ And I said, â€œNo, no, no, not a mean dog.â€ â€œYouâ€™re a new friend. You just got to take it easy.â€ â€œYouâ€™re a new friend. She doesnâ€™t know you that well.â€ And she goes, â€œOh, okay. Okay!â€ So she goes down to pet her again, but at this point, my dog is not fucking with this chick. My dog is like, â€œIâ€™m going to bite your fingers off.â€ And so sheâ€™s jumping at her, like [snarling] trying to bite her hand. The handicapped girl doesnâ€™t take this. She just keeps going for it, she thinks itâ€™s fun. Sheâ€™s trying to play with her, my dogâ€™s trying to kill her. Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, this is how my career ends, right here.â€ And sheâ€™s going for her, and at some point, my dog jumps and nips at her finger and almost clips her hand. For legal reasons, almostâ€¦ Clips her hand. And then the girl pulls her hand away, and her mood completely changes. I mean, boom. The shift was huge. She just lost all that color out of her face. And she got scared, and she was like, â€œBad dog.â€ And I was like, â€œYouâ€™re okay.â€ And I grabbed her hand. â€œShe didnâ€™t bite you. Youâ€™re okay. Itâ€™s okay. That is a bad dog.â€ â€œBad dog! Iâ€™m sorry, but youâ€™re okay.â€ And she goes, â€œSheâ€¦ she doesnâ€™t like people like me.â€ And I was like, â€œDonâ€™t say that.â€ â€œDonâ€™t say that out loud.â€ â€œDonâ€™t say that. Thatâ€™s notâ€¦ thatâ€™s not true at all.â€ And she goes, â€œNo, she doesnâ€™t like people that are like me.â€ And I said, â€œThatâ€™s not true.â€ â€œDonâ€™t you dare say that. Donâ€™t you dare think that, thatâ€™s wrong.â€ â€œSheâ€™s being a bad girl.â€ â€œThis is very strange. Iâ€™ve never seen her do this.â€ â€œShe usually doesnâ€™t like Black people. Iâ€™ve never seen this before.â€ Sheâ€™s black, by the way. Sheâ€™s black. My dog. My dog is black. The handicapped girl is white. Theyâ€™re always white. Does anybody want to debate me on it? Because hereâ€™s the best part of the joke. Hereâ€™s the best part of the joke to me. Is that the story is not true. None of itâ€™s true. Not even a little bit. Itâ€™s all fake. Itâ€™s all totally made up. Itâ€™s fabricated. But it took you on a ride. You were there. You were in the hardware store. You knew what it looked like, what it smelled like. You constructed it in your mind. You made it taste how you wanted it to fucking taste. I didnâ€™t do it. You did it. You did it. Huh? We paint the picture. Whoâ€™s holding the brush? I want you to raise your hand if, when I told the story, you saw a non-white mentally handicapped girl. Yeah. Yeah. Howâ€™s that taste? How does that taste? Huh? Yeah. Youâ€™ll all be driving home, â€œThey are usually white. I donâ€™t know what it is.â€ Denver, I hope you enjoyed the burger. Thank you so very much.
[crowd cheering]
Thank you, guys. Thank you so very much, Denver! I love you guys. Thank you so much. Goodbye, you guys. Good night. Thank you, guys.

[CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING]
Iâ€™m 37 and single.
[CROWD CHEERING, LAUGHING]
Itâ€™s a bad combination. Iâ€™ve gotten pickier. I donâ€™t know how that happened. Iâ€™ve gotten pickier. I was on a dating app, said no to someoneâ€™s name the other day.
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
A name. I saw a name. I was like, â€œFuck that name.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
It was Darlene.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m not dating a Darlene. Iâ€™m not dating a Darlene. Iâ€™m not a husband from the 1950s. Iâ€™m notâ€¦ dating the Wertherâ€™s Originals of names.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m not dating a Sophia, a Blanche, a Rose, a Dorothy. If your name was on Nick at Nite, Iâ€™m not dating you.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I just donâ€™t see a fun future with a Darlene. I canâ€™t envision it. Like, I donâ€™t see, â€œDarlene brings tequila into the movies.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Like, I see, â€œTake off your shoes. Darlene doesnâ€™t like them in the house.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™ve said no to a womanâ€™s dogâ€™s name. I saw profile. â€œMy dog Cameron.â€ I was like, â€œNo.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m not dating someone with a dog thatâ€™s also a financial planner.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Look, are we gonna be at the park? â€œCameron, Cameron?â€ Some guy in a suitâ€™s like, â€œAre you talking to me?â€ Anytime someoneâ€™s profile says â€œspiritual,â€ Iâ€™m fucking out. I donâ€™t know what it means. I donâ€™t think she knows what it means. Every time I see â€œspiritual,â€ I assume she hand dances at a CVS. Justâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Thereâ€™s no music playing. Sheâ€™s like, â€œI caught a vibe.â€ Sheâ€™s ribbon dancing with the big receipt.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And Iâ€™m making assumptions. But I donâ€™t wanna rub crystals on my cock. I donâ€™t. Itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m the issue in all of this. Iâ€™m making the judgments. These are nice people. I get irrationally mad at peopleâ€™s profiles. One woman, her profile said, â€œI like to wake up and read and go for a walk with my morning coffee.â€ My guttural, 37-year-old reaction to that was, â€œFuck off.â€ I knew everything about her from that sentence. I knew the book. I knew the coffee. I knew the walk. Fuck that book about a missing woman. Fuck that book.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Fuck that coffee with a touch of oat milk. Fuck that coffee. Fuck your walk that ended with an Instagram post of a leaf in black and white with â€œautumnâ€ in cursive. Fuckâ€¦ that post. Itâ€™s like, what am I mad at? What am I saying â€œfuck offâ€ to a healthy, functional human being, like a Jewish woman who found a good dairy alternative? What?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Itâ€™s just not real. Itâ€™s not real, right? Thirty-seven and single means Iâ€™ve done level one of dating. I want to be at level three. Right? I want a real profile. I would much rather the profile be like, â€œI like to wake up and scrollâ€¦â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œâ€¦and sip a water thatâ€™s been next to my bed for a month.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
Thatâ€™s a real person. Like, I would love that proâ€¦ â€œI like to wake up and fart, lift up the sheetsâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€¦see if it smells like dinner.â€ We want real on a dating app, but I donâ€™t think I could be that real. This person wrote what they like to do. I canâ€™t write what I like to do. You ever thought of what you like to do? I like to sit on the couch and stare.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
You know what I love to do? I like to look at the phone, look at the TVâ€¦ Go in my room, masturbate, fall asleep like a Jesus painting. Wake up, have a snack, do the whole thing over again. Just phone, TV, masturbate, snack. Phone, TV, masturbate, snack. Phone, TV, call my mom, masturbate, snack.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[WOMAN WHOOPING]
I canâ€™t write that on a dating app. [CHUCKLING] What woman is like, â€œFinally!â€?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œA multitasker.â€ â€œI hope he takes a shit till his leg falls asleep.â€ Thirty-seven and single means you have married friends, and they try to help, and they cannot help. And I know some of you are here with married friends that try to help. Let me give a message to you from them, â€œShut the fuck up.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Youâ€™re not helping. It doesnâ€™t matter how extreme a married personâ€™s story is, they tell it as if you should do it too. Theyâ€™ll look you dead in the eye. â€œI met Robert in seventh grade.â€ â€œHave you tried seventh grade?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Youâ€™re not allowed to disagree with them. Itâ€™s too exhausting. So youâ€™re like, â€œI gotta start trying seventh grade.â€ â€œI gotta enroll in the middle school.â€ â€œI gotta go to one of those Kumon and do after school activities.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Married men donâ€™t try to help you at all. They donâ€™t care. The only thing married men talk about is how they wouldâ€™ve crushed it on Tinder. Thatâ€™s the only thing they say. â€œOh man, if I was singleâ€¦â€ Itâ€™s like, I knew you then.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Married women are weird. Theyâ€™re condescending. Women seem to be in this competition thatâ€¦ that I donâ€™t even believe in. Like, â€œMarried, winning. Single, losing.â€ That seems to be the case. So, when all of my friends who are my age get married, they act like they have no memory of being single whatsoever. Like, theyâ€™re not allowed to admit they remember it, because it was fun. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œI donâ€™t even remember.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œOh, what was it, 2012?â€ â€œWas the internet around back then?â€ â€œI think I just played Snake on my phone all day.â€ â€œWhere am I? Iâ€™m so old.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œI think my father got a cow in the transaction.â€ Theyâ€™re so bizarre. I was at Fourth of July. I pulled out Bumble, the dating app, in front of my married friend. Her body jutted away.
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
Legitimate. It was like I pulled out my pet cock and balls, and I was like, â€œHere.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I pull out Bumble. She goes, â€œI wouldnâ€™t even know how to use that.â€ I was like, â€œAre you stupid?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œBrief tutorial. Left, no.â€ â€œRight, fuck.â€ â€œYouâ€™re caught up. Easier than Seamless. Youâ€™re good.â€ Then she looked me in the eye. She had this weird speech. She goes, â€œThank God I am not single today. Thank God!â€
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] â€œThank God!â€ She kept going. â€œThank God! Thank Jesus Christ!â€ I thought she was gonna start preaching. â€œLet me get an â€˜amenâ€™ for being married!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œI said, â€˜Thank you, Jesus!'â€ â€œNo more first dates. Thank you, Jesus!â€ â€œNo more random cock on my phone!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
She was thanking a higher power that she didnâ€™t have my life.
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
You donâ€™t think thatâ€™s condescending at all? Now I do that to her baby. [CHUCKLING]
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
â€œTimmyâ€™s up from his nap.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI wouldnâ€™t even know how to use that.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
And then I march around, â€œCan I get an â€˜amenâ€™ for having no kids?â€ â€œCan I get a â€˜thank you, Jesusâ€™ for masturbating with the door open?â€ â€œThank you!â€ â€œI said, â€˜Thank you, Jesus!'â€ [CHUCKLING] â€œI said, â€˜Thank you, Jesus, â€˜ for not sharing a mortgage with someone I used to love.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
That last one sounds bitter.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I agree. Thatâ€™s something Iâ€™ve had to deal with. You sound bad, as a single person. I sound bad. We have to admit we sound bad to our married friends. Theyâ€™re right a little bit. They try to help, and weâ€™re not really good to help. â€˜Cause weâ€™re aspirational. Weâ€™re not easy to deal with. My dad tried to set me up. My dad lives in Florida. I live here. He called me. He goes, â€œYou know, a woman in Miami would like to meet you.â€ I was like, â€œDo you have any more information?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
He goes, â€œYouâ€™re so picky.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
What is weirder in that scenario? Me asking for a picture or what she does for a living, or me booking a ticket?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Flying to Miami, going to a busy street corner. â€œIâ€™m here!â€ â€œI hear thereâ€™s someone looking for a chubby Jew.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
But thatâ€™s the thing. Yourâ€¦ your married friends hear something different than what weâ€™re saying. You are hungry. They have brought you food. And youâ€™re like, â€œIs it organic?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I see it from my single friends too. I see it. Iâ€¦ I understand it. I was out for lunch with my friend. I was scrolling on Instagram, she was swiping on Bumble. You know, how friends have lunch.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Just hanging out to the sound of each otherâ€™s breath. She gets a match, a match. She holds up the phone. She goes, â€œLook at this fucking loser.â€ That was a match.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And I understand that. When youâ€™re on a dating app, you get good-looking all of a sudden. Iâ€™m okay looking, but when Iâ€™m on there, Iâ€™m like a judge on Americaâ€™s Next Top Model. Iâ€™m on there, â€œEw, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.â€ â€œMaybe.â€ You ever do the maybe swipe, like youâ€™respecial?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œThey should have the pleasure.â€ â€œTrash.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I love watching The Bachelor.
[WOMEN CHEERING]
If you are single and you love watching The Bachelor, youâ€™ll have one married friend who will look at you and say, â€œYou should go on!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
â€œYou should go on!â€ Iâ€™m here to tell us, â€œNo, we shouldnâ€™t.â€ Iâ€™ve met some of the contestants. Thereâ€™s one thing they all have in common. They are tall, Adonis-like, tree-like figures. If I went on that show, I would look like a bush.
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
It would look like I showed up to the wrong reality TV show. Theyâ€™d be like, â€œThis isnâ€™t Man v. Food.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Honestly, it would look like a Make-A-Wish.
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
I would get out of the limo, Iâ€™d be like, â€œHi, I make the funnies.â€ Andâ€¦ sheâ€™d start talking too loud. [SHOUTING] â€œHi, thank you for coming!â€ â€œItâ€™s so special to have you here!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And if I ever went on The Bachelorette and then became the bachelor, I could neverâ€¦ The showâ€¦ Iâ€™m too judgmental. The show would be one episode. I would see a foot come out of the limo. Iâ€™d be like, â€œGet her the fuck out!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œWas that red nail polish? I donâ€™t date hoes.â€ Theyâ€™d introduce themselves. â€œYour name is Kathryn with a Y? Get the fuck out my house right now.â€ â€œIâ€™m sorry, youâ€™re from â€˜Warshington?â€™ Thereâ€™s no R in that state.â€ â€œGet your arse out of my harse, now.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I would make up games. Iâ€™d be like, â€œLadies, tonight, take off your eyelashes.â€ â€œI wanna see whatâ€™s under the hood.â€ The show would be one episode. It would end with me and the host in an empty mansion. And I would look at them while we ate pizza. Like, â€œUgh, I guess it was a bad crop this season.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] So I understand that level of delusion. She holds up the phone. She goes, â€œLook at this fucking loser.â€ And I look at the picture. It was a clichÃ© picture. And she was angry. Itâ€™s one a lot of people get. It was the guy holding the fish.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] Look, the villagers are angry.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
You guys got visibly upset. You didnâ€™t see the picture. She was the same way. Sheâ€™s like, â€œThese fucking fish. Fucking losers.â€ â€œWhat the fuck is up with them?â€ â€œWhat do they think, we wanna see a dead fucking fish?â€ I had to calm her down. I was like, â€œNot your match, not your problem.â€ I even did some fish humor. I go, â€œThrow him back.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING, APPLAUDING]
She was so mad at the fish picture. It wasâ€¦ Itâ€™s not even rational. What do you think, he did that picture to get you? You think guys cockblock themselves on purpose? You think he was on a boat like, â€œHand me that fish, I wanna fuck with some lonely women.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
He had the best of intentions. What do you think? Let me ask you the same question I asked her. â€œHow many opportunities do you think straight men get for a lone picture?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Do you think we go on a bachelor party the same way you go on a bachelorette party? A bachelorette party is a series of photoshoots, and everyone has a role. Creative director bitch. Lighting bitch. The chick who takes the hip of your bikini and puts it above your nipple.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
You think Iâ€™m going on a bachelor party making an announcement to my friends for an alonesie?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
You think Iâ€™m looking at them? â€œHey, guys, before we get started here.â€ â€œIn Vegas, I wanna just get a brief announcement in.â€ â€œI know you guys will never make fun of me.â€ â€œIf you see me giggling in front of a sunset, or in a vineyard, or in front of a mural in a gentrified neighborhoodâ€¦ â€¦could you pop off some candids?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œIâ€™m looking for love.â€ You canâ€™t pull out a phone at a bachelor party. Some guyâ€™s like, â€œGet that the fuck outta here!â€ â€œI got kids, man. You trying to get me in trouble?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
This guy caught a fish. Have some respect. He caught a fish.
[CROWD CHEERING] There you go. With only one intention, impressing you, and you see itâ€¦ â€œThis fucking fishâ€¦â€ He looked at that fish. He was like, â€œOh shit, I can look like a provider.â€ [CHUCKLING]
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And then heâ€™s like, â€œLook handsome.â€ â€œThis is the one that finds you â€˜the one.'â€ â€œLook like you own a boat. Look like you own a boat.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m the same way. I have my own versions of the fish picture. I have my own versions that are irrational. I was at a gender reveal party. Okay, it just got uneasy in here.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I was at a gender reveal party, and I was complaining about someoneâ€™s profile. The profile was a lot like the fish picture. This woman wrote, â€œNever have I ever eaten fish.â€
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
Okay, some of you didnâ€™t react enough.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I didnâ€™t say, â€œI donâ€™t eat fish.â€ â€œI donâ€™t eat fishâ€ is reasonable. Tried it, didnâ€™t like it. Not for me. â€œNever have I everâ€¦ eaten fish.â€ Sheâ€™s not ten years old. [CHUCKLING] This is a 38-year-old woman. Some of you are too woke to get involved in this.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I can see youâ€™re like, â€œWhat religion is he offending right now?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
All of the religions eat fucking fish. â€œNever have I ever eaten fishâ€ can only mean dating her is a pain in the fucking ass. Like, she goes to lunch with her friend, someone gets the fish tacos, sheâ€™s like, â€œHey guys, you knowâ€¦â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™d put it right up to her mouth. Iâ€™d be like, â€œPut it in right now.â€ â€œEnd thisâ€¦ end this personality trait that you think is interesting.â€ â€œEnd it right now.â€ â€œWe donâ€™t have to hear this story anymore.â€ â€œPlease, for the love of fucking God, put in your mouth so we can hear a new story from you and see if youâ€™re a real person.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Look, Iâ€™m not going with that woman to the cape. Iâ€™m not taking her to the cape. Am I gonna be, â€œIâ€™ll have the lobster. Sheâ€™ll have the chicken nuggiesâ€? [CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œSheâ€™s got a long story to tell you about it.â€ [JARED CHUCKLING] I gave that same speech to my friends at the gender reveal party. My one friend looked at me, he goes, â€œYou are fucking crazy.â€ He goes, â€œYou took that one thing, and you made it a whole personality.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou sound scared.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, I guess I am. Iâ€™m scared of being, like, three months dating Flipperâ€¦â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œâ€¦and having to end it for no good reason at all.â€ Thatâ€™s every relationship Iâ€™ve been in. I end it before it gets more serious. I know what would happen with her. And Iâ€™m the worst at ending relationships in the entire world. Every breakup Iâ€™ve ever had lasts a month at the minimum.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
A month! Iâ€™m so bad at it. Iâ€™ve never chosen the right day for a breakup also. Every breakup, every womanâ€™s like, â€œThree weeks after my half-birthday.â€ â€œAnd Honda Days at our local dealership is directly around the corner.â€ â€œYou know itâ€™s international Bagel day.â€ â€œMy grandmother died seven and a half years ago.â€ â€œShe loved a schmear.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™ve never chosen the right day. I break up before the next step. Thatâ€™s my biggest problem. If you break up before the next stepâ€¦ Moving in, making it, like, real, engagement. If you break up before the next step, youâ€¦ you know theyâ€™re gonna ask you why. And you donâ€™t have a good reason when you break up before the next step. All your whys are frivolous and fixable. If she was like, â€œWhy?â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œWell, when we went to Miami, you clapped when the plane landed.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œI looked at you. You were likeâ€¦â€ â€œI thought of our kids.â€ â€œYour texts also come in green. If we canâ€™tâ€¦â€ â€œIf we canâ€™t be on the same group chat, how could we live in the same home?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
When you break up, what do you have to do? You have to warn them by acting a little weird. â€˜Cause they donâ€™t know itâ€™s coming. Everythingâ€™s great. Before the next step, we should be doing the next thing. So, you act weird. You try to warn them. Itâ€™s never worked in the history of every relationship. Youâ€¦ you text less, you make less plans, right? Iâ€™ll do weird things. Iâ€™llâ€¦ Iâ€™ll give them a different name during sex.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Never works. They donâ€™t even know. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œOoh, role-play.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œUgh, fuck!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Every time Iâ€™ve acted weird, it never turns into getting dumped or a conversation. Itâ€™s just, â€œYouâ€™re acting weird!â€ And Iâ€™m always like, â€œYeah, I would dump me if I were you.â€ [CROWD LAUGHING]
And then theyâ€™re likeâ€¦ [LAUGHING NERVOUSLY] And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [LAUGHING NERVOUSLY]
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Itâ€™s so stupid â€™cause then all you got left are vague reasons. Vague reasons. And Iâ€™ve learned one thing as a man. Vague reasons arenâ€™t good enough for any woman in a breakup. You gotta have good reasons. Reasons they go to the brunch table and be like, â€œHe said he hates my grandmother.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
You need good reasons. I have vague reasons, and they never work. Itâ€™ll be like, â€œIâ€™m busy,â€ or something. You know? Or like, â€œItâ€™s not you. Itâ€™s me.â€ â€œThe timingâ€™s off.â€ And theyâ€™re like a zombie. They keep coming at me. Right? Iâ€™m a fat cop with bad aim.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Just like, â€œThe timingâ€™s off.â€ â€œWe can make time.â€ â€œItâ€™s not you. Itâ€™s me.â€ â€œItâ€™s a little bit me.â€
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
And then my friend got left by his fiancÃ©e. Right around the same time I left my ex. He called me. He goes, â€œThe weddingâ€™s off.â€ And I go, â€œWhat happened?â€ He goes, â€œShe said sheâ€™s bisexual.â€ I had just spent a month breaking up. My first thought was, â€œFuck.â€ â€œI should have said bisexual.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
It worked for her! A whole wedding canceled. But bi would only work for a woman. It could never workâ€¦ If Iâ€¦ And itâ€™s bullshit. Some of you are like. â€œThatâ€™s offensive.â€ Itâ€™s not offensive. If my girlfriend was like, â€œIâ€™m leaving because Iâ€™m bi,â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œIâ€™m still in the game here.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Bi? But biâ€™s a half-breakup, just like clapping when the plane lands, just like, â€œItâ€™s not you. Itâ€™s me.â€ If I said bi, Iâ€™d be like, â€œIâ€™m bi.â€ Sheâ€™d keep coming at me. Sheâ€™d be like, â€œLetâ€™s go suck a dick.â€ [CHUCKLING]
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œMy friend Cameron is experimenting.â€ â€œHeâ€™s got soft hands.â€ Thatâ€™s the thing you learn from every breakup before the next step. You canâ€™t turn off your girlfriend. You canâ€™t. Unturnoffable. You can turn off a woman. Thatâ€™s easy.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I didnâ€™t realize how easy it was. My friend, she went on a date. I go, â€œHow was the date?â€ She goes, â€œI had to leave early.â€ â€œI got â€˜the ick.'â€ Look, every woman here knows exactly what Iâ€™m talking about.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€¦ I didnâ€™t know. I thought she said a German word. I had no idea. I go, â€œWhatâ€™s â€˜the ick?'â€ â€œShe goes, â€˜When you go on a date, he does one thing, and you never want to fuck him ever.'â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I was like, â€œThatâ€™s the least relatable thing Iâ€™ve heardâ€¦ in my entire life.â€ I was like, â€œWhat happened?â€ She goes, â€œWe went to a park. He sat criss-cross applesauce.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
That is the least relatable thing I have everâ€¦ I have never thought that I was criss-cross applesauce away from not fucking that night. I go, â€œDoes this happen a lot?â€ She goes, â€œAll the time.â€ She goes, â€œOne time, a guy took me bowling. He did this too much.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
She goes, â€œAnother time it was raining, and he hopped over a puddle.â€ What I love about â€œthe ickâ€ is itâ€™s two people on two different pages. Heâ€™s bowling. Heâ€™s like, â€œWait till she sees that strike.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
He hops over the puddle. Heâ€™s like, â€œKept my socks dry!â€ And sheâ€™s sitting there like, â€œAnd my pussy.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m now collecting icks. I keep asking women for their icks. Iâ€™ve heard them allat this point. Tied his shoes bunny ears. Wouldnâ€™t fuck him. Scooched into a booth. On the elliptical.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
One woman said the guy went to pay for the date, and all of a sudden she heardâ€¦ [VOCALIZING] Velcro wallet.
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
I had a woman in Buffalo say to me, â€œI got â€˜the ickâ€™ â€™cause I imagined him missing a bus and chasing it.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Some of you look like you didnâ€™t follow along. He never missed the bus. That means he was like, â€œHi, Iâ€™m Josh,â€ and she was like, â€œCan you imagine this loser missing a bus?â€ I wish I had known about â€œthe ick.â€ One woman said she went swimming with a guy and he dove in badly. Every straight man wishes theyâ€™d known. I wish my summer camp counselors were like, â€œPut your hands together.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t know how important this is.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] She even onceâ€¦ What I love about â€œthe ickâ€â€¦ Iâ€™d never yuck your ick. Youâ€™re allowed to have your ick. Theyâ€™reâ€¦ theyâ€™re reasonable and unreasonable at the same time. Like, Iâ€¦ I get it, but I donâ€™t get it. Thereâ€™s some that go against everything youâ€™ve ever told men. One woman said she went ice skating with a guy. He was bad at it, so he used the penguin.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Itâ€™s like, that guyâ€™s doing everything you told us. Heâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re being vulnerable. Good for you.â€ â€œYou went to therapy for this. Good job.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
One woman said she played ping-pong. The ball got away. He chased it like that. And thatâ€™s where itâ€™s reasonable. This isnâ€™t a fuckable look for a man. I donâ€™t know a lot of women that are like, â€œYou know what makes me wet?â€ â€œWhen a man runs like a toddler for the first time.â€ But then itâ€™s unreasonable. Whatâ€™s a fuckable way to chase a ping-pong ball? Youâ€¦ you canâ€™t think of it. Whatâ€™s he supposed to do? â€œOh I got this shit, motherfucker.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] And thatâ€™s the thing. I would fuck you no matter what. A woman could be a walking ick. [CHUCKLING] A woman could come in my apartment while chasing a ping-pong ball. Farting the whole way. Justâ€¦ [JARED FLATULATING] Pick her nose, hock a loogie, use the wrong form of â€œyour.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And Iâ€™d be like, â€œWho is this angel?â€ [JARED CHUCKLING] I have no relation to â€œthe ick.â€ I understand the feeling. Like, I think I got â€œthe ickâ€, like in high school. Like when the teacher would match you with someone dumber for a group project. Right? Thatâ€™s gotta be the feeling, right? Theyâ€™re like, â€œYouâ€™re gonna be with Randy.â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œOkay.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] â€œIâ€™ll deal with Randy.â€ And then Randy forgets a pencil, is like â€œOkie dokie.â€ And youâ€™re like fâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHING]
But Iâ€™ve never gotten an ick on a date and not wanted to fuck a woman. I haveâ€¦ I have no relation to â€œthe ick.â€ Every woman in here has a strong relationship with it. Iâ€™ve gotten â€œthe oof.â€
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
You guys look as clueless as I looked. Like, â€œOof, I shouldnâ€™t have fucked that chick. Fuck.â€ â€œShe ordered milk with dinner.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œSheâ€™s unreasonable.â€ [CHUCKLING] I think about that a lot. Why do I get an oof and you get an ick? Why did â€œthe ickâ€ get such a great laugh? And â€œthe oof,â€ no laugh at all?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œThe ick,â€ you guys were into it. You guys were like, [TAUNTING] â€œWe wonâ€™t fuck those dudes.â€ Then I did â€œthe oof.â€ You guys were like, â€œThatâ€™s not very funny.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED LAUGHING] And I agree. â€œThe oofâ€ is mean. Iâ€™m not here to disagree. Youâ€™re right. But it comesâ€¦ Theyâ€™re both from fearful places, â€œthe ickâ€ and â€œthe oof.â€ Right? Iâ€™m afraid of being unsuccessful, to button up the shirt of life, miss a button, have to unbutton the shirt of life, rebutton it again. To be older, poor, divorced, in a bar, paisley shirt, New Balance shoes.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Talking to young women outside of my generation about things I donâ€™t care about or know about. Looking at a 25-year-old, like, â€œYeah, Dua Lipa slaps.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] I think a lot of men relate to that fear. [CHUCKLING] Women in my life have the opposite fear, to never button up the shirt at all. Last married, last engaged, the cat woman clichÃ©. I get that. So you deal with people like, â€œIâ€™ll give him a shot.â€ And then they ick you up.
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
I think thatâ€™s our family. I go home for the holidays I get asked, â€œAre you killing it? Are you successful? Howâ€™s work?â€ My female friends, they go home they get asked, â€œAre you dating anyone new? Got a new guy?â€ Iâ€™ve never been asked about my relationship status. Like, maybe once, I have an uncle whoâ€™s like, â€œYou fucking?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
So thatâ€™s why I break up before the next step. Iâ€™m avoiding a life oof. Iâ€™ve thought about this a lot. And I blame one group for being so fearful of oofs. Married men. Married men are the worst marketing team for marriageâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€¦that you have ever come across. Theyâ€™ll be standing next to their wives. Theyâ€™ll look young men in the eyes. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œDonâ€™t do it.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And then the wife is in on it, weirdly. Sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, Robertâ€™s so funny!â€ And then he keeps going. Heâ€™s like, â€œEvery morning is worse than the last.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And then sheâ€™s still laughing. Sheâ€™s like, â€œOh my God, heâ€™s like a comedian, just like you.â€ And then heâ€™s likeâ€¦ [LAUGHING NERVOUSLY]
[CROWD LAUGHING]
You ever watch a horror movie? They go to the gas station before the mountain theyâ€™ll get murdered on? And thereâ€™s that old guy whoâ€™s like, â€œYou donâ€™t wanna go there.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Thatâ€™s every married man Iâ€™ve ever met in my entireâ€¦ â€œDonâ€™t go to marriage mountain.â€ â€œThere ainâ€™t no blowjobs up there.â€ â€œThereâ€™s a lot of long-winded stories without an ending on that mountain.â€ â€œAnd you gotta go to bed at the same time.â€ So I was at this gender reveal party.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And Iâ€™m with all my friends who are married. Theyâ€™re happy. They do that same married dude thing. â€œNo, donâ€™t do it. I was crushing on Tinder.â€ And I know theyâ€™re happy. But theyâ€™re all, likeâ€¦ They seem like theyâ€™ve, not settled, but theyâ€™re happy where they are. Theyâ€™re with a partner, and they see good and bad, and then they go with it. I donâ€™t go with it. Thatâ€™s the problem. When youâ€™re 37 and single, you have this, like, luxury of looking ahead. And it works against you. Like, the dating apps. Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m like the Google generation. We Google everything before we go. We Google the restaurant, make sure everything on the restaurantâ€™s menu is amazing and wonderful and up our alley. We have no experiences that are below good. When you walk somewhere, you Google map the walk, even if youâ€™ve done it 1,000 times. â€œIâ€™ll get to 10K my way.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And now Iâ€™m doing that with people. I think about this. I should go to a bar. Iâ€™m talking to this woman. Sheâ€™s beautiful, smart, wonderful, funny. Suddenly sheâ€™s like, â€œI gotta go.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI didnâ€™t get your number.â€ And she gives me her number. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m Darlene.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™d be like, â€œHoly shit, Iâ€™m about to go down on a Darlene.â€ â€œI hope it tastes like pot roast.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I like the way you guys got when I said â€œgender reveal party.â€ You immediatelyâ€¦ I could hear your assholes clench up.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] Thatâ€™s my most 37-year-old opinion. I love gender reveal parties. And Iâ€™m very 37. I donâ€™t relate to any of the non-37-year-olds. Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t relate to the 37-year-olds. My college friends, I talk to them. Itâ€™s asâ€¦ itâ€™s as weird as the Dua Lipa joke. Iâ€™ll be looking them in the eyes, theyâ€™ll be like, â€œI love the lighting in a Chase Bank.â€ And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] But Iâ€™m also not trying to be younger than I am. Iâ€™m very 37. If Iâ€™m at a bar, and Iâ€™m drinking, and I see a DJ start setting upâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I react like a storm cloud is approaching the beach. Iâ€™m like, â€œPack it up. Letâ€™s go. We gotta go!â€ â€œLeave your phone. Heâ€™s white. Itâ€™s EDM. We gotta go!â€ I love gender reveal. I think itâ€™s a great idea. Iâ€¦ Iâ€™ve aged into it. Uh, listen, whatâ€¦ what parties are there left at this age?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
What, your birthday? Grow up. Your new kitchen, the backsplash? Fuck off. Think of the premise. If my friend called me, was like, â€œHey, wanna come over, get fucked up, see my life take a new direction?â€
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
â€œYes, I do.â€ I donâ€™t care what the direction is. I want more reveal parties in general. â€œHey, wanna come over, get fucked up, and see if I have diarrhea or not?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I think there should be pronoun reveal parties.
[CROWD MURMURING]
Look at â€™em. So progressive, you donâ€™t know how to fucking react.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
The pronoun discussion always goes negative. No one makes it positive. How great would that be? â€œHoly shit. They/them. Never wouldâ€™ve thought.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Something about this tells me I should move to the suburbs. Iâ€™m so jealous of the suburbs people. Donâ€™t they have the best mindset? Like, in cities, we have to deal with new things every week. New things. Everythingâ€™s problematic. Everything we gotta talk about. â€œThe rats have anxiety now.â€ I wanna be as socially removed as a woman with a six-month-old child living in the suburbs. Is thereâ€¦ Is there anyone that knows whatâ€™s going on less than her? Look at her Instagram bio. Itâ€™s always the same. â€œMother to an angel.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œWife to a prince.â€ â€œLover of Jesus and wine.â€ That woman knows thereâ€™s a sickness killing hundreds of thousands of people? Her kid is named Raisin. She has no fucking clue.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œWhat is going on?â€ Sheâ€™s living in mental Tahiti. I wish I was her. You ever see a city womanâ€™s Instagram bio? Different vibe. City women Instagram bios are screaming at you. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWe have to help this community now!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[JARED CHUCKLING] This womanâ€™s a highway away, like, â€œI love a cab.â€ Theyâ€™re just living easier mentally. Iâ€¦ I gotta have a gender reveal party. I can tell, people donâ€™t like them. I can tell, you donâ€™t like them. I can see it. Youâ€™re very city. I can feel it. But I would argue you donâ€™t hate a gender reveal party. Thatâ€™s stupid to hate a party. Thatâ€™s like hating this stool. You hate the people who throw them. That I would agree.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
The people who throw them are the least creative people in our country. Itâ€™s a very specific group. The â€œLive, Laugh, Loveâ€ section of the countryâ€¦ has taken ownership of a great party idea and theyâ€™ve ruined it with zero creativity whatsoever. They saw cake, pink or blue? â€œThatâ€™s not enough.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna take a Molotov cocktail.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œAnd Iâ€™m gonna throw it at the woods. Fuck you, California. Having a baby.â€ Thatâ€™s not a creative. Thatâ€™s an asshole. I am an artist. Iâ€™m an artist.
[WOMAN SCOFFING]
[JARED CHUCKLING]
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I do realize it would be sad for someone new to walk in right now. Me yelling at 300 people next to a Chipotleâ€¦ that Iâ€™m an artist, but I am. My gender reveal party would be creative. I would have all my friends over. Youâ€™ve met my friends without ever having met them. Youâ€™ve met versions of my friends. My friends are super alpha competitive douchebags. Youâ€™ve matched with all of my friends on Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, all of them. Theyâ€™re a shade under 5â€™8â€³.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
They went to a state school, but bragged they went to business school, as if youâ€™re blown away. As if youâ€™re like, â€œOh my God. Indiana Business. Whoa!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
[WOMAN WHOOPING] Iâ€™d have all the food, all the booze. They could choose a T-shirt. Some would have penises, some vaginas on them. That would be their team for the rest of the day. And then they compete in events. Chess, checkers, ping-pong, 3-on-3 basketball. Theyâ€™d get into it. Women on penis team would be like, â€œCome on, cocks!â€ The man on the vagina team would only eat the tacos. Licking them from the middle, eyeballing you.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I told you theyâ€™re douchebags. I told you. And if it got close, the final event will be a climbing event. One representative from each team would climb this Aggro Crag mountain. And whoever got to the top first would get to read the big reveal. The gender of my child. And by that point, everyone would be so drunk, so fucked up, theyâ€™d be like, â€œRead it!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Some woman, sheâ€™d be hammered. Sheâ€™d stagger over from the bar, sheâ€™d be like, â€œCome on.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œCock or clit?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
And whoever got there first, theyâ€™d be all out of breathâ€¦ [PANTING] â€œThe babyâ€¦ is whatever gender they choose.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œEveryone here should be ashamed of themselves.â€ â€œTodayâ€™s events have been filmed.â€ â€œA copy is being sent to your boss.â€ â€œWeâ€™ll be offering sensitivity training after the party.â€ â€œIf you think you donâ€™t need it, why didnâ€™t you choose the blank T-shirt that was offered?â€ â€œOr eat the gender-neutral foods, like the turkey sandwich?â€ â€œWe just want a better future for them!â€ â€œAlso, just kidding. We aborted.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
[CROWD CHEERING]
I told you. Iâ€™m a creative. Whatâ€™s more creative than a gender reveal party that ends with no baby?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
My wifeâ€™s on top of the crag, chugging a beer. She pulls a pillow out from under her dress. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWe got you, motherfuckers!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Your friends are like, â€œHow was the party?â€ â€œYouâ€™re not gonna fucking believe this.â€ â€œThere is no baby.â€ â€œI got a new T-shirt and a fantastic workout.â€ I like that joke.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
The only way it works is if we all share the very similar fear is that we can go to a friendâ€™s party, the lights turn on, and someone be like, â€œYouâ€™re canceled, bitch.â€ Isnâ€™t that crazy that we all have the same fear, that we could be canceled by a friend? To laugh at something so stupid? Iâ€™m here tonight to tell you not to worry. No one in this room will ever be canceled. [WOMAN WHOOPING] One person believes me.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Weâ€™re good. No one here. Only successful people get canceled.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
What would they take from us? Your Kohlâ€™s Cash? Your Spirit Airlines points? Cancelling is when us normals take the successfuls down from the heavens and make them live our lives. Your life is the most horrific thing that could ever happen to Kim Kardashian.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Sheâ€™d be like, â€œFly commercial now!â€ â€œThe cheapest Uber, please!â€ [JARED CHUCKLING] People get weird when theyâ€™re not gonna get canceled. Iâ€™ve thought about it. Whatâ€™s the worst thing Iâ€™ve ever done? What would get me canceled? About two years agoâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€¦I masturbated at a hotel in Richmond, Virginia. Okay, some of youâ€¦ [CHUCKLING]
[CROWD LAUGHING]
It wasnâ€™t the lobby. They werenâ€™t like, â€œChecking in?â€ â€œYeah, let me get my credit caâ€¦â€ [SHOUTING]
[CROWD LAUGHING]
It was in my room. And when I came to, I realized the curtains were wide-open. Other rooms could see into my room. I got anxious. What if someone saw, pulled out their phone, started taping? Who would report on such a story?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
What group is mobilized to cancel me from that story? Whatâ€™s even the headline? â€œLittle-known comedianâ€¦ sweats from masturbation.â€ â€œSo out of shape, his Apple Watch asked if he went for a walk.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
This isnâ€™t me saying I like cancellation. I hate when it happens to millennials. Iâ€™m a millennial. If youâ€™re a millennial, Iâ€™m sure you hate it too. â€˜Cause millennials, we got fucked.
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
Editor for Teen Vogue, sheâ€™s right around my age, okay? She had old tweets come out. She got fired from Teen Vogue because old tweets were found by Gen Z kids. Gen Z canceling millennial? Fuck off.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Thatâ€™s not fair. Gen Z was brought up with this future in mind. Their whole lives, â€œDonâ€™t tweet, donâ€™t post, donâ€™t take the picture.â€ I think that was a nursery rhyme for them.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I was in college taking a shit off the second-floor landingâ€¦ of my fraternity. Looking at my buddy, being like, â€œTake a picture!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œYeah, post it on Facebook!â€ â€œThis is hilarious.â€ â€œWait â€™till the shit comes out. Tag it as my ex.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
We werenâ€™t warned. Millennial warnings have aged so fucking badly. â€œDonâ€™t get in a strangerâ€™s van.â€ You know how I got here tonight? A strangerâ€™s fucking van. I even ate the candy.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
The most annoying thing that was said to me at the gender reveal partyâ€¦
[CROWD CHUCKLING]
I had one friend that told me, and I hate this advice. â€œYou gotta love yourselfâ€¦ before you can love someone else.â€ That is the biggest, hottest garbage take. All these people in relationships love themselves?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Have they looked at themselves? They love themselves. Iâ€™m not getting there. I donâ€™t know about you. Like, I love myself 100%. Boy, this crowd feels like they really love themselves.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™ve been trying to lose ten pounds my whole life. If you laughed at that, weâ€™re immediately connected. If you didnâ€™t laugh at that, I donâ€™t know what you think about on a daily basis.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
True story. I was born on a Thursday. Then Friday, I look at my mom, and I was like, â€œOkay, we start Monday.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œItâ€™s enough of the titty milk. We gotta have oneâ€¦ one more fun weekend, then we gotta get out of the stroller, we gotta be more active.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And I know I look fine. I know that, like, thereâ€™s a guy in here where Iâ€™m his goal weight. I know. [JARED CHUCKLING] Heâ€™s looking at me like, â€œUgh, I looked like a high school wrestling coach.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I understand that. But everyone here has body issues. We all did the same thing tonight. All of us got dressed the same way. We put on a shirt, looked in the mirror while standing in a way we have never stood before. I put this shirt on. I was like, â€œWhoa, youâ€™re ready, man.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œLook at that. Flat stomach, no neck.â€ â€œEars touching shoulders. Thatâ€™s how you stand all the time.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€¦ I know what to eat, but Iâ€™ll never eat healthy. I just know that. Like, Iâ€¦ Iâ€™ll never be healthy. I hate healthy people. I think theyâ€™re annoying. Right? And thereâ€™s no straight male support for losing weight. No one cares. Right? Thereâ€™s no forums. Thereâ€™s no websites or community. I went on Reddit. Theyâ€™re not very nice there.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I told my brother I felt fat. He laughed right in my face. If a woman says she feels fat, a prayer group opens up. Go look outside of a Lululemon. Youâ€™ll see women justâ€¦ [VOCALIZING] A woman could go to the woods and be like, â€œI feel fat.â€ All her friends would show up. If I went to the woods, like, â€œI feel fat,â€ one of my buddies would pop out, be like, â€œAnd you got titties.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™ll never be a healthy person. They look ridiculous. Theâ€¦ the big water bottle people can go fuck themselves. Those are the judgiest monsters Iâ€™ve ever seen. Doesnâ€™t it feel like you could never drink as much water as them? They pull up casually. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh, you donâ€™t hydrate? Youâ€™re justâ€¦â€ â€œYouâ€™re just a fat piece of shit pig loser?â€ â€œYou gotta hydrate. Look at us the times of the day.â€ â€œ9:00 a.m., Iâ€™m better than you. 10:00 a.m., Iâ€™m better than you.â€ â€œ11:01, I pee. 11:02, I pee. 11:03, I pee. 11:04, I pee.â€ Itâ€™s the casual nature of a very not casual bottle that bothers me. They pull up like itâ€™s nothing. â€œYeah, just got back from Tulum.â€ â€œThey didnâ€™t even make me check it. Itâ€™s my emotional support hydro flask.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Thisâ€¦ they bought this because something bad happened in their lives. This was bought instead of therapy. This is whatâ€™s going on. And they never admit to that. I met my friend. She was dragging it. I thought she won the Stanley Cup. She was like, â€œHi!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œHey!â€ Just explain it. Just tell me. â€œHey, I called my boss â€˜Momâ€™ by accident.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œI bought this on Amazon just in case.â€ Like, â€œHey, I slept over at a guyâ€™s place.â€ â€œI tried to fart, a little doody came out, so I bought this.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m a drinker. Thatâ€™s a big issue. Iâ€™m a big drinker. Iâ€¦ I used to black out. Anybody a blackout person?
[CROWD CHEERING]
Okay. Some of you are sitting with someone. Like, â€œYou gonna speak up?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I used to blackout. Now I drink less so I brownout. Do we know the difference? Blackout, you wake up and remember nothing. Brownout, you remember little things throughout the day. Much fucking worse.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€˜Cause those memories are coming. You donâ€™t know when. Itâ€™ll be the next day, ordering lunch, â€œIâ€™ll have a chickenâ€¦ Fuck.â€ â€œOh God. I said the word â€˜vivaciousâ€™ last night.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œDid I tell a woman I can pull off capris?â€ I know what to eat. I just never eat it. I can make any meal healthy after Iâ€™ve eaten it.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Ever market a meal to yourself? I ate a whole pizza once, the words came out of me. I ate a whole pizza. I went, â€œDonâ€™t worry, it was a thin crust.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I can do that with any meal. Milkshake? â€œDairyâ€™s good.â€ Chicken fingers? â€œProtein.â€ Bottle of wine? â€œGreat for the heart.â€ Line of Adderall? â€œI had to focus.â€ Look, I think everything in Trader Joeâ€™s is healthy just because itâ€™s at Trader Joeâ€™s. There isnâ€™t one Trader Joeâ€™s item I would believe to be unhealthy. Trader Joeâ€™s could have a lasagna pie cookie cake, and Iâ€™d be holding it like, â€œWow. All natural.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œFucking TJâ€™s did it again.â€ I switched from Reeseâ€™s to Justinâ€™s, and I thought Iâ€™d have abs. Okay, thatâ€™s a disposable income joke.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
If you understood that joke, you have money. Good for you. If you didnâ€™t get that joke, good luck with the gas prices.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
My true addiction is nighttime eating. Itâ€™s a weird addiction because usually, addictions donâ€™t get whooed. Anything where, if you donâ€™t get it, you become a different person, thatâ€™s an addiction to me. Definitely addicted to nighttime eating. Been doing it my whole life. If youâ€™re a nighttime eater, youâ€™ve been doing the same things as me. Sneaking downstairsâ€¦ making a pu pu platter of every snack in the house. The weirdest combinations of foods. Handful of Triscuits, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, dollop of hummus, one slice of cheese.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And then you take that pu pu platter, you bring it upstairs. Youâ€™re happy as can be. Like a Sonic waitress, youâ€™re walking up.
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
You get in your room. You go, â€œThatâ€™s enough. Thatâ€™s your snack. Youâ€™re done.â€ And then you do that cycle 30 times throughout the night. Right? Down the stairs, pu pu platter, up the stairs, pep talk. Down the stairs, pu pu platter, up the stairs, pep talk. Youâ€™re like a mouse sneaking around the house. Youâ€™re Fatatouille, sneaking around all night long.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I love talking about nighttime eating, â€™cause I can see whoâ€™s connecting with me. I see the nighttime eaters. I see it in your eyes. Weâ€™re connecting in a wild way. I can feel it. Because you do exactly what I do. I can see it. Thereâ€™s also some of you who donâ€™t nighttime eat, and youâ€™re here too.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
We call you assholes. Because youâ€™re the ones weâ€™re sneaking around from. Isnâ€™t that sad? Someone you love canâ€™t trust you with who they really are? I watched some of you poke your partner in the most vulnerable spot on their body. Youâ€™re like, â€œHeâ€™s talking about you, you fat fuck!â€ Thereâ€™s nothing more embarrassing than getting caught by someone when youâ€™re a nighttime eater. Right? Itâ€™s just you in the glow of the fridge.
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
They ask you questions that you donâ€™t have an answer for. I was ten years old. My mom caught me. She goes, â€œDidnâ€™t you eat dinner?â€ I was like â€œYou were there, bitch.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
She goes, â€œWhy didnâ€™t you eat enough?â€ â€œMaybe you didnâ€™t make enough!â€ â€œI could have child services on the line in two seconds.â€ You wanna boogie?
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I didnâ€™t realize it was an addiction until the pandemic. I was staying with my parents in Boca. Jews?
And thenâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
The Jews know Boca. Iâ€¦ [CHUCKLING] I love bringing up Boca during shows, â€™cause Jews know it right away in some places and donâ€™t know it at all in other places. I said that same thing in Springfield, Missouri. I go, â€œI was in Boca. Jews?â€ And one guy in a cowboy hat stood up and went, â€œWhat the fuck is Boca?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
And I was like, â€œThatâ€™s where we control the weather from, sir.â€ I love going to Boca. Itâ€™s my favorite place in the world. I love being around older Jewish women. Thatâ€™s my favorite group.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
The best complainers in the world. Iâ€™ve watched every Karen video. Iâ€™ve watched every one. You know, those Karen videos? White, Midwestern ladies yelling at Walmart employees. After every single one, I had the same thought, as a Jew. Amateur hour.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
They were complaining at people. Thatâ€™s not how Jews complain. Jews complain at people they know, and then above the treeline of the people they donâ€™t know. Thatâ€™s how my mom does it. My mom once walked into a hotel. I was in the lobby. She didnâ€™t see me. She walks in. She goes, â€œFreezing!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And then my dad walked up beside her. She goes, â€œYouâ€™re wearing those pants!â€ And then there was a line at check-in. She goes, â€œThe line!â€ It was a complaint sniper took out the whole fucking room. It was like complaint Rambo with a fire torch, likeâ€¦ [VOCALIZING] I was hiding. I was like, â€œI think sheâ€™s out of ammo.â€ I got up. Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou look heavy.â€ I was like, â€œOw, got me!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I look to Jewish women in times of need. I was at the Delta Sky Club at JFK. The people who like the Justinâ€™s joke will understand.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m at the Delta Sky Club at JFK. Thereâ€™s an escalator that goes up to the front desk at the Delta Sky Club at JFK. I get up there at 6:00 a.m. Thereâ€™s no one there. I get it. Theyâ€™re short on staff, much like all companies are short on staff. I wait. 30 minutes later, me and 20 other people, everyone did the same thing. They got up the escalator, saw nobody was there, pulled off, waited politely. All of a suddenâ€¦ Older Jewish woman comes up the escalator. I saw her, legitimately thought to myself, â€œOh thank goodness.â€ Sheâ€™ll complain.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I am not exaggerating even an ounce. She got one step off the escalator, she goes, â€œWhatâ€™s happening?!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
That woman is my Batman. That was like I took a flashlight, shined it at the Moon. There was an outline of a bagel and lox. Karen Goldstein came surfing in on matzah. And she did the same thing as my mom. Just went to complain. â€œWhatâ€™s happening?! Who leaves the desk at this hour?!â€ â€œHow does someone take a shit for this long?!â€ And then she looks right at me. Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou look heavy!â€ I was like, â€œOw! Got me again. Fuck!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I never thought that story would offend anyone. And I told it in Washington, DC. A woman stood up. She goes, â€œWhat about Greek women?â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I was like, â€œWhat do you mean?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWeâ€™re good complainers too!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And I go, â€œWell, you standing up at a show and yelling at me kind of throws your hat into the ring.â€ And sheâ€™s right. Who am I to say that Jews are the best complainers in the world? We need to have an older woman complaining Olympics. Invite them all. Weâ€™ll invite her yaya. Your aunties, your tÃ­as, your nonnas. Your bubbies. Weâ€™ll put them all in a hot restaurant.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Whoever makes the hostess cry firstâ€¦ wins. Iâ€™m honestly interested. I wanna see how women complain around the world. I would love to see how older women complain in every country. I wanna have a travel show. I wanna go country to country. Donâ€™t you wonder? What does a German woman complain about? What? Probably Jews, but Iâ€¦ So I was in Boca when I figured out that I was addicted to nighttime eating. â€˜Cause I was staying with my parents during the pandemic. My parents have a house and a separated pool house. Weâ€™re very rich.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
The rumors of my people are true. So itâ€™s 2:00 a.m. Iâ€™m gonna do my thing. Pu pu platter. Fatatouille. Letâ€™s fucking go.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I go outside. I go to the house. I go to the side door. Locked. The front-door. Locked. The back door. Locked. Go back to the front door. New codeâ€¦ [BEEPING] Locked. My first reaction was, â€œThat fucking bitch.â€ And Iâ€™m talking about my mom. I love my mom. I donâ€™t talk about her that way. Thatâ€™s an addict. Iâ€™ve become a different person. Whoâ€™s wrong in that scenario? The woman who locked her doors, or me, a half naked, 37-year-old man, who is now storming the perimeterâ€¦ of a home? It was January 6. I had the wolves hat on. I had a lacrosse stick in my hand. Iâ€™m like, â€œGimme that Pirateâ€™s Booty, motherfucker.â€ â€œCaramelized onion dip! Slice of cheese!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
You might not be a nighttime eater, but youâ€™re probably a drunk eater. Iâ€™m even worse when Iâ€™m drunk. Iâ€¦ I took six months off of drinking â€™cause I drunk eat. Thatâ€™s the worst reason to stop drinking. I canâ€™t go to AA with that story.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
AA, I imagine, they have amazing stories. What would I say? â€œJared, whatâ€™s your tale?â€ â€œI get a little hungry.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™ll never forget the worst I ever got was Dallas, Texas. I got so fucked up. So fucked up. It was a show. Hot show. I leave. I go to Postmates. I donâ€™t care what delivery app you use. I use Postmates. All I need from my delivery app is a cartoon vehicle that I can followâ€¦ from restaurant to mouth. Thatâ€™s when you know you have an emotional issue with food, when that cartoon vehicle holds your whole status within it. Right? If it takes a wrong turn, Iâ€™m sitting there, â€œNo, no, no, no!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œNo, no, no, no, no, no!â€ I reactâ€¦ If that takes a certainâ€¦ Itâ€™s like bringing my new heart for a transplant. I am fucked up by that bike. Iâ€™m watching the bike, the bike idles. I get a text. â€œYour orderâ€™s been canceled by the restaurant.â€
[CROWD MUTTERING]
Appropriate response.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I was distraught. I was in the lobby of the hotel. Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck this. Fucking garbage. Fucking town.â€ â€œWho the fuckâ€¦ This fucking restaurant.â€ All of a sudden, Iâ€™m outside. I donâ€™t even know how I got there. [CROWD LAUGHING]
I open up Google Maps. Thereâ€™s a McDonaldâ€™s .3 miles away. I saw that, immediately started running. Iâ€™m now running to get food. Do we see how bad this has gotten? Iâ€™m exercising to eat late night, the sucking-dick-for-crack of my addiction.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m running towards the McDonaldâ€™s. The Golden Arches are coming at me. Thereâ€™s a homeless woman outside. Sheâ€™s freaking the fuck out. Sheâ€™s going, â€œMcDonald! Micky D! McDonald! Micky D!â€ She was like a homeless rooster.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m not trying to minimize homelessness. Itâ€™s a huge issue in the whole country. But Iâ€™m also not fixing it that night.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€˜Cause I got close to her. I juked the fuck out of her. I broke that bitchâ€™s ankles. [CHUCKLING] I threw a quarter over my shoulder. I was like, â€œGood luck!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I go to the side door of the McDonaldâ€™s. Locked. Iâ€™m back in Boca.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
I freak out the homeless woman the same way I did my mom. â€œThat homeless bitch!â€ And then I see that the drive-thru is still operating. I saw my reflection in the window of that McDonaldâ€™s that night. I said, â€œJared, youâ€™re walking through the drive-thru.â€ I donâ€™t know who here has walked through a drive-thru before.
[CROWD WHOOPING]
There are my alcoholics. Thank you. Right. â€˜Cause Youâ€™ve never walked through a drive-thru at a high point in life. Itâ€™s never, â€œGot my tie on. Got my briefcase.â€ â€œJust gonna hoof it on through for some Egg McMuffs before the big promosh!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
No. When you walk through a drive-thru, youâ€™re fucked up. I started doing weird stuff to fit in. Making myself big. â€œNothing to see here.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY]
â€œJust a Mini Cooper.â€ The guy in front of me looked in his rearview mirror. I explained myself to him. He couldnâ€™t even hear me. Iâ€™m like, â€œThe kids woke up.â€ â€œGetting â€™em Happy Meals. Iâ€™m a cool dad!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
So thereâ€™s two speakers that lead to one line. We all understand the config. I go to the outside speaker. I go, â€œHello!â€ â€œMcDonaldâ€™s!â€ No oneâ€™s answering. Iâ€™m so fucked up, Iâ€™m like, â€œMaybe the sensors canâ€™t see me â€™cause Iâ€™m not a Ford F-150.â€ So I back up to get big, to trip off sensors that I donâ€™t even know if they exist. I just made them up. And Iâ€™m not sure if theyâ€™re in the sky or the ground, so Iâ€™m going â€œHello!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œMcDonaldâ€™s!â€ At this moment, the homeless woman goes to the other speaker. She starts screaming, â€œMcDonald! Micky D! McDonald! Micky D!â€ So now we have a rooster and an eagle. I see her. I freak out. Iâ€™m like, â€œGet the fuck outta here!â€ â€œYouâ€™re ruining everything! They think youâ€™re crazy!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Itâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re crazy.â€ â€œNo, no, no, Jared, weare now crazy.â€ People in McDonaldâ€™s looking out the window, like, â€œOh my God, thereâ€™s two of them now.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
â€œGuys, thereâ€™s a bum fight. Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I think oneâ€™s a newer bum.â€ â€œHe looks like the coach of the high school wrestling team.â€ â€œIs he Jewish? Oh my God, the pandemicâ€™s been hard on everyone, apparently.â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
So then I ran away. I ran away. She chased me. Iâ€™m not exaggerating. Sheâ€™s going, â€œHey!â€ I go, â€œGet the fuck away!â€ She goes, â€œHey!â€ I go, â€œWhat?â€ She goes, â€œYou look heavy.â€ â€œOw! Got me again. Fuck!â€
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Iâ€™m Jared Freid. Thank you guys so much.
[CROWD CHEERING]
Thank you all for coming.
[FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING]
[JARED] Thank you, thank you, thank you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Look at this dungy place. Every place is that. I wouldnâ€™t stay there at The Standard anymore. You donâ€™t like it there? Every hotel here? This is another thing. This is another thing. Itâ€™s crowdâ€¦ The line was so crazy. I said, â€œItâ€™s Christmastime. Itâ€™s very busy.â€
Itâ€™s not Christmastime.
Now he says itâ€™s not Christmastime.
Itâ€™s like, do you live on the beach?
Right. On the beach. Mommy thinks these people are in New York because of Christmas.
Yes.
Not yet.
[JARED] Times Square.
Not yet. He goes, â€œItâ€™s not Christmastime.â€
When are the Rockettes here?
Theyâ€™re here now. I wouldâ€™ve liked to have gone.
It is. Well, thatâ€™s the truth.
Five-deep at Katzâ€™s. â€œDo you wantâ€¦ What kind of diet soda?â€ â€œI donâ€™t care.â€ How simple is that? This is why I brought you. To keep my stress down. She knows I like diet cherry. I am waiting in line, trying to order, and sheâ€™s yelling, â€œHave them melt some melted Muenster.â€ They put mustard in it. â€œNo, I want mayonnaise. Do my bread again.â€ You guys should go on stage and talk about your Katzâ€™s experience to open up. They never saw a show like Dad and I. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] The proud parent. Dad does something with his mouth.
What does he do?
Smile. No, he laughs while you take a picture. He goesâ€¦ Heâ€™s not natural. [JARED GIGGLING]
Jared, you took the worst ones.
What am I supposed to do?
[MAN] Thatâ€™s not what we look like.
[JARED] Thatâ€™s notâ€¦ Yeah. One more? Okay. Open your eyes.
[MAN] I look extremely relaxed.
Yeah. I canâ€™t. Go do Dad. Dad looks good.
Get rid of those.
[JARED] Okay.
What you doing?
Yeah, I think the bachelors are coming. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Well, have fun.
Do you want a beer?
Here comes your makeup, Jared. Bring a couple beers in case someone comes back here. Okay, cool.
[JARED] Thatâ€™s good. Thank you.
I told them make you look tan.

[â™ª theme music playing]
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Gaffigan!
[audience cheering]
Thank you! Thank you, Tampa! Thank you. Thank you, Tampa. Americaâ€™s next great city!
[audience cheers]
All right. It is so great to be here. [scoffs] Who am I kidding? I donâ€™t need this. Right? Iâ€¦ Let me take it off. Okay. Here we go.
[laughter]
[grunts]
[audience cheers]
All right, here it comesâ€¦ Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s why some of you are here.
[laughter]
Now, before you think Iâ€™m all paranoid, the only reason Iâ€™m wearing this is because I have COVID. [coughs] And by the end of the show, so will most of these people. [coughs] How many of you got COVID? Did you get COVID? -Did you getâ€“?
[audience cheering]
Thatâ€™s â€™cause youâ€™re filthy! And God doesnâ€™t love you.
[laughter]
No, I got COVID. God, when was that? That was, uh, this afternoon.
[laughter]
But I prayed it away.
[laughter]
I do not have COVID. Actually, I was just tested. I took one of those online tests.
[laughter]
Sent â€™em an empath, and I have monkey pox.
[laughter]
Monkeypox kind of sounds like a kidâ€™s cereal. Itâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s the prize inside?â€ Sex with men.
[laughter]
What a weird couple of years weâ€™ve had. My God! Lockdowns, mandates, variants. But it feels like weâ€™ve finally gotten to the point where we donâ€™t care.
[laughter]
Right? Remember what we used to care? [scattered applause] I mean, obviously, we care, but we used to be concerned. We were like, â€œHundreds of people have died today,â€ and now weâ€™re like, â€œHundreds of people have died today. Letâ€™s go to a comedy show.â€
[laughter]
Right?
[cheers and applause]
For two years, for two years, the news was like the death lottery. We sat at home watching, like it was Powerball. Hereâ€™s tonightâ€™s numbers. [high-pitched voice] â€œHoney, get out here. Itâ€™s about to reach two million! Honey?â€ [comical voice] â€œSome of his jokes were sad.â€ Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re all vaccinated or gonna die.
[laughter]
We all know some anti-vaxxers, and some of us used to know an anti-vaxxer.
[laughter]
Strange how thatâ€™s funny, right? Youâ€™re like, â€œHa ha, they died! Ha ha ha!â€ There was a shift in our empathy during the pandemic. I think it was those anti-vax preachers. Remember reading about them, youâ€™re like, â€œâ€˜Anti-vax preacher dies of COVID.â€™ Good.â€ I can say that â€™cause Iâ€™m a Christian.
[laughter]
People make their own decisions. We had no control over it. My parents, my parents arenâ€™t vaccinated. I mean, theyâ€™ve been dead for a couple decades, butâ€¦ [laughter] Enough with the excuses, right? The pandemic did make me contemplate my mortality. I just know when I go, I want it over quick. Like if Iâ€™m in a plane crash, I want the plane to explode mid-air. I was reading about this one plane crash. This plane was flying at 30,000 feet, 30,000 feet, and then it started a nosedive. The plane nosedived for three minutes. Three minutes! Brutal! Thatâ€™s a long time! You know, for the first minute, everyone on that plane was like, [screaming] But eventuallyâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦after like 60 seconds, they were likeâ€¦ [screaming, then slowing down]
[laughter]
â€œDoes anyone have any water?
[laughter]
I didnâ€™t really pace out my dying scream.â€ Three minutes. Thatâ€™s a long time. You know someone on that plane rang the flight attendant button.
[laughter]
Ding! â€œDo you know how long till we crash?
[laughter]
Does this mean I can get a free drink? Thatâ€™s long enough for passengers to get on each otherâ€™s nerves. â€œWhen you scream, can you not grab my armrest?â€ Look, Iâ€™ll kill you before we even crash.â€ Maybe the pilot came over the intercom. â€œHey, everyone, itâ€™s your captain here. â€œJust wanted to thank you for choosing to fly with us. Special shout out to our Silver Medallion members.
[laughter]
â€œYou would have earned 2,000 miles on todayâ€™s flight, but it looks like weâ€™re not going to quite reach 700.
[laughter]
Our flight attendant Betty has been with the airline for 31 years, and it appears today is her last day.
[laughter]
You can go ahead and take your phone off of airplane mode.
[laughter]
Heck, Iâ€™ve taken the plane off of airplane mode.
[laughter]
At this point, weâ€™re just a metal box hurling towards the earth. We should have you back on the ground in about seven seconds.â€ Is that too dark? Itâ€™s gonna get worse. Right?
[cheers and applause]
â€˜Cause that was the lesson of the pandemic. Itâ€™s inevitable. Eventually weâ€™re all gonna go. Donâ€™t worry, not all my materialâ€™s this uplifting. But weâ€™re all gonna go, and then our loved ones will do our funeral. Thatâ€™s harsh, right? The people closest to the deceased are put in charge. Itâ€™s like, â€œWe know youâ€™re in a very vulnerable state, but time to host a party.â€
[laughter]
Theyâ€™re in shock. Everyone at a funeralâ€™s in shock. If youâ€™re not a little surprised at a funeral, youâ€™re the murderer.
[laughter]
â€œIt was so unexpected.â€ â€œNot for me.â€
People are caught off guard at a funeral. But I want my funeral to be a total surprise. Like when I die, I donâ€™t want anyone to be told. I just want evites to go out to friends. â€œLast-minute party. Come on over, big announcement.â€ And then when my friends arrive, â€œJimâ€™s dead.â€ [shudders] â€œIs there anything I can do?â€ â€œCome look at the body.â€ â€˜Cause thatâ€™s essentially what happens at funerals. â€œCome look at the dead body.â€ â€œIâ€™ll take your word for it. What is this, Weekend at Bernieâ€™s?â€
[laughter]
Have you been to an open-casket funeral? â€œHis memory will live onâ€¦ in my nightmares.â€
[laughter]
At Catholic funerals, youâ€™re supposed to kneel next to the casket and say a prayer. That prayer goes like this: â€œOne-Mississippi, two-Mississippiâ€¦
[laughter]
Itâ€™s got to be long enough.â€
[applause]
â€˜Cause the body looks weird in the casket. It does. Theyâ€™re always overdressed. We put men in business suits. What, do they have an interview?
[laughter]
Dress for the afterlife you want. People usually say, â€œHe looks like heâ€™s resting.â€ â€œOr he passed out at an office Christmas party. Why is he wearing a tie?â€ If you want me to rest in peace, bury me in pajamas.
[laughter]
In preparation for the funeral, we put makeup on the dead body. â€œWhen did Grandpa start wearing eyeliner?â€ Thereâ€™s special funeral makeup. You never see commercials for that makeup. â€œMaybe that corpse is still aliveâ€¦ or maybe itâ€™s Maybelline.
[laughter]
For when you want to look drop-dead gorgeous.â€
[laughter]
Thatâ€™s someoneâ€™s job, to put makeup on a dead personâ€™s face. That couldnâ€™t have been the goal. Somehow the dream of â€œI want to work in fashionâ€ became â€œIâ€™ll put blush on the corpse.â€
[laughter]
It is an art form. Itâ€™s impressive. Iâ€™m surprised thereâ€™s not a reality show. Pimp My Corpse.
[laughter]
I have my own idea for a reality show. I think itâ€™s a winner. Let me pitch it to you. My show would open with two identical bodies lying next to each other. One of the bodies would be dead. The other, cake. Right? This showâ€™s called Dead or Cake. And then a loved one would be given a cake knife. â€œSusie loved her grandma, but how well did she know her? Will she cut into the delicious red velvet cake, or her nana?
[laughter]
Letâ€™s find out. Susie, You may cut theâ€“ Oh, Susie.â€
[laughter]
This is usually the point when people ask, â€œWell, whenâ€™s he going to do the food jokes? I thought he was gonnaâ€“â€ â€œDead or Cake is a food joke.â€
Funerals are weird. Open casket, closed casket. I want to be sitting up in my casket. You know, just sitting there.
[laughter]
Eyes open. Iâ€™d like to be positioned near the doorway, so when people enter the room, theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat the hell?â€
[laughter]
Iâ€™d rig it so occasionally my hand would go up. Iâ€™d definitely want there to be crumbs on my chest. â€œDid he eat recently?â€ Iâ€™d pre-record an announcement: â€œThanks for coming to my funeral. Donâ€™t be sad. Iâ€™m in a better place. Just kidding. Iâ€™m right here.â€
[laughter]
And then I donâ€™t know if this is in poor taste, but at that moment, Iâ€™d like my body to burst into flames. I want to be cremated, but at my funeral. You know, something for everyone, a little surf and turf. Weâ€™ve all been to funerals. Weâ€™ve all lost someone. Still had their number in our phone. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to delete it, but theyâ€™re never gonna call. It would be weird if they did. â€œGrandma?â€ â€œStop looking at that filth on the Internet.â€
[laughter]
We lost my aunt several years ago, and eventually someone else was assigned her phone number, and we know that because my aunt was part of our family text chain. And at one point, a random guy chimed in, kind of annoyed, â€œWhy am I part of this text chain?â€ So I responded the only way I could, I said, â€œâ€˜Cause youâ€™re my aunt and we love you.â€ And he was like, â€œBro, Iâ€™m not your aunt.â€ And I was like, â€œYou havenâ€™t changed a bit.
[laughter]
What a character, right?â€ Each culture has their own ritual to deal with loss. I think the Mexicans do it best. They have Dia de Muertos, which means Day of the Dead. I bet you didnâ€™t know I was bilingual. Day of the Dead is a celebration of the life of the person they lost. And they got this from the Aztecs. Supposedly, the Aztecs would go all in. Once a year, the Aztecs would visit the grave of a loved one, dig up the body, clean the bones, and then eat a meal with the skeleton. And I just feel like my mom wouldnâ€™t want that.
[laughter]
Where are the local authorities? â€œWhat in the hell are you doing?â€ â€œWell, I was having dinner with my mom until you rudely interrupted.â€ Donâ€™t worry, I can say that â€™cause Iâ€™m Aztec.
[laughter]
The most famous Aztec, of course, is Montezuma. You may have heard of Montezumaâ€™s revenge. If youâ€™re in Mexico and you get diarrhea, thatâ€™s Montezumaâ€™s revenge. Montezuma had the ability to give other people diarrhea. That was like his superpower. â€œYou get diarrhea, you get diarrhea.â€ He was like the Oprah of diarrhea. â€œEveryone look under your seats! Youâ€™re all going home with diarrhea!â€
[laughter]
What a bizarre power, to give someone diarrhea. I donâ€™t know if he was part of the Marvel universe. â€œMontezuma, reporting for dutyâ€¦ and doody.â€
[laughter]
You know, Iâ€™d always heard that the best revenge is a life well lived. But, I donâ€™t know, giving your enemy diarrheaâ€™s got to be up there. We all know someone weâ€™d like to give diarrhea to. â€œOh, Carol wants me to work this weekend? Well, looks like sheâ€™s not doing anything, either.
[laughter]
Thanks, Montezuma.â€ That was Montezumaâ€™s revenge, which is not that harsh when you consider what itâ€™s revenge for. Did Montezuma give a rousing speech? Was he like, â€œThey may kill us all. They may wipe out our civilization, but we shall have our revenge.â€ And the Aztecs are like, â€œWhat is it? What is it?â€ â€œDiarrhea.â€ And the Aztecs are like, â€œIt sounded like you said diarrhea.â€ â€œBut hereâ€™s the kicker. Theyâ€™d be on vacation.â€ And the Aztecs are like, â€œWhatâ€™s a vacation?â€ Itâ€™s a unique form of revenge. You never see that in one of those Liam Neeson movies. [deep voice] â€œI have a very particular set of skills. And if anything should happen to my daughter, you will find yourself with IBS.
[laughter]
That stands for irritable bowel syndrome. Itâ€™s a fancy term for diarrhea.â€ Now, I know thatâ€™s a ridiculous amount of diarrhea jokes. But, I donâ€™t know, I feel like I can say them â€™cause I have diarrhea. I do. I always have diarrhea. I donâ€™t mean to brag, butâ€¦ I have ADHD: always does have diarrhea. Every day for me is Dia de Diarrhea. And Iâ€™m sure some of you are thinking, â€œOh, Jimâ€™s just saying that to impress the ladies.â€ And there might be a gal out there, â€œI want to hook up with the diarrhea comic.â€ Well, too bad, â€™cause Iâ€™m taken. And I have diarrhea. Diarrhea comes from the Greek word â€œdia,â€ meaning God and â€œrheaâ€, meaning I have diarrhea. Now, Iâ€™m faced with the challenge of segueing back to normal materialâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦after what can only be described as an explosion of diarrhea jokes. Starbucks? You ever go to Starbucks? It worked. It totally worked. Starbucks, of course, is a coffee shop. But much more than that, right? Starbucks is a whole experience, and that whole Starbucks experience makes me want to strangle people.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m convinced, humans, we canâ€™t handle Starbucks. Thereâ€™s too many options. Way too many options. In fast food places, thereâ€™s an efficiency. â€œIâ€™ll have a number three.â€ And Starbucks, people sound like brats. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOkay. Letâ€™s see. What does baby feel like sipping on? Iâ€™ll have a venti half-caf caramel macchiato with no sugar, no dairy, and no coffee.â€
[laughter]
Then the most amazing thing happens. Instead of the Starbucks cashier slapping this person, they just give a nod of, â€œAs you wish.â€ It appears like people in Starbucks are trying to stump the barista. Theyâ€™re like, â€œAll right, let me have a chai tea with shot of pumpkin spice, half goat milk and half breast milk.â€
[laughter]
â€œAs you wish.â€ Your order in Starbucks is not complete until you provide a name. And they donâ€™t really ask for it, they kind of demand it. Theyâ€™re like, â€œI need a name for the order.â€ â€œCan I just have my coffee?â€ â€œI must have a name.â€ [sighs] â€œSatan.â€ â€œExcuse me?â€ â€œTall black coffee. Satan.â€
[laughter]
â€œAs you wish.â€ The suffering doesnâ€™t end there, though. After you order, then you have to wait in that pickup area. Thatâ€™s like the methadone clinic of Starbucks. All the caffeine addicts are milling aroundâ€¦ Youâ€™re forced to listen to Mannheim Steamroller.
[â™ª scatting â€œCarol of the Bellsâ€]
You just judge other peopleâ€™s orders. â€œI have a hot chocolate for Dan.â€ â€œWhat a dork. Grow up, Dan!â€ And if Danâ€™s not right there, youâ€™re like, â€œWe should kill Dan.â€
[laughter]
You just wait. You wait, as the people that ordered on the Starbucks app breeze in like theyâ€™re accepting an award.
[â™ª scatting â€œCarol of the Bellsâ€]
â€œSee you losers later.â€
[â™ª scatting â€œCarol of the Bellsâ€]
You just end up watching that barista slave away. Youâ€™ve never seen someone work that hard in your life, but you wish theyâ€™d pick up the pace a little.
[laughter]
â€œCome on!â€ You want your coffee, but more than anything, you need to get away from these people. Occasionally thereâ€™s that person that brings their own cup to Starbucks. â€œI have my own cup. I have my own cup.â€ â€œYeah, so do we. Theyâ€™re at home.â€ â€œLet me understand this. â€œYou have your life together enough to bring your own cup, but you canâ€™t make your own damn coffee?
[laughter]
No. No. You have to go.â€ Thatâ€™s why I think there needs to be a button in Starbucks, a simple button, that when itâ€™s pressed, two men dressed all in white would just appear and-and deal with the annoying person. Theyâ€™re like, â€œHey, I see you brought your own cup. Why donâ€™t you come with us.â€ The person would be like, â€œI bought the cup here.â€ â€œThatâ€™s cute. We want to show you something.â€
[laughter]
And theyâ€™d escort that person into a back room, and then youâ€™d just hear faint screams. â€œOw!â€
[â™ª scatting â€œCarol of the Bellsâ€]
You stand there, you just stand. All the chairs are taken â€™cause Starbucks is not only a coffee shop, itâ€™s also an upscale unemployment office.
[laughter]
Filled with students, people on conference calls. Thereâ€™s always that one guy that set up his office in Starbucks, â€œCan you move your fax machine?â€ Itâ€™s packed. Itâ€™s like the opposite of Dunkinâ€™ Donuts. You walk in Dunkinâ€™ Donuts, you feel like youâ€™re entering an active crime scene.
[laughter]
Shelves are bare. Thereâ€™s no employees around. â€œAre you guys even open? â€œDid I just break in? I donâ€™t want to touch anything and leave my DNA.â€ So instead, I subject myself to the Starbucks experience, and after what feels like an eternity, they finally announce my order. â€œI have a tall black coffee for Satin.â€
[laughter]
â€œItâ€“ itâ€™s Satan.â€
[laughter]
[â™ª scatting â€œCarol of the Bellsâ€]
[cheers and applause]
Thank you.
[applause]
Iâ€™m not good at waiting. Iâ€™m not good at waiting. Like lines. I donâ€™t even like seeing other people stand in lines. Once I drop my kids off at schoolâ€“ Iâ€™ve done it onceâ€“ and I was walking home, and I saw this line of 30 or 40 people at 8:00 a.m. in front of this building. There was no signage on the building, so I went up and I asked, I was like, â€œWhatâ€™s this line for?â€ And this woman goes, â€œOh, they released a new sneaker.â€ And I had to hold myself back from saying, â€œOh, you should probably kill yourself.â€ I didnâ€™t say that. I thought it. And Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s probably a sneakerhead in the audience, and I want you to hear this. You should be embarrassed.
[laughter]
I know you think you look cool in your $600 Air Jordans, but all we see is someone thatâ€™s gonna need to borrow money. But I have friends like that. They spend all their money on sneakers. And I would never encourage someone to do drugs. But occasionally Iâ€™ll ask them, Iâ€™m like, â€œHave you tried drugs?
[laughter]
Thereâ€™s never a line for drugs.â€ But we all encounter these mystery lines. One time I was driving to a show, and I started passing all these people sitting in their car, lined up, dozens and dozens of cars. When I finally got to the front, I realized it was a line for Chick-fil-A.
[laughter]
And understandably, my first thought was, â€œOh, my God, Chick-fil-A released a new sneaker.â€
[laughter]
Now, I like Chick-fil-A. I like Chick-fil-A, but this line was at least an hour, an hour-fifteen for drive-thru Chick-fil-A. And Iâ€™m no chef, but in that time, Iâ€™m pretty confident I could have deep fried a chickenâ€¦ eaten it, and had diarrhea.
[laughter]
Oh, now you like the diarrhea jokes, huh? [chuckles] You appreciate the diarrhea callback, which makes sense, â€™cause what is diarrhea but a callback to what you ate earlier?
[laughter]
â€œOh, thatâ€™s right. The burger had jalapenos.â€
[laughter]
â€œHis entire show was death and diarrhea.â€
[laughter]
It is great to be back in Tampa. Thank you for coming out. [cheers and applause] I, uhâ€¦ Iâ€™ve performed here many times. Occasionally, I will perform in a city Iâ€™ve never been. I did a show in Rochester, Minnesota. Iâ€™d never been, so I asked my cab driver, I was like, â€œIs there anything I should know about Rochester?â€ And he said, â€œOh, yeah. We got a really cool bell tower.â€ And I thought, â€œOh, wow, so thereâ€™s nothing.â€
[laughter]
But I tried to be polite. Heh. I was like, â€œOh, bell tower. Interesting.â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, I could take you there,â€ and I was like, â€œEh, itâ€™s all right. I donâ€™t want to overstimulate myself. Yeah, I-I just heard a bunch of bells in Starbucks, so Iâ€™m good.â€ Of course, there was a time when a bell tower was interesting, and not only that, there was a time when a bell, a bell was cutting-edge technology. From a historical standpoint, not that long ago. Not that long ago. Back in the day, if a person was walking to his town, someone might be like, â€œYouâ€™re going to this town? Well, get ready â€™cause, believe it or not, this town has a bell.â€ And back then, that person might have been like, â€œA bell? Whatâ€™s that?â€ And then someone would have to explain. Theyâ€™d be like, â€œWell, itâ€™s kind of hard to describe. Itâ€™s this metal thing, kind of shaped like a bell.
[laughter]
It rings, itâ€™s magic.â€ There was a time when bells were new, which means there were people that were resistant, suspicious. â€œYou know, I donâ€™t trust that bell. When they ring it, I cover my ears. I donâ€™t want the government harvesting my DNA. No, thank you.â€ They were probably people worried about the effects the bell would have on children. You know, â€œKids are already distracted. Now theyâ€™re ringing that damn bell every hour. Soon, kids wonâ€™t even be able to read a sundial. Mark my words, kids have become addicted to these bells. Weâ€™ll have to limit their bell time.â€ I like how some of you are looking me, like, â€œNow heâ€™s doing bell jokes? I didnâ€™t know it would get this edgy.â€ The amazing thing is, you know, thereâ€™s one person in this audience thatâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m offended.
[laughter]
â€œI came to hear comedy, not some anti-bell tirade. My familyâ€™s been making bells for generations. Our business barely survives the pandemic, and then this fat ass starts badmouthing bells during peak bell season, I might add. But does he care? No, he doesnâ€™t care. Heâ€™s just some balding idiot in his early 20s, yeahâ€¦ trying to distract from the fact heâ€™s offbeat, good-looking.â€ Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s not what all of you think. Thereâ€™s so many types of bells. Oh, you thought that was the end of the bell jokes. I decide for whom the bell tolls. You never thought youâ€™d miss a diarrhea joke, did you? â€œLook, Daddy, teacher says, â€˜Every time a bell rings, an angel gets diarrhea.'â€ [James Stewart voice] â€œWell, thatâ€™s right. Attaboy, Montezuma!â€
[laughter]
Yes, that was a Jimmy Stewart bell jokeâ€¦ with a double callback to diarrhea and Montezuma. Very high degree of difficulty. And by the way, I didnâ€™t even call back theâ€¦ [â™ª scatting â€œCarol of the Bellsâ€] That would have been a triple callback, which is illegal in Florida.
[laughter]
But itâ€™s all part of my upcoming one-man show, where I reimagine the movie Itâ€™s a Wonderful Life, where every character only discusses diarrhea. [James Stewart voice] â€œWell, wh-what do you want, Mary? You wantâ€“ you want diarrhea? Well, just say the word, and Iâ€™ll throw a lasso around it, and Iâ€™d pull it down, and youâ€™d swallow it, and the diarrhea would squirt out of your fingertips. But yourâ€“ your diarrhea is not here. Your diarrheaâ€™s in Joeâ€™s house, which is next to yours. Donâ€™t you understand here? Montezumaâ€™s not buying. Heâ€™s selling.â€ [Clarence voice] â€œStrange, isnâ€™t it? How one manâ€™s diarrhea touches so many other lives. And when that diarrhea is not there, it leaves quite a hole.â€ Some of you are like, â€œHow about less difficult jokes that are actually funny?â€ [chuckles] I, uhâ€¦ I do hope everyone feels well. I did a show recently, and this guy in the front row became ill. Had to stop the show. They turned on the lights. Paramedics came in. He was fine. But you should know, my comedy can cause illness. They brought the guy to the hospital. I donâ€™t know what he told the doctor. He was like, â€œYeah, I was watching Jim Gaffigan do stand-up comedy, and I just started feeling nauseous.â€ The doctorâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s not unusual. By chance, was he doing jokes about bells?â€ â€œHe had a couple of bell jokes.â€ â€œSo, too many bell jokes. Anything else?â€ â€œUh, at one point, I saw this bright white light, but I think that was just Jim.â€ â€œIâ€™m going to prescribe you some Taco Bell. I suggest you eat it on the toilet.â€
[laughter]
It always goes back to diarrhea. The guy in the front row was fine. Be weird if I was like, â€œYeah, he died.â€ He was fine. Same show. Half hour later, same show, someone in the audience went into labor during the show. I assume it was a woman. The mother was fine. The baby was fine. So, even if the guy in the front row had died, it would have been essentially a wash.
[laughter]
You know, you win some, you lose some. I mean, thatâ€™s comedy, right? Hereâ€™s something cute. Because the baby was delivered at my show, they decided to call him Fat Ass.
[laughter]
Which is not even true, but it still hurts my feelings. But what are the odds? What are the odds, two medical emergencies at the same show? And I think the weirdest coincidence, I made both stories up.
[laughter]
Right? Iâ€™m kidding. Iâ€™m kidding. The guy in the front row died.
[laughter]
He was killed by the baby.
[â™ª scatting â€œCarol of the Bellsâ€]
â€œI wasnâ€™t sure if he was trying to make us laugh or just annoy us.â€ A little rainy out there, but itâ€™s nice. Thatâ€™s the temperature itâ€™s supposed to be. Remember when weather wasnâ€™t frightening? â€˜Cause now, if itâ€™s unseasonably warm or unseasonably cold, we all give each other look like, â€œThis means weâ€™re all gonna die. Thereâ€™s a flood coming.â€ But admit it, when you left your house, you used to think, â€œEh. Do I need a coat?â€ Now youâ€™re like, â€œShould I buy a boat?â€
[laughter]
I donâ€™t know much about global warming, but I do know they stopped debating it. Five years ago, there was always a guy on TV, like, â€œThereâ€™s no proof the Earth is warming.â€ And now that same guys like, â€œWell, whatâ€™re ya gonna do?â€
[laughter]
â€œWait, what?â€ â€œThe people who live on the coastline should sell their homes.â€ â€œTo who?â€ â€œWeâ€™ll figure it out later on.â€ Somethingâ€™s happening. In 20 years, what are we going to tell our children and grandchildren? â€˜Cause theyâ€™re gonna ask us, theyâ€™re gonna come to us, theyâ€™re gonna be like, â€œDid you know about global warming? And weâ€™re gonna be like, â€œI mean, I heard about it.â€
[laughter]
I mean, it was more of a rumor back then, really. â€œDid you protest like that Greta lady?â€ â€œWell, heh, kinda. I mean, you know, there was a pandemic. We didnâ€™t really do groups. I meanâ€¦ I brought my own cup to Starbucks.â€
[laughter]
Thereâ€™s floods, thereâ€™s fires. Thereâ€™s a pandemic. In biblical times, these would have been messages from God. Like, we donâ€™t know, God might be up there right now, likeâ€¦ [God voice] â€œAre they getting any of these messages? Is anything getting through?â€ And Godâ€™s assistantâ€™s likeâ€¦ [nasally voice] â€œEh, no, sir.â€ [God voice] â€œSet the entire state of California on fire.
[laughter]
Did they get the message?â€ [nasally voice] â€œUh, one woman is saying itâ€™s space lasers, sir.â€ [God voice] â€œWhat about the pandemic? I sent a plague.â€ [nasally voice] â€œUh, theyâ€™re blaming the guy who came up with Microsoft Word.â€
[laughter]
â€œI miss the days when you could send a plague and people would listen.â€ â€˜Cause thatâ€™s how God used to communicate He was unhappy. Heâ€™d send a plague. That was like His sad-face emoji.
[laughter]
God would send a plague, and humans would interpret it. â€œLike what?â€ â€œHe either wants you to let the Hebrews go, or wow, he really wants us to eat these frogs. â€˜Cause this is a lot of frogs.â€ I love how that was one of the plagues. Like God got His assistant and goesâ€¦ [God voice] â€œWrite down all these plagues.â€ And the assistantâ€™s like, â€œAh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna freak that pharaoh out. First weâ€™re going to turn all the water into blood, water into blood.â€ And the assistantâ€™s like, â€œWater into blood. Got it, sir.â€ [God voice] â€œAll right, now weâ€™re going to take it up a notch. Frogs.â€
[laughter]
And the assistantâ€™s like, â€œUh, what about frogs, sir?â€ â€œThatâ€™s the second plague. You know how everyoneâ€™s frightened of frogs.â€ â€œUh, they are, sir?â€ â€œOh, yeah. I created frogs, and Iâ€™m terrified. I mean, what are frogs? Are they fish? Are they lizards?â€ â€œUh, theyâ€™re amphibians, sir.â€ [Godâ€™s voice, mocking] â€œTheyâ€™re amphibians, sir.
[laughter]
â€œJust write down the damn plagues. I donâ€™t pay you for your commentary.â€ I like how there were ten plagues. Ten plagues. You know, like they were albums God released. Like a catalogue. Was there ever a retrospective where God was interviewed? He was like, â€œHa ha ha, yes, my ten plagues, theyâ€¦ They they really were a reflection of where I was at the time. I knew I wanted to start with water into blood. I was going to do water into wine, but I thought Iâ€™d save that for myself. And then the frogs. Heh heh heh. I was in a crazy place.
[laughter]
I had just watched a bunch of Muppet movies.â€
[laughter]
Godâ€™s communication, all over the place, right? He did the plagues. Then he talked to Moses as a burning bush. Then he sent angelsâ€¦ He was like, â€œGabriel, get in here!â€ And Gabriel was like, â€œAh, yes, sir? I have my horn. Do you want to hear a song?â€ Godâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know. Gabriel, I need you to go down to Earth and find Mary.â€ Gabriel was like, â€œUh, do you have a last name, sir?â€ [God voice] â€œMary. Uh, Maryâ€¦ â€œItâ€™s not Magdalene. Itâ€™s the other one. Oh, youâ€™ll recognize her. She has a halo, and she stands like this.â€
[laughter]
[Gabriel voice] â€œUh. Okay, sir.â€ â€œGo down to Earth, find Mary, and tell her sheâ€™s gonna have my child.â€ [Gabriel voice, stammering] â€œE-e-excuse me, sir?â€ â€œTell Mary sheâ€™s going to be my babyâ€™s mama.â€
[laughter]
â€œSir, youâ€¦ you want me to tell her?â€ â€œWell, I canâ€™t do it. Sheâ€™s only 14. It would be inappropriate.â€
[laughter]
â€œUh, anything else, sir?â€ â€œYeah, when youâ€™re down there, get me some hummus. Look out for frogs. Theyâ€™re everywhere.â€ Iâ€™m Catholic. Catholics believe that God has sent Mary down to Earth numerous times. These are called Marian visitations. Mary usually comes down and talks to the least helpful person she can find.
[laughter]
Mary will be like, â€œYou, French peasant girl, build me a church,â€ and the girlâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m 12.â€ But my favorite Marian visitation is when Mary visited Mexico, she visited Juan Diego. Juan Diego was an Aztec convert who used to walk ten miles every day to church, ten miles. And one day, Juan Diego was walking to church, and Mary appeared, and she was like, â€œJuan Diego. Tell the bishop to build a church here,â€ and Juan Diegoâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ve been Catholic for a week.â€ And Maryâ€™s like, â€œJust do it.â€ So Juan Diego walked all the way into town, all the way into town, all the way into town. And he found the bishop, and heâ€™s like, â€œBishop, Jesusâ€™ mom told me to tell you to build a church closer to where I live.â€ And the bishop was like, â€œDo you have proof?â€ And Juan Diego was like, â€œAh, she made it sound like you guys knew each other.â€
[laughter]
And the next day, Juan Diegoâ€™s uncle, who he lived with, became ill. And heâ€™sâ€“ the uncle sent him into town for help. And as Juan Diego was leaving, he remembered Mary, and heâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t want to run into her,â€ so we went a different way, thinking he could trick Godâ€™s mom. And Mary was like, â€œWhat the hell are you doing?â€ He said, â€œAh! My uncleâ€™s sick. â€œIâ€™m going to get him help, andâ€¦ and the bishop, he said he needs proof.â€ And Mary said, â€œIâ€™ll deal with your uncle. Go into the mountains and pick these flowers and bring them to the bishop as proof,â€ and Juan Diegoâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t think you know what proof is.â€
[laughter]
But he went into the mountains, and he picked all these flowers, and he put â€™em in his cape, and he walked all the way into town, and he found the bishop. And he said, â€œBishop, Jesusâ€™ mom told me to tell you to build a church closer to where I live.â€ And the bishop was like, â€œDo you have proof?â€ And Juan Diego was like, â€œI hope you like flowers.â€
[laughter]
And he dropped his cape, and all these roses that were not in season fell to the ground. And on his cape was an image of Kanye West.
[laughter]
No, it was the Virgin Mary, you sinners. But as a result, the bishop built the church closer to where Juan Diego lived. All of Mexico became Catholic. And Juan Diegoâ€™s uncle invented the burrito. And if you donâ€™t believe that, youâ€™re going to hell.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
I mention Mexico a bunch in this show, and not just â€™cause Iâ€™m Mexican.
[laughter]
Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to go to Mexico a couple times. Last time I went to Mexico City, and when we were driving from the airport, we started passing all these billboards for hot-air balloon rides, hot-air balloon rides, and my daughters were so excited, they were like, â€œOh, my God, hot-air balloon rides! Can we do that? Can we do that?â€ And my daughters are so sweet. And as any parent will tell you, the pandemicâ€™s been especially hard on children, so I turned to them and I said, â€œNo.â€ â€˜Cause I was suspicious. I had only seen balloon rides in The Wizard of Oz or Viagra commercials.
[laughter]
But when I got to my hotel, the concierge gave me a number. So I called, they explained how much it would cost, that Iâ€™d have to sign a waiver, and that someone would pick us up at 5:00 a.m. And I was like, â€œIn the morning? Uh, can we get a later flight? I mean, we just want to go in a balloon. Weâ€™re not looking to work out with Mark Wahlberg.â€ But it was obvious, 5:00 a.m. was the only option, the only option. So, then I had to go back to my daughters, who were on spring break, and explain that there were no spots available. No. So, the next morning, we were picked up at 5:00 a.m. in a filthy van, and we drove for two hours in the dark like we were participating in a hostage exchange. I looked at my sweet daughters, Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat am I doing?â€ Whatâ€“? But I convinced myself, these people know what theyâ€™re doing. This is their business. They know what theyâ€™re doing. And when we finally got to the balloon site, I realized, oh, they donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing.
[laughter]
Now, Iâ€™ve never assembled a hot-air balloon, and from what I observed, neither had any employee. Everyone was looking at each other, going likeâ€¦ Like, if you got on a plane, and you looked in the cockpit and the pilot was likeâ€¦ youâ€™d be concerned! So Iâ€™m not embarrassed to admit this. I evaluated the situation. I thought, â€œYou know, Iâ€™m here with my teenage daughters. Iâ€™m in a country where I donâ€™t speak the language, and I donâ€™t think these people know what theyâ€™re doing.â€ So I made the executive decision that my daughters and I would die in a balloon crash.
[laughter]
Mainly â€™cause we had driven two hours. Weâ€™ve all done that. Youâ€™re like, â€œWell, weâ€™re here.â€
[laughter]
I assumed eventually thereâ€™d be a safety briefing. Thereâ€™d have to be a safety briefing. There was never a safety briefing. We just stood there watching these people put together these balloons, and at one point, a guy standing next to one of the balloons pointed to me and my daughters and then pointed to the balloon. He didnâ€™t say anything. He just pointed. So later on, if there was an investigation, he could say, â€œI didnâ€™t tell them to get in the balloon. I was pointing to the people behind â€™em.â€ And like the sheep we are, we just start walking towards the balloon. I remember thinking, â€œThis doesnâ€™t make sense,â€ but nothing about a hot-air balloon ride is logical. Itâ€™s just a dumb idea that was somehow pitched to a moron. You know, some idiot was like, â€œI think Iâ€™ve come up with a form of transportation which is slightly slower than walking.â€
[laughter]
That should have been the end of it. But there was a moron there going, â€œLetâ€™s do. What do you need? Letâ€™s do it.â€ And the guy was like, â€œWell, all I would need is, a balloon the size of a building, an enormous Easter basket, and a blowtorch.â€ And the moron was like, â€œLetâ€™s do it. Can the balloon look like we stole it from the gay pride parade?â€
[laughter]
â€œI donâ€™t see why not.â€ We eventually reached the basket of our balloon. By the way, it was a physical basket made of wicker. Wicker! You know, that stuff that can barely carry your laundry? It was supposed to cart my fat ass through the sky. Now the pointing guy was motioning for us to get in the basket. There was no ladder. My daughterâ€™s got in fine. I kind of tried to climb in this gigantic Easter basket like I was shooting a scene from Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. When I landed, I heard a crunch, and I looked up and I saw flames, and I was like, â€œAm I already dead?â€
[laughter]
In our balloon basket was our balloon pilot. That feels like a generous title. Pilot? Iâ€™m not saying we should call them rope-pullers, but if there was an emergency, â€œIs anyone a pilot here?â€ â€œIâ€™m a pilot.â€ â€œOh, Thank God. We need someone to fly the plane.â€ â€œWell, Iâ€™m a balloon pilot. But donâ€™t worry, just show me where the rope is.â€
[laughter]
Our balloon pilot was arguing with someone on a walkie-talkie, and I donâ€™t speak Spanish, but from what I pieced together, he was telling someone, â€œDonâ€™t make me do this. I donâ€™t want to die.â€ I donâ€™t speak Spanish, so I just kept listening for the word â€œproblemo.â€ Did he say problemo or poblano? Hopefully, heâ€™s ordering a spicy lunch. Then this very official-looking woman came up and spoke the only English we heard all day. She looked right at me and she said, â€œWhen you land, you bounce.â€ And then she left.
[laughter]
I wasnâ€™t sure if that was a prediction or directions, butâ€¦ I was pretty confident that was the safety briefing. Then immediately we started floating, and I was overcome by this feeling of, â€œLetâ€™s go back down. Why donâ€™t we go back down?â€ â€˜Cause not only were we floating, we were drifting. It was obvious the pilotâ€™s not steering. Heâ€™s just adding hot air so we can float. Heâ€™s likeâ€¦ [making whooshing noise] The loudest, most obnoxâ€¦ [making whooshing noise] Luckily, our pilot would only do it when I was talking. Iâ€™m like, â€œGirls, be careâ€“â€ [makes whooshing sound] During the entire trip, I was likeâ€¦ [makes whooshing sound] And I thought the only thing worse than hearingâ€¦ [whoosh] during a balloon trip would be not hearing it. I spent most of the trip looking down, wondering where weâ€™re gonna land, only seeing places I didnâ€™t want to land. A busy highway, field of cactus, pack of wild dogs. We eventually landed in an empty soccer field. We sat there for like ten minutes, and then this guy in this tiny car drove up, beeped his horn. We got in. He drove away. Then I was like, â€œI donâ€™t even know if heâ€™s with the balloon company.â€
[laughter]
There was a solid minute when I was like, [scoffs] â€œI just volunteered to be kidnapped.â€
[laughter]
I felt guilty â€™cause I had hurried my daughters. I was, â€œCome on, letâ€™sâ€“ Donâ€™t leave the kidnapper waiting!â€
[laughter] Just imagine how Iâ€™d have to explain it to my wife. Sheâ€™s like, â€œHowâ€™d he force you in the car?â€ â€œWell, we just got in the car.â€
[laughter]
â€œDidâ€“ Did he have a weapon?â€ â€œYeah. He had a horn.â€
[laughter]
But he drove us back to the balloon site. We got back in our filthy van. We drove two hours back to our hotel. It was the most expensive, inefficient trip Iâ€™ve ever taken my life. But my daughters loved it, so I would do it all again.
[rising applause]
Iâ€™m kidding. Iâ€™d never do it again.
[laughter]
I do try to travel with my kids whenever I can. I have five children, so itâ€™s not easy. But because of stand-up comedy, Iâ€™ve been able to take my kids amazing places, amazing places. And during each of these trips, thereâ€™s always a moment when I look at my kids and I have the same thought, â€œI could just leave â€™em here.â€
[laughter]
â€˜Cause itâ€™s too hard! Itâ€™s way too hard to travel with kids. Thatâ€™s why every dad on vacation looks like he lost a bet. [laughter] You ever see a Dad on vacation? Theyâ€™re so confused. Theyâ€™re always likeâ€¦ [laughter] Wait, is this my vacation? [laughter] Butâ€¦ Butâ€“ But Iâ€™m not having any fun. [laughter] Occasionally, youâ€™ll catch a dad on vacation mumbling to himself. Heâ€™s just calculating expenses. Six hundred times sevenâ€¦ Could have bought a boat.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
Thank you. Moms on vacation are usually happy, mainly â€™cause they know the dad is suffering. And thatâ€™s why some marriages work. Of course, we travel with our children â€™cause theyâ€™re our children. Thereâ€™s no other reason to travel with a child. [deep voice] â€œYou know what would make this road trip epic? A 4-year-old.
[laughter]
Me, you, Fat Tony and an un-potty-trained 4-year-old. Itâ€™s going to be insane. Letâ€™s do it!â€ [laughs] [normal voice] That was almost frightening. Sometimes when people find out I have five kids, they think Iâ€™m good at parenting, which is kind of like assuming people with lots of cats are not crazy.
[laughter]
I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing, and thereâ€™s no learning curve. Itâ€™s not like what you learn from one child you can apply to another one, â€™cause kids are annoying. Theyâ€™re like individual humans. With their own interests. I encounter this constantly. Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right, you wanna play basketball? You want to do parkour, and you want to do karate? Well, youâ€™re all doing basketball.
[laughter]
â€˜Cause this guyâ€™s only making one trip. And if you donâ€™t like it, you can blame your brother, whatever his name is.â€
[laughter]
I do try. I try to be a good dad. My wife and I, we try to be good parents. We try so hard. Not that youâ€™d be able to tell. Like if you met one of my sons, you might think, â€œOh, wow, Jim decided not to parent this one. What, did he feed him in a cage?â€ We tryâ€“ we try to get our sons to sit at a dinner table like humans. Itâ€™s not in their nature. Eventually, all parents ask themselves like, â€œAm I having any impact at all? Is it nature or nurture?â€ You knowâ€“ You know, the parents of NBA players are probably pretty confident. â€œIt was mostly us.â€ But, you know, the Dahmers were like, â€œWe had nothing to do with this.â€
[laughter]
Now, if you have young children, you might think Iâ€™m being negative, but if you have teenagers, youâ€™re like, â€œJimâ€™s being nice.â€
[laughter]
â€˜Cause itâ€™s a different experience! Like by round of applause, who only has children under the age of 5, just under the age of 5?
[light applause]
Okay. You know nothing!
[laughter]
You live in a fantasy. Youâ€™re probably not even fat or an alcoholic yet.
[laughter]
I know your life is hard, but itâ€™s gonna get so much worse.
[cheers and applause]
Enjoy this brief period when your children still like you. Parenting is hard the entire time. The task changes, though. When you have a baby, youâ€™re like, â€œThis is the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever done, but I would do anything for this baby.â€ And when you have a teenager, youâ€™re like, â€œThis is the hardest thing Iâ€™ve ever done, but I donâ€™t want to go to jail for murder.â€
[laughter]
Your experience may differ. Our real issue, the issue we face is, we have too many kids. We have too many kids, but if I did anything about it now, people would get so upset.
[laughter]
â€œHow old is the fetus?â€ â€œSeventeen years.â€ Five kids is a lot! Itâ€™s a lot. And my wife works so hard. She works so hard and I try to travel as much as I can.
[laughter]
Thereâ€™s always help. We always have a babysitter or a helper, and these people have incredible backstories. Often theyâ€™ve escaped from countries with oppressive regimes andâ€¦ theyâ€™re always sending money back to help a relative. And after theyâ€™ve worked for us for a month, they always come up and say the same thing. â€œI quit.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œDo you need more money?â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m going back to North Korea. That place is like a vacation compared to being around your family.â€ Five kids is a lot! My parents had six kids, but it was easier back then â€™cause they didnâ€™t care.
[laughter]
Six wasnâ€™t even that big. We lived across from a family that had 13 kids. Thirteen! You never even saw the mother. Occasionally, thereâ€™d be a shadow in a window. She was like Boo Radley. We werenâ€™t sure if she even existed. Eventually, I met the mother of 13, and she was a sweet woman who obviously hadnâ€™t slept in 40 years. But she looked like a mom. â€˜Cause moms used to look like moms. Now moms look like yoga teachers. Moms look like yoga teachers and dadâ€™s look like yoga teacher stalkers.
[laughter]
When a dad canâ€™t find a mom, he definitely sounds like a stalker. Heâ€™s like, â€œWhere the hell is she? Iâ€™m gonna kill that woman.â€ â€œCan I help you, sir?â€ [scoffs] â€œItâ€™s my wife. Iâ€™m gonna kill her.â€ But no matter what a parent looks like, thereâ€™s an unseen mental tax thatâ€™s been paid. You know, like they did a study. All those people that stormed the capital on January 6th, you know what they all had in common? A teenager at home.
[laughter]
â€œJim, thatâ€™s cheap. But Iâ€™ll take it.â€ Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m always tired. I know I come across as high energy. Iâ€™m always tired, and Iâ€™m married to a woman who never sleeps. I donâ€™t know if anyoneâ€™s with a non-sleeper, but if you attempt to get rest with a non-sleeper, you appear selfish. Every night my wifeâ€™s like, â€œOh, youâ€™re going to bed?â€ â€œItâ€™s 3:00 a.m.â€ â€œOh, I thought you loved me.â€ â€œI do. Is there something you need to tell me?â€ â€œIâ€™m tired!â€ Iâ€™m always tired. People think Iâ€™m hungover. Theyâ€™re like, â€œYou tie one on last night?â€ â€œNo, this is just my body trying to stay alive.â€ Iâ€™ve become one of those guys, when Iâ€™m sitting in a chair, and I go to get out of the chair, people around me are like, â€œI donâ€™t think heâ€™s gonna be able to do it. Itâ€™s 50/50.â€ I have to make a plan. â€œThrow your head forward, wish for the best.â€ It affects what I wear. I see people in lace-up boots and Iâ€™m like, â€œNever! How much free time do you have? What, do you have your own butler?â€ Eventually, my wife was like, â€œWe should find out why youâ€™re so tired,â€ and Iâ€™m like, â€œI think itâ€™s you.â€ So she had me call our doctor, whoâ€™s really our pediatrician. And sheâ€™s a great doctor. She gave me this at-home sleep study. So I slept one night with a mask on, and I dropped it off at her office, and she called a couple weeks later. And she was like, â€œJim, we should talk through these results.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œSure.â€ She goes, â€œWell, first of all, you have to understand, millions of people suffer from sleep apnea, but youâ€™re just a lazy sack.â€
[laughter]
What a relief. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with me. My bodyâ€™s just a lemon. My fantasy is that when I die after I die, theyâ€™ll discover that I had Lyme disease the entire time. Like the medical community will gather around, and be like, â€œHeâ€™s the most productive Lyme diseaser ever.â€ Everyone loves a quality Lyme disease joke. I think itâ€™s interesting how things that shouldnâ€™t be funny end up being funny. Like, my wife has a slight swallowing disorder. Doesnâ€™t sound like itâ€™ll be funny. And judging from some of your faces, â€œDonâ€™t go there, Jim.â€
[laughter]
Itâ€™s just a slight swallowing disorder, and she has it â€™cause she had a brain tumor. You guys are like, â€œRed flag number two.â€
[laughter]
Itâ€™s just a slightâ€“ just when she eats like bread or pizza, it sounds like sheâ€™s choking, but sheâ€™s not. Thatâ€™s just how she gets it down. Itâ€™s not a big deal. Itâ€™s something weâ€™ve gotten used to. I try not to draw attention to it. I mean, I am bringing it up in my show. Itâ€™s not a big deal, until we go out to eat, and then I look like the worst human on earth. â€˜Cause my wifeâ€™s likeâ€¦ [making gagging sound] And Iâ€™m like, â€œThis is good soup, huh?â€ [vocalizing eating] The waiters like, â€œIs she all right?â€ â€œIâ€™m surprised, she had a brain tumor.â€
[laughter]
[vocalizing eating] Probably looks like Iâ€™m trying to kill her. Iâ€™m like, â€œYou got and other stuff she could choke on? I just bought her some of that life insurance stuff.â€ Recently, my nine-year-old came up and asked me, he goes, â€œHey, Dad, what is white trash?â€ And I was like, â€œWell, what do you want to know?â€ And he goes, â€œWell, Mom said your familyâ€™s white trash.â€
[laughter]
â€œWell, sheâ€™s not lying.â€ But he really, he really wanted to know. Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat is white trash? What is it?â€ And I was like, â€œWell, itâ€™s a problematic term, â€œbut essentially, it means you have relatives that call cheddar cheese fancy cheese.â€
[laughter]
â€œOh, someone wants fancy cheese on their burger. â€œComing right up, Your Highness.
[laughter]
It looks like we got an imported beer drinker amongst us.â€ You ever have a moment where you feel like youâ€™re high class, like you hang around fancy people and youâ€™re like, â€œI got a couple of things in common with these people.â€ And then you hang around trashy people and youâ€™re like, â€œI got a lot in common with these people.â€
[laughter]
I didnâ€™t grow up dirt poor or anything, but when I was 9 years old, I did collect beer cans. Thatâ€™s what I did for fun when I was nine. You know, 9-year-olds today will play on an iPad for hours. I did that, but with garbage.
[laughter]
And I would find these beer cans walking home from school, which tells you how nice the town was. And I didnâ€™t bring â€™em to a recycling center. I put him on a shelf in my bedroom like trophies. And I had parents, too. I donâ€™t know what they were thinking. â€œOh, God, heâ€™s bringing strangersâ€™ empties in the house.â€ â€œHeâ€™ll be fine.â€ I forgot about that beer can collection. I was thinking, if I had it today, do you know how much itâ€™d be worth? Nothing. Because it was garbage collected by a child. I wasnâ€™t a bright kid. I remember in fifth grade, I had a teacher who left halfway through the year, and she was amazing. So I wrote her a thank-you note, and I showed my mom and my mom started laughing. â€˜Cause I didnâ€™t end the letter with â€œthank youâ€ or â€œsincerely.â€ I just put â€œGood riddance.â€
[laughter]
But I thought that was a positive thing. Like I was being Shakespearean or something. â€œGood riddance, my lady. Donâ€™t let the door hitteth your ass on the way outeth.â€ Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ve gotten any smarter. You ever hear someone use a word, and you donâ€™t know the meaning of the word, but instead of looking the word up, you just start using the word yourself? I do that all the time. â€œYeah, the traffic out there is like a cudgel.â€ My wifeâ€™s always there like, â€œIs that the meaning of cudgel?â€ â€œIt is now.â€ Of course, if we were in a group, my wife wouldnâ€™t say anything, right, â€™cause when youâ€™re in a relationship, thereâ€™s an unspoken agreement. When your significant other starts talking out their ass in public, you just go along. Everyone in a relationship has heard their partner say something in public, and they thought, â€œWell, that never happened.â€
[laughter]
But you know whatâ€™s more important than the truth? Not being in an argument. Rest in peace, truth.
[cheers and applause]
I grew up in northwest Indiana, which is part of the Rust Belt. If youâ€™re unfamiliar, Rust Belt, Rust Belt is a cute, catchy term to describe an area of economic devastation. Rust Belt. I remember the first time I brought my wife home. She looked around, and she was like, â€œMy God, what happened here?â€ And I was like, â€œThey fixed it up.
[laughter]
â€œUsed to be beer cans everywhere. I heard weâ€™re getting a bell tower.â€
[laughter]
There were some nice parts, but weâ€™ve all been to cities and towns like that, where every building looks like it was designed by Stalin. You kind of want to go up to the town leaders and go, â€œHey, before you kick all the gay people out, â€œlet them fix things up a little bit. They tend to have some creative ideas.â€ I feel like I grew up in a place unlike anywhere. Like, the first time I went fishing was in the community swimming pool. Every September, they would fill the public pool with fish, and then kids from the town would try and catch the fish before the chlorine killed the fish.
[laughter]
Iâ€™ve been telling this to people my entire adult life, expecting someone to be like, â€œYeah, we did that too.â€ Not a soul.
[laughter]
[chuckles] Itâ€™s like a prank was played on me. Just bought a new cell phone, just bought a new cell phone, which means the new version should be released very shortly. I never time it right. Whenever I buy a phone, the next week, people are like, â€œOh, yeah, they released a new version. The one you bought is now free.â€
[laughter]
And these phones are not cheap. Weâ€™ve become numb to the price of these cell phones. â€œWow, thatâ€™s how much I spent on my engagement ring. Well, then again, I donâ€™t look at that on the toilet, do I?â€ Weâ€™re such suckers! They overcharge us for the phone, and then they upsell us on all the accessories, like, â€œThat new phone you just bought, you got a case for it?â€ â€œItâ€“ It doesnâ€™t come with a case.â€ â€œIâ€™ve got one right here, five thousand dollars.
[laughter]
You got insurance?â€ â€œFor a phone?â€ â€œOh, you need insurance. God forbid something happens to your pretty new phone.â€ â€œWhat would happen?â€ â€œIâ€™d smack it out of your hands.â€ Thereâ€™s pressure to get a new phone, right? Thereâ€™s that manufactured old phone shame. Weâ€™ve all been there. You know, like, â€œI got the iPhone 7.â€ â€œWhat a loser. â€œWhereâ€™d you get that, the Smithsonian? Does the camera on that phone use film?â€ And thatâ€™s the only thing they improve on the phone is the camera, right? And then they try and convince us we need the new phone. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh, this new phoneâ€™s unbelievable. â€œItâ€™s got four lines. Thereâ€™s five million megapixels. You can shoot a feature film.â€ â€œUh, I just need to text my wife.â€
[laughter]
â€œYou should do a movie about that.â€ The cameras on our phones are so advanced, itâ€™s gotten to the point where when you see someone with a regular camera, just a camera, they look so out of place. Youâ€™re like, â€œIs thatâ€“ Is that guy part of a Civil War reenactment?â€ The value of a photo is, has changed, too. I get emails from my kidsâ€™ schools. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWould you like to order your childâ€™s school portrait?â€ Iâ€™m like, delete.
[laughter]
The last thing any parent needs is more photos of their children. School should just offer, â€œHey, weâ€™ll come over and delete half your photos.â€ Iâ€™d pay for that. â€˜Cause thatâ€™s what we use our phones for. For photos, emails, directionsâ€¦ Anything but talking. When my phone rings, Iâ€™m like, â€œWow, thatâ€™s obviously not for me.â€
[laughter]
I donâ€™t talk on my phone. Growing up, there was a commercial where people would just call and say, â€œI love you.â€ Can you imagine if that happened today? â€œI just wanted to call and say I love you.â€ â€œWhat, are you suicidal?
[laughter]
â€œDonâ€™t call me and say weird crap like that. Text me and ask if I can chat.â€ But the worst are the people that try to Facetime you out of the blue. You feel like theyâ€™re breaking in your house. [screams] â€œWhat do I do? I havenâ€™t showered yet.â€
[laughter]
All right, you guys have been a delight. Thank you so much.
[cheers and applause]
Thank you so much. I really had a great time. Thank you so much.

[cheers and applause]
[male announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Gaffigan.
[cheers and applause]
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Oh, that is so insincere. All I did was walk from over there and act like Iâ€™m not out of breath. What is that, like five feet? It is good to be here in Boston. Thank you for coming out.
[cheers and applause]
Excited to be here. I donâ€™t know if you can tell by my beard, but Iâ€™m fat. I donâ€™t know what happened. All I did was eat constantly, and then, boom. Iâ€™m fat. It seems unfair. I canâ€™t stop eating. I canâ€™t. I havenâ€™t been hungry in, like, 12 years. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, Iâ€™m so full. I guess Iâ€™ll have some cheese. I donâ€™t even like this cheese. Guess Iâ€™ll finish it. Maybe this will make me hungry.â€ Do you ever tell yourself that? Maybe this will make me hungry. Itâ€™s either that or feel my feelings. You know what, youâ€™re only eating your feelings. Yeah, but theyâ€™re delicious.
I canâ€™t stop eatâ€“ You ever look at medication that says, â€œDonâ€™t take on an empty stomachâ€? Never a concern of mine. Doesnâ€™t apply to me. Youâ€™re not supposed to go swimming tillâ€“ technically I should never go swimming. Like, if you saw me in a pool, youâ€™d be like, â€œArrest that man! And tell him not to wear a Speedo.â€ I donâ€™t need that image.
I used to be thin, when I was six. Iâ€™ve put on some weight, but luckily, this is intentional. I donâ€™t want to brag or anything, but Iâ€™m preparing for kind of a big role. Itâ€™s a cinnamon roll. I donâ€™t want to look like I canâ€™t finish it. You know what I mean? Once after a show, a woman came up to me, and she was like, â€œYouâ€™re not that fat,â€ like it was a compliment. I was like, â€œWell, thank you. Youâ€™re not that polite.â€
But I am fat. You know, some people should be fat, you know. We all have that friend whoâ€™s lost tons of weight. And when you see them, you think, â€œYou looked better fat. Youâ€™re thin, but you look exhausted. Go back to being fat. Looking at you makes me want to sit down.â€ â€œNothing tastes as good as thin.â€ I can think of a thousand things. Even unsalted French fries taste better than thin. You ever eat fries without salt on them? Youâ€™re like, â€œHuh, these could use some salt, but that would mean Iâ€™d have to get up and move.
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™ll just imagine thereâ€™s salt on them.â€ Feels like a sacrifice. Youâ€™re like, â€œWhat am I? A pioneer here? â€œSucking it up. I should be on that show Survivor. Once I had fries without salt on them, so I could probably live anywhere, really.â€
[audience laughing]
I just wish I wanted to eat something healthy. Recently, I saw an apple, and for a momentâ€“ justâ€“just a momentâ€“ I didnâ€™t recognize it. I was like, â€œWhat is that? Oh, thatâ€™s an apple! Itâ€™s so weird to not see it in a pie.â€ But fruit. No one really wants fruit. Itâ€™s too much work with fruit, right? Youâ€™ve got to wash it. Youâ€™ve got to peel off that sticker Al-Qaeda put on there. Thereâ€™s work, like an orangeâ€¦ Has peeling an orange ever really been worth it? Thereâ€™s not even chocolate in this. And some weirdos that use the gathering of fruit as an activity. â€œWhy donâ€™t we go apple picking?â€ â€œâ€˜Cause Iâ€™d rather die.â€ You have to pay to pick apples. OK, how much do I owe you to work for you for free? Donâ€™t rip me off. Iâ€™m no dummy.
Yet we still act excited when we see fruit. Weâ€™re like, â€œYay, fruit!â€
At least itâ€™s not vegetables. â€˜Cause no one wants vegetables. When youâ€™re at a party and they have a vegetable tray, arenâ€™t you surprised? Youâ€™re like, â€œWow. Thatâ€™s a waste of money. Hell, Iâ€™d rather eat a candle.â€ Oh, suddenly Iâ€™m the only one here thatâ€™s eaten a candle. OK, everybody. No one wants a vegetable tray. Everyone knows â€œcruditeâ€ is French for â€œthrow away in a couple hours.â€
[audience laughing]
I feel sorry for those vegetables on the tray. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat am I doing here? I canâ€™t compete with pigs in a blanket. Iâ€™m a cauliflower, for Godâ€™s sakes. Like that ranch dressingâ€™s gonna help?â€
Ranch dressing. Some of us have to settle down with the ranch dressing. The usage is ridiculous. â€œI love ranch dressing. I like to dip my pizza in ranch dressing.â€ Thatâ€™s fine. Youâ€™re just not allowed to vote anymore. â€˜Cause ranch dressâ€“ You know how they make ranch dressing? Buttermilk and sadness. Thatâ€™s the only ingredients. Interesting fact. Before they came up with ranch dressing, no one had eaten a raw vegetable ever. But we know we donâ€™t want vegetables.
But we havenâ€™t wanted fruit for hundreds of years. Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s so many paintings in museums of just bowls of fruit. â€˜Cause you could start painting a bowl of fruit. You could leave for a couple days, come back. No one would have touched the bowl of fruit. But if youâ€™re painting a donut, you better finish it on the first sitting. You canâ€™t even take a bathroom break. â€œHey! What happened to my donut?â€ Your friends say, [imitates full mouth] â€œI donâ€™t know. Some fat guy came in here. Anyway, I gotta get some milk and take a nap.â€
Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s no donut art. Itâ€™s sad, really. Whenâ€™s the last time you saw a painting of a donut? The police, they love donuts, right? Hey, cop. Why donâ€™t you get a donut? Cops love donuts. Which is an interesting stereotype, because you know who else loves donuts? Absolutely everyone. Of course cops love donuts, â€™cause they know the difference between right and wrong. And not liking donuts is wrong! Have you ever met someone that doesnâ€™t like a donut? You want to know why? Because theyâ€™re in jail. When youâ€™re in a donut shop and you see a police officer, donâ€™t you feel like something specialâ€™s happened? [gasps] An angel just got its wings. Itâ€™s special. [chuckling] I had a donut before I came onstage. I was with a friend last week. I was like, â€œYou want to get a donut?â€ He was like, â€œIâ€™m not hungry.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat does that have to do with it?â€ As if thereâ€™s ever been a good reason to eat a donut. Well, doctor says I need more powdered sugar in my diet. Donuts are bad for you, and according to my health nut wife, theyâ€™re â€œnot appropriate for a trail mix,â€ you know. Iâ€™m just on a different trail, right? Mine leads to the emergency room. That joke will be even funnier when I die from cardiac arrest. â€œThatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t laugh.â€ Donuts are all about taste.
In Los Angeles, thereâ€™s a place called Yum Yum Donuts. Itâ€™s like, what? Do you need the IQ of one to find that appealing? Yum Yum? Me like yum yum. Itâ€™s like, whoâ€™s the target audience, cavemen? I know two thing. Yellow fireball rise in sky and Yum Yum Donuts. Yum Yum Donuts, yum yum. Now thereâ€™s gourmet donuts that are deep-fried in gold. I had a gourmet donut. I didnâ€™t realize it was a gourmet donut. I just pointed at a donut, and the donut guy started ringing it up. He was like, â€œThatâ€™ll be $3.99.â€ I was like, â€œI only want one of them.â€ He was like, â€œThat is the price of one of them.â€ Then there was this long, awkward pause where I waited for him to lean forward and go, â€œJust kidding.â€ But he didnâ€™t. He just looked at me like, â€œGot you, tubby,â€ because he knew Iâ€™d pay because I was in a donut shop. Itâ€™s not like I was there to buy a yoga mat. Boston, this is like donut ground zero, right? Dunkies, Dunkies!
[cheers and applause]
I donâ€™t know, I always eat the local specialty because Iâ€™m a pig. I did this big tour of the southern states, and Iâ€™ll tell you something. People in the South are nicer. They are. Even when theyâ€™re rude, theyâ€™re nice in the South. Theyâ€™re like, â€œYâ€™all can go to hell.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œWell, thank you. You too.â€ People in the South are nicer, but theyâ€™re slower, right? And I donâ€™t mean intelligence-wise. They just move slower. Itâ€™s like, â€œHey, your house is on fire.â€ â€œAll right. Iâ€™ll get to that. But first, I need to drink me some sweet tea. Then Iâ€™ll deal with that pesky house of mine.â€ And I figured it out. Itâ€™s the biscuits and gravy. Everyone in the South moves like theyâ€™ve just had two helpings. Theyâ€™re like, â€œI shouldnâ€™t have had that second helping ofâ€¦â€ This is a nine-year-old Iâ€™m pretending to be. â€œOf biscuits and graâ€“â€ In the South, theyâ€™re eating biscuits and gravy for breakfast. Theyâ€™re not coming home drunk late at night, like, â€œIâ€™ll eat anything.â€ Theyâ€™re waking up, and theyâ€™re like, â€œTime for cement.â€ [chomping] Lunch, chicken and waffles. The South will never rise again â€™cause they donâ€™t have the energy.
[laughter and applause]
Because most of their dishes involve papier-mache.
[cheers and applause]
Theyâ€™re essentially eating pinatas down there. Thatâ€™s why they talk that way. Because after you eat biscuits and gravy, you canâ€™t be expected to say â€œyouâ€ and â€œall.â€ â€œGood biscuits and gravy, yâ€™all.â€ Iâ€™m surprised they even say â€œbiscuits and gravy.â€ [speaks gibberish] yâ€™all. And Iâ€™ll tell you something. Those biscuits and gravy are amazing. I had biscuits and gravy for breakfast for nine days straight. I still havenâ€™t gone to the bathroom. That tour was 27 years ago. I love Southern food. Chicken and waffles. Fried chicken and waffles. Why? What should we serve with the fried chicken? French fries? No, something elegant. Like a waffle or a gyro or heroin. I know itâ€™s lunch, but I want breakfast and diabetes, so Iâ€™ll have the chicken and waffles and a shake. Of course, you canâ€™t talk about Southern food without bringing up grits, right? Grits, itâ€™s like someone was like, â€œHey, if you love the taste of biscuits and gravy â€œbut without the taste of biscuits and gravy, then youâ€™ll love our man-made wet sand.â€ I want to like grits. I do. I order them, and Iâ€™m like, â€œAre these undercooked or overcooked?â€ No wonder you came up with moonshine. Southerners are always like, â€œYâ€™all are eating that wrong. Youâ€™ve got to add a pound of cheese and a pound of sugar and 30 candy canes.â€ Thatâ€™s what I love about the South. They donâ€™t even try and hide the fact theyâ€™re eating unhealthy. In a restaurant, youâ€™re like, â€œI guess Iâ€™ll order â€œthe bucket of lard and the salt stick.â€ â€œYâ€™all want that deep-fried?â€ â€œUh, OK.â€ â€œYou want us to shoot at you while you eat it?â€ â€œIs that extra?â€
But thereâ€™s unhealthy eating everywhere. I was in Arizona and New Mexico, and there are people eating fried bread. There are stands that sell only fried bread. And I saw that, and I was like, â€œI found my people.â€ [laughter] Fried bread. I eat unhealthy, but come on. I know a donutâ€™s fried bread, but at least we donâ€™t call it â€œfried bread.â€ I mean, at what point do you even feel comfortable eating something called â€œfried breadâ€? â€œHave you ever eaten cake in the shower?â€ â€œA couple times.â€ â€œYouâ€™re ready for fried bread.â€ â€œEver eaten in your car, so you donâ€™t have to share with your children?â€ â€œEvery day.â€ â€œYouâ€™re ready for fried bread.â€ Fried bread. That is the opposite of a diet, right? What are the basic elements of a diet? Itâ€™s like, all right, no fried food. No fried food. Got it. You gotta cut out all the bread. Cut outâ€“ hey, what about fried bread? Is there some kind of fried bread diet? Actually the term is â€œfry bread.â€ Itâ€™s not â€œfried bread.â€ Itâ€™s â€œfry bread.â€ Itâ€™s like a command, a call to action. If you arenâ€™t already, fry bread. Letâ€™s get fat. And Iâ€™m not judging those people. Theyâ€™re actually more honest than us. Because we eat fried bread, but we do it in code. Itâ€™s like, â€œYou want fried bread?â€ â€œNo. Iâ€™ll have an elephant ear.â€ â€œYou want fried bread?â€ [chuckles] â€œNo. Iâ€™ll just have a beignet.â€ Weâ€™re like that guy at the party trying to find weed. â€œHey, is your friend Bud gonna be here tonight? You know, he hangs out with that guy named Herb. Heâ€™s going out with the girl from Mexico named Marijuana.â€ I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re asking for.
Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m trying to get fat. Last night, I was eating a pint of ice cream, and I finished it because Iâ€™m American, all right? I took off the lid, and I threw it away â€™cause Iâ€™m not a quitter, everyone.
[laughter]
And because I care about the environment. I was conserving energy by not refreezing it. Youâ€™re welcome. Of course it was at night. You ever eat ice cream during the day? Youâ€™re like, what are we? Six years old? Did we just get our tonsils out? Why are there people around me? Shouldnâ€™t I be alone watching Lifetime? Those hoarders, those are the ones with the problem.
I was eating a pint of ice cream in sweatpants, like a man. My wife came in the room, and she was like, â€œJim, are you gonna eat an entire pint of ice cream by yourself?â€ And I was like, â€œHopefully. Unless you selfishly want a bite.â€ â€œJim, you have a nine-year-old daughter. Donâ€™t you want to be at her wedding?â€ â€œNot really. No. Wait, is there gonna be ice cream at her wedding? Because if you promiseâ€“ I still donâ€™t want to go.â€ How would attending a wedding, Why would that be an incentive? Itâ€™s like, â€œDonâ€™t you die! In 18 years, thereâ€™s an awkward party you have to pay for! And we need you to write a check.â€ No, I understand weddings are an important event where we spend a lot of money so that the bride can pretend to be a princess! And marry her prince and live happily ever after because magic exists.
[laughs]
And weâ€™re a bunch of weirdos. Weddings are kind of weird. I mean, whatâ€™s the logic? Itâ€™s like, â€œWell, we love each other. Why donâ€™t we pretend we have a kingdom? [laughter] Weâ€™ll invite your parentsâ€™ friends and my parentsâ€™ friends, and weâ€™ll have a banquet. And the two kingdoms shall come together as one. And we can start our married life with a total fantasy before we go on a completely unjustified vacation.â€
Itâ€™s strange, right? I mean, weddings started off as these crude, medieval ceremonies where women, daughters were exchanged as property. Yet over the course of centuries, they got worse. [laughter] Thatâ€™s why people cry at weddings. â€œI canâ€™t believe weâ€™re still wasting money on this.â€ Whenever I see someone crying at a wedding, â€œI always say, donâ€™t worry. It probably wonâ€™t work out.â€
[laughter and applause]
It is nice to be invited to a wedding, but you always look at that invitation like, â€œAh, this is gonna cost me. Oh, good. Itâ€™s out of town. Wouldnâ€™t want to use those vacation days for vacationing.â€ And you can tell how much a weddingâ€™s gonna cost you by the type of invitation you receive. Youâ€™re like, â€œ[gasps] Oh, no. This oneâ€™s made of baby skin.â€
[laughter]
And that font and the language on that. â€œThe honorable king slayer cordially invites you to the marriage of his 40-year-old daughter to her live-in boyfriend of 12 years. Bring thy wallet.â€ Because you have to get the newlyweds a gift because theyâ€™ve done nothing! So you go to the registry. The registry, which is a nice way of saying, â€œYou donâ€™t have to get us anything. But when you do, make sure itâ€™s one of these things.â€ You ever go to the registry late, and youâ€™re like, â€œAw, the only thing left is a fork for $300. I guess weâ€™ll be the fork friends. Weâ€™ll get them the fork.â€ My wife had us register for fine china because you never know when the Popeâ€™s gonna swing by and want a microwaved hot dog on a $200 plate. My parents, growing up, my parents had fine china that you couldnâ€™t even put in the dishwasher. â€œ[gasps] Donâ€™t get that wet. You need to clean it with a kitten. [laughter] It needs to be a white kitten.â€
[laughter and applause]
At most weddings, the guests receive a gift, right? Sometimes itâ€™s, like, a bag of almonds covered in candy. Thanks. I guess weâ€™re even. Since you got me a bag of nuts. â€œFeel free to take the centerpiece.â€ Sure you donâ€™t want us to bus some tables? Uh, I didnâ€™t bring a broom, but I could sweep. Itâ€™s not always, like, nuts.
Sometimes the gift is, like, a knickknack or a Happy Meal toy kind of thing. The last wedding we were at, everyone at the wedding got a wine stopper filled with sand because the theme of the wedding was waste. [laughter] I got in trouble when I asked the bride, I was like, â€œAt what point are we supposed to jab this in our throat? During the first dance?â€ Thatâ€™s horrible [chuckles] I do find it fascinating. Thereâ€™s always a drunk person at a wedding, right? And I think itâ€™s because thereâ€™s so many awkward moments. Like that receiving line as a guest? I never know what to say to those people. I always feel like Iâ€™ve just seen a friend in a play or something. â€œThat was great. You were great up there. What you said. I like this program. Well, Iâ€™m gonna lie to someone else now. You were good too. Youâ€™re the grandma. We got them the fork. Is the bar open?â€ Some of those wedding rituals, have you been to one of the weddings where the groom removes the garter belt from the bride and flings it to a crowd of perverts? [laughter] Because he cherishes hisâ€¦ what? Who came up with that one? Hey, you know how the bride throws the bouquet? How â€™bout something for the fellas? Maybe the brideâ€™s underwear? What happens to that garter belt? Oh, I have it in a very special place. Itâ€™s in a room covered with photographs of the bride. And thereâ€™s candles and fried bread everywhere.
[cheers, applause and laughter]
Iâ€™m not against marriage. Iâ€™m happily married. Iâ€™m married to a beautiful woman, the type of woman that when Iâ€™m with her and people find out sheâ€™s my wife, thereâ€™s usually an audible â€œwow.â€ Which I suppose is flattering, but it hurts my feelings. Iâ€™m not a yeti. â€œWow.â€ Someone could approach me and be like, â€œJim, weâ€™ve discovered your wife has no visual perception. [laughter] Yeah, yeah, we donâ€™t need to correct that or anything. She doesnâ€™t like glasses.â€ But I like being married. I like having someone to look out for me. And my wife wants me to live longer. We all want to live longer, but how much longer? Like, you ever see old people, really, really old people, the look on their face? They always have that look like, [screaming] I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m still here! I would have eaten so much more ice cream. Why did I ever consume kale? Can we stop with the kale propaganda?
[cheers, applause and laughter]
That stuff tastes like bug spray. I was looking at a can of bug spray. It said, â€œMade with real kale.â€ But thatâ€™s the latest health trend. Thereâ€™s a new one every six weeks. When I was a little kid, cottage cheese, cottage cheese was considered healthy. My mom and my sisters, â€œWeâ€™re being healthy by eating this tub of cheese curds.â€ Because to be thin, you eat things that look like cellulite. Remember when pita was healthy? Pitaâ€™s not bread. Itâ€™s from the Middle East. Take cheese, bad for you. Put it in pita, itâ€™s OK. Thatâ€™s why when I smoke crack, I do it on pita. [laughter] Weâ€™re still in the middle of the wrap phase. Wraps are so good for you. When you roll food, it takes the calories out. It becomes a sandwich wand. Ta-da! No calories. Itâ€™s like sushi but not enjoyable. Thereâ€™s good fats and bad fats. I like to think of myself as a good fat. I did discover that Iâ€™m gluten-free. -Anyone gluten-free here? Yeah? -[scattered cheers] I was just kidding. Youâ€™re a communist.
[laughter and applause]
Obviously, people that are gluten-free are like any other American, except for theyâ€™re allergic to wheat, the amber waves of grain. Doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t love their country. Just means they canâ€™t stomach â™ª The purple mountainsâ€™ majesty â™ª Those are the people we should be screening at airports. Are you gluten-free/a terrorist? I donâ€™t judge. I report. You decide. Thereâ€™s a new milk every six weeks. Oh you shouldnâ€™t be drinking cowâ€™s milk. Donâ€™t drink cowâ€™s milk. You should drink soy milk. They discovered soy milkâ€™s all estrogen. You should drink soy milk unless you want to have sons with testicles. Or you could drink rice milk. And they discovered rice milk is like drinking carbs. Or you could drink almond milk because almonds make milk. Unless you have a nut allergy. Then you could drink hemp milk, which is like a nut-free almond milk made from rope. [laughter] Or you can try this new milk thatâ€™s called cowâ€™s milk. Itâ€™s big in Europe. But really, this is the kale era, right? Kale is a superfood, and its special power is tasting bad. Itâ€™s inedible. All you have to do is freeze-dry it, cover it in cayenne peppers, put it in a shake, and bury it in the ground. Kale is so good for you. Itâ€™s like a really bitter spinach with hair. Kale is so good for you. They could find out kale cures cancer, and I would still be like, â€œIâ€™m just gonna do the chemo, all right? Iâ€™ve tried the kale. OK?â€
[laughter and applause]
Havenâ€™t we evolved as a species, so we no longer have to eat things like kale? You know there were cavemen, â€œOne day, son, we no longer forage through weeds. We eat porterhouse steak and no longer sound like Cookie Monster. Now we go to Yum Yum Donut.â€ Kale. I just canâ€™t stand the kale bragging. â€œI just had some kale.â€ No one asked you. People talk about kale like itâ€™s a band. Have you seen that new album by Kale? I was at a school event because I have a thousand children. And one of the moms was nice enough to make a bean soup. So I went over, and I tasted it, and I said, â€œOh, this is very good.â€ And she leaned forward, and she goes, â€œI snuck some kale in there.â€ And I wanted to throw the bowl at her. â€˜Cause she was trying to impress me with a vegetable. Oh, wow. You smarty. But you know what? I blame Whole Foods. I do. Theyâ€™re just bored at Whole Foods. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat else can we sell these idiots? Just get me a plant. Not that one. Thatâ€™s poison ivy. Wait. Can we make milk out of that? Give me the other one. What is this? Kale? It tastes bad? Theyâ€™ll think itâ€™s good for them. Charge 20 bucks for it.â€ And weâ€™re like, â€œAh.â€ But I go to Whole Foods. I do. I waste my money there. They should just have a garbage can at the entrance of Whole Foods with a picture of a wallet over it. You just goâ€¦ OK, how many items do I get? I get two? OK, um, Iâ€™ll have the grapes for 500. And, Alex, Iâ€™ll have the loaf of bread made of wood for 10. [laughter] Iâ€™ll put the rest on my Amazon wish list. What is the business idea of Whole Foods? Itâ€™s like Costco, but instead of bulk, you get nothing. You ever look at your bill when youâ€™re leaving Whole Foods? Youâ€™re like, â€œWow, Iâ€™m really not good at managing money.â€ [laughter] Because you only remember how expensive it is when you get there. Youâ€™re like, â€œThese pricesâ€¦ Iâ€™m too lazy to go to another store. You win again, Whole Foods. Tricked me again.â€ You guys are nice. I should have showered. Iâ€™m sure most of you showered. Yeah. Thereâ€™s probably one or two weirdos out there that took a bath. A bath, how much free time do you have on your hands? What, are you taking a break from ruling ancient Egypt? I donâ€™t have anything to do, and Iâ€™ll never have anything to do, so Iâ€™ll just sit in a pool of my own filth. [laughter] Ah, luxury. I should probably take a shower after this bath, huh? I have taken a bath. It always seems like itâ€™s gonna be relaxing. Youâ€™re like, â€œAh. This is so boring! No wonder people kill themselves in these things, huh?â€ Donâ€™t worry. No one here has killed themselves in a bath. My point is no one takes baths except for that weird couple in the Cialis commercial. What kind of disposable income does that couple have? â€œHoney, after our pill-induced lovemaking, what do you say we sit in the side-by-side tubs on the porch?â€ What is the message of that commercial? This pill is so good, youâ€™re gonna have to take a bath afterwards. Iâ€™d do separate baths. Hell, do it outside. Itâ€™s gonna be messy. You know what I mean, fellas? Those erectile dysfunction commercials are just there to ruin your night. Theyâ€™re like, â€œYou enjoying your show? Just a reminder, in a couple years, youâ€™re gonna need a pill to do anything. Back to your show.â€ I took a shower. Didnâ€™t happen right away. You ever have one of those days? Youâ€™re like, â€œAh, I got to take a shower.â€ Just hours pass. â€œAh, I still got to take a shower.â€ And then when you finally do, it feels like such an accomplishment. â€œHey, I took a shower. Iâ€™m a go-getter. Showerer. Well, time for bed.â€ Shampooed and conditioned my hair, as you can tell. You got to condition your hair because everyone else does. Someone told me the reason weâ€™re supposed to condition our hair is because we shampoo our hair too often. So instead of using one product less often, we just added another product. Yeah, my wife didnâ€™t like me drinking beer every night, so to make her feel better, I started drinking beer and whiskey. Maybe thatâ€™ll get her off my back. Whoâ€™s that guy? Shampoo and conditioner. Always identical bottles for no other reason but to confuse us. You ever accidentally pour out the conditioner first? Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, crap! Thatâ€™s, like, 3 bucks!â€ You ever try and put it back in? Youâ€™re likeâ€¦ [laughter] â€œDamn holeâ€™s too small.â€ I always end up holding on to it and open the shampoo bottle with the other hand. Now, Iâ€™ll just mix that together. Hope that doesnâ€™t start a fire or something. There is that product. Itâ€™s shampoo and conditioner in one. I donâ€™t trust it. I donâ€™t like my peanut butter and jelly in the same jar. Thatâ€™s for Goobers. That jokeâ€™s for goobers. There are so many goos and potions in our showers. And theyâ€™re all just soaps with different names, right? This is a soap for your hair. This is a soap for your body. This is a facial scrub, which is soap with sand in it. [laughter] My favorite shower goo or potion, though, has to be body wash and not just because it sounds creepy. Itâ€™s like, â€œHey, I got you some body wash.â€ â€œYeah, I got you a restraining order.â€ Body wash. Wash the body. Body wash. Iâ€™m gonna wash your bodyâ€¦ [whispers] while you sleep. You can only use body wash on your body. Use it on your face, you die. Itâ€™s the truth. I remember when they first introduced body wash. I was at a drugstore, and I was like, â€œThis is so stupid.â€ Body wash. Now Iâ€™m like, â€œHoney, weâ€™re all out of body wash. Can you get some more body wash? That soapâ€™s so hard to use. Get the body wash that has â€˜energyâ€™ printed on it. I need my body wash to give me energy.â€ Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s printed on our bottle of body wash. â€œEnergyâ€ in bold. Like, they didnâ€™t even bother to think of a misleading adjective that made sense. Oh, what should we put on the bottle of body wash? Fuel-efficient. [laughter] Low-calorie. Something like that. But it doesnâ€™t matter what it says on all those goos and potions, right? Theyâ€™re snake oils, because when it comes to cleanliness, we will believe anything. Weâ€™re like, â€œOh, a facial scrub made of avocados. That makes sense. And it only costs $50. Funny, I bought an avocado today for 99Â¢. [gasps] Well, this must be good shampoo. Itâ€™s from France. And theyâ€™re known for cleanliness.
[laughter and applause]
At least I think itâ€™s shampoo. Douche de what? The French are douching their hair?â€ I did that joke in Montreal, and no one laughed. It really comes down to we donâ€™t want to smell, right? You ever catch yourself smelling, and youâ€™re like, â€œOh, my God. I gottaâ€¦ smell that again.â€ Youâ€™re, like, drawn to it. Youâ€™re like, â€œThat is alluring.â€ â€œHoney, get over here. I got a treat for you.â€ But we smell because weâ€™re animals, right? Weâ€™re just self-cleaning animals. Weâ€™re like cats. Weâ€™re likeâ€¦ I know weâ€™re supposed to be like apes, but theyâ€™re picking bugs off each other and eating it. Weâ€™re like cats. We self-clean. Weâ€™re grumpy. Weâ€™re finicky eaters. I donâ€™t want to eat that. I donâ€™t feel like eating that right now. We like to think weâ€™re like dogs. I mean, I wish I was a dog. Dogs are always in a good mood. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat is that? Throw-up? Iâ€™ll eat it. I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m just happy to be here.â€ Dogs are happy to be anywhere. You ever see a homeless guy with a dog? The dogâ€™s like, â€œThis isnâ€™t that bad. I was begging for food anyway. I meanâ€¦â€ [laughter] But weâ€™re more like cats, right? But we canâ€™t even be like a cat because a cat could scratch itself on a stationary object, and weâ€™d be like, â€œThatâ€™s adorable.â€ But if I scratch myself on a mannequin at Victoriaâ€™s Secret, they call security. If Iâ€™m just like, â€œOh, I got an itch here.â€ Especially if Iâ€™m purring, if Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [purring] Lots of undies around here, huh? You canâ€™t do that in Victoriaâ€™s Secret. I have been to Victoriaâ€™s Secret. I had a reason. You know, as a man, you need a reason to be in Victoriaâ€™s Secret. You canâ€™t just be in there like, â€œIâ€™m looking around. See what you ladies are buying.â€
I was getting my wife something for Valentineâ€™s Day. You have to reach a point in a relationship where you can get a woman something from Victoriaâ€™s Secret. Itâ€™s not like a first-date thing, like, â€œThanks for meeting me for dinner. I got you a bustier. Why donâ€™t you go in the bano and throw that on?â€ [laughter] Secretly, every guy wants to go in Victoriaâ€™s Secret. We walk by in the mall. Weâ€™re like, â€œOh, one day. One day, Iâ€™ll have a reason.â€ Because, you know, weâ€™ve seen the catalog. You donâ€™t even have to search out the catalog. It just shows up in your mail. Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, whatâ€™s this? Seems like thereâ€™s some good articles in here. If I wasnâ€™t married, I could get rejected by all these women.â€ And guys, weâ€™re just dumb enough, we see that Victoriaâ€™s Secret store, and we think, â€œMaybe thatâ€™s where those models live. Theyâ€™re probably in there right now, walking around in angelsâ€™ wings. Theyâ€™re probably in there having a pillow fight right now. If I could find a practical reason to go in there, it would be amazing.â€ And then you finally go into Victoriaâ€™s Secret, and itâ€™s like a Greyhound bus station. What, are you guys in between shifts in here? Whereâ€™s all the angels? Thereâ€™s just stressed out salesladies with headsets on. â€œUnderwear, underwear, underwear.â€ [laughter] â€œWhereâ€™s the open bar?â€ But youâ€™re still a guy in a womanâ€™s underwear store. And you donâ€™t want to look like a creep. Thatâ€™s why every man at Victoriaâ€™s Secret has the same expression on his face of, â€œBoring! This is place is boring because Iâ€™m not a pervert. Thereâ€™s nothing stimulating in here because itâ€™s boring to me, especially those huge posters of supermodels mostly naked. Boring.â€ [chuckles] I didnâ€™t know what I was looking for, so I went up to a saleslady who had the warmth of a TSA screener. â€œWhat do you want?â€ â€œNothing. I didnâ€™t touch anything. Iâ€™m leaving.â€ I was trying to be discreet. I was like, â€œLook, Iâ€™m looking for something for my wife. Sheâ€™s very intelligent. Sheâ€™s creative.â€ Because you canâ€™t say, â€œIâ€™m looking for a slutty outfit.â€ â€œShe volunteers. Sheâ€™s organized. Maybe that French maidâ€™s outfit would be good.â€ Then I was thrown because the saleslady was like, â€œWhat size?â€ And I was like, â€œSize? Uh, female? Small?â€ Because you donâ€™t want to guess too big. You donâ€™t want to be like, â€œHey, youâ€™ll grow into it. I thought you was much bigger.â€ You canâ€™t ask a stranger, like, â€œHey. Excuse me there, lady. You look like you got a keister like my wifeâ€™s. What size undies you got there? Maybe you could try on this outfit I got.â€ I just wanted it over with. When I was paying, I assumed the awkwardness was over until they handed me my purchase in a bright pink Victoriaâ€™s Secret bag that I had to carry around the mall the rest of the day that might as well have just said â€œpervertâ€ on the side. [humming]
â™ª Me and my ladiesâ€™ undies â™ª
[laughter] I like ladiesâ€™ undies so much, I got a bag full of them. â™ª Heading into Burger King â™ª Yeah, Iâ€™ll have a Whopper with cheese and a small fries for the ladiesâ€™ undies. When I got home, I realized you have to find the right time to give your gift from Victoriaâ€™s Secret. You canâ€™t be like, â€œHey, when youâ€™re done changing that diaper, I got another changie-poo for you. Itâ€™s a little gift from me to you thatâ€™s really for me.â€ Because if youâ€™re buying a woman something from Victoriaâ€™s Secret, itâ€™s really a gift for you. Itâ€™s like, â€œHere, I got me this. [laughter] Thank you. Iâ€™m welcome.â€ I am never going back there again. I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s good to be here in Boston.
[cheers and applause]
Oh, I love Bostonâ€¦ This is aâ€¦ Bostonâ€™s a tough city, right? Itâ€™s like, Boston! Boston! Lob-stah! I love the Boston energy. And you guys, all of New England, you guys love your seafood, and itâ€™s just disgusting. Lob-stah! Lob-stah! I was vacationing on Cape Cod because Iâ€™m white.]
Andâ€¦
[laughter and applause]
I was at this seafood restaurant, right? And this guy came over to our table. Wasnâ€™t even our waiter. He came over to the table. He was like, â€œHey, I couldnâ€™t helpâ€¦â€ I donâ€™t know how to do the Boston accent. â€œYouâ€™re not eating lobster. Is there a reason why youâ€™re not eating lob-stah?â€ And I was like, â€œUh, I thought Iâ€™d order what I want. I wasnâ€™t really in the mood for bug meat.â€ Because thatâ€™s what shellfish are. Theyâ€™re just creepy-crawly, giant insects on the bottom of the ocean. You know fish are swimming around like, â€œWe got to get an exterminator up in this piece.â€ Theyâ€™re bugs. They have a shell like a bug. They have spindly legs and crawl around like a bug. They have antennae like a monster. [laughter] Theyâ€™re probably monsters. Like, if you went home and you saw a chicken in your house, youâ€™d be like, â€œWhat the hellâ€™s a chicken doing in my house?â€ But if you saw a lobster, youâ€™d be like, â€œWeâ€™re moving.â€ [laughter] Because thereâ€™s not a nickelâ€™s worth of difference between a lobster and a giant scorpion. Now, I understand everyone loves lobster, â€œI love lobster.â€ Hey, I like butter too, OK? How can I eat three sticks of butter? Well, I found this giant, swimming sea scorpion. Itâ€™s just a spoonful of butter helps the bug meat go down. In the most delightful way. Lobster tail. Is that the area near the butt? Mmm. Thatâ€™s what I want, a little turf and bug butt. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. How about those restaurants where you have to pick out your own lobster? Youâ€™re like, â€œI guess Iâ€™ll take that one thatâ€™s really struggling with the rubber bands. [laughter] He seems appealing. Why donâ€™t we boil him to death?â€ Why am I involved in this decision? But the Northeast? Itâ€™s all shellfish. Maryland with the crab. Isnâ€™t it kind of a red flag you need a hammer to eat a crab? Oh, youâ€™re having the crab? Let me get you some tools, so you can crack open that bug shell and get that half a bite of bug meat. Crab, itâ€™s too much work. Theyâ€™re like the pistachio of seafood. And thereâ€™s that nasty part of the crab youâ€™re not supposed to eat. I think itâ€™s called all of it! â€˜Cause theyâ€™re crabs, as in the sexually transmitted disease. That has the same name because itâ€™s the exact same thing! Theyâ€™re just the baby version of the dinner crab. You know Godâ€™s up in heaven going, â€œWhat do I gotta do to stop them from eating the crabs? I gave it a rock-hard shell. I put it on the bottom of the ocean. I named a disease after it. Jesus, youâ€™re gonna have to go back down there.â€
[laughter and applause]
I donâ€™t even know how people order crabs with a straight face. â€œYeah, my wife and Iâ€¦ You know what? Iâ€™ll get crabs, and Iâ€™ll give her some.
[laughter and applause]
Donâ€™t tell her. I want it to be a surprise.â€ Even the crab as a creature is creepy. It always looks like itâ€™s trying to avoid an awkward situation. [laughter] â€œIs thatâ€¦ Oh, I owe that guy money. Crap.â€ Clams and oysters. How did we even start eating those? â€œHey, I found a rock with a snot in it. I was thinking of eating it.â€ â€œGo ahead.â€ â€œAll right.â€ [slurps] â€œWhatâ€™s it taste like?â€ â€œPneumonia.â€ [laughter] Oysters on the half shell. As opposed to what, in a Kleenex? Even the way youâ€™re supposed to eat an oysterâ€¦ Squeeze some lemon, a little hot sauce, throw it down the back of your throat, take a shot of vodka, and try and forget you ate a snot from a rock. Thatâ€™s not how you eat something. Thatâ€™s how you overdose on sleeping pills. Pearls come from oysters. Yeah, I try not to eat things that also make jewelry. [laughter] Oysters are an aphrodisiac? Why would we ever believe that? What do you say you and I grab some snots from a rock? See what happens. Maybe weâ€™ll end up at my place. Maybe weâ€™ll end up at the emergency room. Let it happen, baby. Clam chowder. How can we sell more clams? Why donâ€™t we put it in a soup that looks like vomit? [laughter] He went too far. Letâ€™s kill him. But most seafood gives me the willies. Like anchovies. What exactly is the difference between an anchovy and a sweaty eyebrow? [laughter] Because whenever I see an anchovy, I think, â€œSomeone has attacked Tom Selleck.â€ Why would you put that in a salad? Squid, more like the swimming sea spider. â€œBut I like calamari.â€ You could deep-fry a rubber hose, it would taste good. A little cocktail sauce, this is good hose. Octopus? Really? â€œOctoâ€ meaning â€œeight,â€ â€œpusâ€ meaning â€œreally?â€ Yes. The pus partâ€™s my favorite. The suction cups remind me we need a new bathtub mat. I wish I liked seafood. I do. I live near Chinatown in New York because Iâ€™m Chinese. [laughter] And like most Chinatowns, a lot of the restaurants in Chinatown have live seafood tanks in the windows. And Iâ€™m always like, â€œUh, do you want us to come in there, or are these sea monsters protecting your establishment?â€ Because I is scared. And I love Chinese food, and I love the Chinese culture. And Iâ€™m not just saying that because weâ€™re all gonna be working for them in six months. The Chinese have an amazing culture. They do. 3,000 years ago, they were doing brain surgery in China, yet they still havenâ€™t figured out dessert. You ever go to a Chinese restaurant? Iâ€™m not talking about the fancy Chinese restaurant that has the tea ice cream that tastes like a pack of menthol cigarettes. [laughter] Iâ€™m talking about a regular Chinese restaurant where the dessert options, thereâ€™s two, right? Thereâ€™s sliced oranges. Whoa. I donâ€™t want to overwork the kitchen. Oranges? What, did a schooner just arrive from the Caribbean? Looks like our scurvyâ€™s cured, fellas. Thereâ€™s sliced oranges, or thereâ€™s the fortune cookie, which is not even a Chinese thing. Itâ€™s an American thing, and we gave it to them. And they were like, â€œWe donâ€™t want it.â€ And we were like, â€œItâ€™s now part of your ethnic identity.â€ [laughter] Donâ€™t you feel like the fortune in every fortune cookie should be, â€œYou are about to eat a stale cookieâ€? Hey, my fortune came true! Everyone has the same reaction to fortune cookies. Theyâ€™re always like, â€œThese things are so stuâ€“ What does mine say?â€ Like thereâ€™s some ancient wisdom in there. As if Confucius himself was putting a tiny piece of paper into a tiny typewriter. â€œHappiness is aâ€¦ long journey.â€ 15. 31. [laughter] 12. Put this in a stale cookie for me, would you? Itâ€™s like they wait for them to be stale. How old are these, 1990? Letâ€™s wait a little longer. I do feel sorry for the person who created the cookie that ended up being the fortune cookie because they were probably pretty proud. They were like, â€œHey, you gonna try my new cookie? â€œTell me what you think of it. Try my new cookie. Tell me what you think.â€ â€œAll right. Iâ€™ll try it. Here you go. â€œMmm, oh. You know what this could use is some paper. Oh, this would be good for holding a note or a recipe for a good cookie.â€ [laughter] â€œHow much do you think I could charge for it?â€ Iâ€™d give it away with the check. You got a spit bucket around here?â€ [laughter] But I love Asian food. I love Kobe beef. I know I look like a vegetarian, but Iâ€™m not. Kobe beef, if youâ€™re not familiar with that, that comes from cows that are fed beer and massaged with sake. I heard that, and I was like, â€œI want to be Kobe beef. Where do I sign up forâ€“â€ Those are some happy cows. They have no idea theyâ€™re on death row. Theyâ€™re like, â€œThis is the life! [cackles] A little lower. A little lower, honey. What the hell, this cowâ€™s going for another beer. You Japanese love design. That sake bottle actually looks like a hatchet. Ow!â€ Itâ€™s just a drunk cow, and itâ€™s appealing. Which means itâ€™s only a matter of time, â€œ[gasps] You have to try this chicken. It was raised solely on Doritos.â€ â€œWhat kind?â€ â€œCool Ranch.â€ But really Kobe beef shows you how decadent weâ€™ve become, right? Now itâ€™s not enough that we live a life of luxury. Now we need to eat things that have lived a life of luxury. â€œI understand this cow had a good life, but did it go to private school? I only eat cows that went to private school.â€ â€œIt did.â€ â€œDo you have anything on your menu that owned a boat?â€ [laughter] Kobe beef, itâ€™s an interesting idea, right? It must have been a surprise for someone along the way. Itâ€™s like, â€œYou like that steak?â€ â€œThis is the best steak Iâ€™ve ever had in my life.â€ â€œYou know, I fed that cow some beers.â€ â€œYou got the cow drunk?â€ â€œYeah, and then I was massaging it.â€ â€œWhat? [laughter] Why? Why were you massaging an animal you gave a lot of alcohol to?â€ â€œSo you could enjoy it.â€ â€œSo I could enjoy it? â€œIâ€™m not hungry anymore. Iâ€™m gonna go call Special Victims Unit. Letâ€™s see what Olivia Benson thinks of this.â€
[cheers, laughter and applause]
But really we donâ€™t want to think about what weâ€™re eating. You know, I love hot dogs. You canâ€™t eat a hot dog in public. Thereâ€™s always one friend thatâ€™s like, â€œDo you know what those are made of?â€ I donâ€™t want to know because hot dogs are like strippers. No one wants to know the backstory.
[laughter and applause]
â€œWell, when I was 12â€“â€ Not interested. Letâ€™s put mustard on that. I can say that joke because I used to be a stripper. I was so good, they paid me to put my clothes back on. It was ridiculous. We donâ€™t like to think about what weâ€™re eating. Buffalo wings, chicken wings, Iâ€™m sure you savages eat those. Those are baby chickensâ€™ wings that youâ€™re eating. I donâ€™t eat those. I eat the chicken legs. I would never take away a birdâ€™s ability to fly. Some people are like, â€œOh, chickens canâ€™t fly.â€ How do we know? Theyâ€™ve become too dependent on those legs. Legs are making birds lazy. You ever see footage of a hippo crossing a river? Thereâ€™s always a bird sitting on its back. How lazy is that bird? Itâ€™s gonna take the hippo ten minutes to get across that river. That bird could glide across. That bird, I want to eat their legs. Mostly because Iâ€™m pro-hippo. [laughter] I see some of you are drinking. Thatâ€™s not the answer. Itâ€™s not. Eating is. Itâ€™s amazing how our attitude on alcohol changes, right? Because even as a teenager, you know itâ€™s wrong. Youâ€™re like, â€œYou know, I donâ€™t like the taste of it, but I want to look cool.â€ And then in your 20s, youâ€™re like, â€œYou know what? This kind of gives me confidence to talk to the opposite sex.â€ And then in your 40s, youâ€™re like, â€œYou know what? This is the only thing I like about being alive.â€
[cheers, laughter and applause]
Itâ€™s only funny because itâ€™s true. Iâ€™m sure some of you are gonna go to some bars, head to a bar, right?
[scattered cheers]
Yeah. I never really feel comfortable right when I get in a bar. Iâ€™m always kind of like, â€œWho are all these strangers?â€ But after a couple beers, Iâ€™m like, â€œThese guys are probably my best friends.â€ Because your experience in a bar changes over the course of the night, right? As the night goes on, you see really why we go to bars. We go to bars, so we can behave like children. Toddlers, really. You ever go to a bar at 2:00 a.m.? You might as well be picking up a kid at nursery school. Itâ€™s the same experience. The behaviorâ€™s the same in both places. Both places, thereâ€™s always some strange yelling for no reason at all. You know, â€œWhoo, whoo, whoo!â€ Both places, you go in the bathroom, itâ€™s obvious not everyoneâ€™s potty-trained. [laughter] Both places, thereâ€™s always someone crying, â€œShe was my best friend. But not anymore.â€ Both places, occasionally thereâ€™s a fight. â€œYou know, he was standing where I wanted to stand, so I punched him in the head. I need more juice.â€ But at 2:00 a.m., people are drunk in bars. I love how weâ€™re always surprised when someoneâ€™s drunk in a bar. Weâ€™re actually shocked. Weâ€™re like, â€œLook at that guy. Heâ€™s wasted. In a bar. I came here to read a novel.â€ Mostly the people that are drunk in bars are drunk because theyâ€™re drinking shots. And really the only time to ever drink a shot is never. No oneâ€™s ever drank a shot and then done something theyâ€™re proud of. â€œI got wasted last night, and then I went out and built some low-income housing.â€
[laughter and applause]
That never happens. You always wake up the next day, and youâ€™re like, â€œI need a new identity. Maybe two of them.â€ Because if youâ€™re drinking shots, itâ€™s either your birthday, or youâ€™re trying to forget you were ever born. There is something honest about a shot. Itâ€™s like, â€œI want to get right to the embarrassing part of the night, right to pants off.â€ But we donâ€™t even drink shots. We take them like theyâ€™re medicine. Thisâ€™ll cure my normal behavior. Everyone acts like weâ€™re in a Western. [hums Western music] Thatâ€™ll give me the courage to confront this plate of nachos. [hums Western music] Strangers will buy you a shot on your birthday. â€œHey, I donâ€™t know you. Let me buy you a shot.â€ This never happens with anything else. Hey, what do you say? You and me, letâ€™s do some appetizers. Jalapeno poppers, mano a mano. You got to turn that shot down before they get it poured, because once itâ€™s poured, they act like youâ€™re rejecting a sweater they crocheted you. â€œYou know how hard I worked on this?â€ You didnâ€™t at all. But I donâ€™t mind the bars, unless theyâ€™re really crowded, you know, like, five or six people deep at the bar. Everyoneâ€™s competing for the bartenderâ€™s attention. We look like weâ€™re trying to get disaster relief from the Red Cross. Weâ€™re likeâ€¦ [laughter] â€œI need mine more than he needs his.â€ I can never get the bartenderâ€™s attention. Iâ€™m always likeâ€¦ We try and make eye contact. Show him you have money. I have cash. But you canâ€™t try too hard in a crowded bar. You have to act all cool. You gotta be like, â€œI donâ€™t even care if I get served. I just like standing in crowded, uncomfortable places. Later on, Iâ€™m gonna swing by the airport and see what that TSA lineâ€™s like. I like the lines.â€ Never enough bartenders in a crowded bar. Those bartenders look like theyâ€™re in the middle of a triage unit. Theyâ€™re like, â€œGet me 40ccs of something.â€ Never enough bartenders. You ever get faked out by the arrival of a barback? Youâ€™re like, â€œFinally, another barâ€“ itâ€™s a barback.â€ And those poor barbacks, they always act like theyâ€™re not qualified to serve you. Like, [gasps] â€œOh, no, no, no, no. â€œI can carry 12 cases up a narrow staircase, but handing you a beer? Not yet.
[laughter and applause]
Iâ€™m still learning from the master.â€ Because in a crowded bar, the bartender is the master, right? All the authority goes to that. Some of them act like theyâ€™re not even obligated to serve you. Theyâ€™re like, â€œI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m gonna do with all this booze. Maybe Iâ€™ll just pour it out and make a puddle.â€ And we fall for it. Weâ€™re like, â€œWell, itâ€™s either deal with this guy or make it in our bathtub at home. Damn Prohibition.â€ Thereâ€™s male and female bartenders. Female bartenders, they always seem a little tougher than they need to be, right? I donâ€™t want to say â€œbitchyâ€ because that would describe them perfectly. [laughter] Not all of them. Some female bartenders definitely give off that vibe like, â€œDonâ€™t hit on me. Treat me with respect. And donâ€™t be distracted by the fact Iâ€™m wearing a bikini. OK, honey?â€ They always call you â€œhoney,â€ like theyâ€™re your grandma or something. â€œWhat can I get you, honey?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know. A birthday card with $2 in it?
[laughter and applause]
Uh, maybe a beer, if youâ€™re not too busy condescending me.â€ But if youâ€™ve been to a bar, youâ€™ve probably been to a filthy public restroom. Weâ€™ve all been in those bars where youâ€™re like, â€œOh, wow. Now I know why they serve alcohol here.â€ And when Iâ€™m talking about the filthy bathroom, Iâ€™m talking about the menâ€™s room. I donâ€™t know about the ladiesâ€™ room. I havenâ€™t been in there in, like, a week. But the menâ€™s room, I donâ€™t know what happens to guys when we go into a public restroom. Some anger comes out. Some of the stuff thatâ€™s written on the walls? You never have a friend admit it. Like, â€œHey, give me a second. Iâ€™ve got to pee and draw a swastika. Iâ€™ll be right back.â€ [laughter] Thereâ€™s guys writing things on the walls, and then there are the guys that reply. Some guy will write, â€œThis place sucks.â€ Another guy will write, â€œNo, you suck.â€ As if that first guy is ever gonna see that. Like heâ€™s gathering up his friendsâ€“ â€œWell, this is what I wrote on thisâ€“ Hey, wait a minute! That guy said I suck. You double suck.â€ But all public restrooms, even when you goâ€“ even at fancy places. You ever go in the restroom, and thereâ€™s a bathroom attendant? Arenâ€™t you always like, â€œOh, noâ€? Call me a loner, but if thereâ€™s one thing I donâ€™t want anyone attending, itâ€™s when Iâ€™m using the restroom. Let alone someone sticking around to sell me a paper towel. They donâ€™t sell. They always wave it at you, like, â€œHere. You donâ€™t have to tip me You can just have bad luck the rest of your life.â€ [chuckles] And you have to tip the bathroom attendant. You canâ€™t justify not tipping. You canâ€™t be like, â€œAh, he doesnâ€™t need it. Heâ€™s just working next to a toilet.â€ [laughter] You have to tip the bathroom attendant. Sometimes the bathroom attendant will have an incentive for a tip. Theyâ€™ll have, like, gum and cologne on a shelf. No thanks on the gum. Iâ€™m sure a lot of that flavorâ€™s probably been knocked away here in your office. â€œWhereâ€™d you get the gum?â€ â€œBathroom. Yeah, some stranger in half a tux sold it to me.â€ â€œWhat flavor is it?â€ â€œBathroom.â€ And the cologne, You know, talk about a place you donâ€™t want to pick up a scent. â€œOoh, you smell different.â€ â€œBathroom again. Same guy had a jug of liquid sitting on a shelf. I just sprayed myself. Good guy. Iâ€™m moving in with him.â€ [laughter] The most memorable public restroom I was in was a New York City park menâ€™s room, which doubles as a crime scene, the difference being that crime scenes are eventually cleaned up. Weâ€™ve all been in those scary bathrooms. Youâ€™re like, â€œWhat happened in here?â€ The lights are on, but itâ€™s really dark. Thereâ€™s water everywhere. For some reason, thereâ€™s a film crew from Ghost Hunters. But I had to go in there. I was with my three-year-old. And, you know, three-year-olds, they donâ€™t tell you when they need to use the bathroom. They tell you when theyâ€™re about to use the bathroom. â€œYou have to go potty?â€ â€œAlmost done.â€ [laughter] My three-year-oldâ€™s now four. I also have a nine-year-old and an eight-year-old and a two-year-old and a one-year-old. I have five kids. I used to have more, but I ate them. Five kids. I love it, but I donâ€™t know what happened. Ten years ago, I couldnâ€™t get a date, and now my apartmentâ€™s literally crawling with babies. Itâ€™s like I left peanut butter out or something. Strangers, for some reason, think Iâ€™m unaware that itâ€™s a lot of kids. â€œFive kids. Thatâ€™s a lot of kids.â€ â€œOh, you think so? Thanks for the heads-up. Do you mind if I stab you in the head?â€ The best is when Iâ€™m alone with my five kids and inevitably struggling, and some stranger will come up to me and go, â€œLooks like you got your hands full.â€ [laughter] Why would you say that? Itâ€™s like going up to someone in a wheelchair, â€œLooks like you donâ€™t do a lot of dancing.â€ [laughter] â€œLooks like you got your hands full.â€ Yeah. I could still punch you. But it is a lot of kids, you know. Weâ€™ve jumped the shark. Because when you have four kids, people are like, â€œWow,â€ but when you have five, people are like,â€Just stop. What, are you creating your own nationality? Settle down. Is there gonna be a country called â€˜Gaffganistanâ€™? Make a plan.â€ Big family. Big families are like water bed stores. They used to be everywhere, and now theyâ€™re just weird. Some people think itâ€™s religious. Like, â€œYou have all those kids for religious reasons.â€ Thatâ€™s not how it works. If anything, you have four or five kids, and then you become religious. Because once you lose a kid at the mall, you know, atheist or not, you start talking to God right away. Youâ€™re like, â€œHey, God. I know I havenâ€™t talked to you in a while, probably since finals in high school. Anyway, if you could help me find my son, I promise Iâ€™ll change my life. Iâ€™ll stop going to Wendyâ€™s. Oh, there he is. Never mind, God. [laughter] Well, weâ€™re off to Wendyâ€™s.â€
â™ª Doo doo doo doo doo doo â™ª
â€œTalk to you when I get cancer.â€

Because thatâ€™s how it works, right? We really only reach out when we have a crisis. Thatâ€™s got to be annoying for God. Heâ€™s gotta be like, â€œWell, well, well. Someone gets the big â€˜C,â€™ and they turn into Billy Graham all of a sudden. I seem to remember when you were in college, I â€˜didnâ€™t exist.â€™ But now youâ€™re Chatty Cathy.â€ A joke that combines cancer and religion, always a crowd pleaser. Those are two topics we donâ€™t like to discuss. We donâ€™t even like the word â€œcancer.â€ We always whisper it, like, [whispers] â€œCancer,â€ as if the devilâ€™s listening. â€œI heard you say it, and now youâ€™ve got it.â€ â€œI was whispering.â€ â€œYouâ€™ve got it twice for trying to hide it from the devil.â€ â€œWhen did the devil start passing out cancer?â€ â€œYouâ€™ve got it three times for doubting the devil â€œcan pass out cancer. â€œYouâ€™ve got it four times for bringing up the devil too many times in one joke.â€ [laughter] I used to be afraid of cancer. Now I get a headache, and Iâ€™m like, â€œGood. â€œItâ€™s almost over. Letâ€™s wrap it up. Looks like Iâ€™m not paying for that wedding after all.â€ [laughs] Thatâ€™s horrible. Itâ€™s in my future. Look at me. Iâ€™m like skin cancer waiting to happen. Cancer probably doesnâ€™t even see me as a challenge. â€œI could do that in a half an hour. Send in an intern.â€ But weâ€™re sensitive because weâ€™ve all lost someone. Iâ€™m surprised we even ask what grandparents die of at this point. â€œMy grandpa died.â€ â€œWhat kind of cancer?â€ â€œHe was hit by a bus.â€ â€œThatâ€™s called bus cancer.â€ But we say weâ€™re afraid of cancer. We donâ€™t really behave like we are. We know what causes it. Smoking causes cancer. Yeah, I only smoke when Iâ€™m drinking. Which is constant, really. We know the products that cause cancer. Every six months, thereâ€™s a new sugar replacement. â€œHereâ€™s a new sugar replacement. No calories.â€ A week later, it causes cancer. They donâ€™t even take it off the shelves. â€œHey, thereâ€™s the one that causes cancer, and itâ€™s on sale.â€ So then weâ€™re faced with a sugar predicament. Do I use the stuff thatâ€™ll kill me or the stuff thatâ€™ll make me fat? Ah, whatâ€™s a little cancer? If he does another cancer joke, Iâ€™m gonna kill him before he can ever get it. My zodiac sign is Cancer. What a rip-off.
[laughter and applause]
I remember when I was eight and I was finding out my sign. My brother was like, â€œWhat am I? What am I?â€ And my sister was like, â€œYouâ€™re a Capricorn.â€ And I was like, â€œOh, and me? What am I? What am I?â€ â€œCancer.â€ â€œOh, no! I killed Grandma. Whatâ€™s my symbol?â€ â€œCrabs.â€ â€œOh, no.â€ It all gets sewn together so pretty. It is a pretty thing sewn together.
[laughter and applause]
But I like being a dad. I do. We have a one-year-old at home, who for the first year of his life, has slept a total of one minute. But itâ€™s worth it, you know. Thereâ€™s screaming, thereâ€™s smells, you donâ€™t sleep. I was out of town, and I drove by a skunk, and all I could think was, â€œI miss my baby.â€ [laughter] Because babies are magic. They are. Because theyâ€™re the worst roommates. Like, if you had a roommate that did one of the things a newborn does, youâ€™d be like, â€œYouâ€™re moving out. I meanâ€“â€ You canâ€™t even reason with a baby. You canâ€™t be like, â€œWhat the hell was going on last night? You were hitting the bottle pretty hard. Then you started screaming, and you threw up on me. Then you passed out and wet yourself. I went in the other room to get you some dry clothes. I come back, youâ€™re all over my wifeâ€™s breasts. Dude, you got to move out. I meanâ€¦â€ Itâ€™s always fun when the mother breast-feeds. The baby always looks right at the dad like, â€œWhat are you gonna do about it? Man of the house, my ass. Why donâ€™t you take a walk? Leave your credit card.â€ Every year, when my wife has her annual baby, [laughter] it feels that way. By the way, the gifts stop after the second kid. With the fifth kid, people barely respond to the email announcement. â€œAh, weâ€™ll get them next baby.â€ Once I had a friend come up to me and go, â€œHey, congratulations on the new baby. I know how you feel. We just got a puppy.â€ I said, â€œWhat?â€ And I love dogs, so I understand it. But, like, babies are the only types of humans that can be compared to an animal and itâ€™s OK. Like, you could never be like, â€œHeard youâ€™re getting married. I know how you feel. I used to have a pig. [laughter] Bit of advice on a hot day, Hose that bride down. Sheâ€™ll love it because they canâ€™t breathe, their skin canâ€™t.â€ Twice a year, I travel. I tour with my kids. We get on a tour bus, and we go to, like, some destination. Last spring break, we went to Mount Rushmore. [man from audience] Whoo! Thatâ€™s the most applause Mount Rushmoreâ€™s ever gotten. I feel sorry for Mount Rushmore. You know, people used to go there on their honeymoon. And now, I bring up Mount Rushmore, and people look at me like Iâ€™m talking about a TV show that was canceled ten years ago. â€œIs that still going on?â€ Yeah, itâ€™s a mountain! Itâ€™s still going on. And you know what? Itâ€™s beautiful. And the Black Hills of South Dakota areâ€¦ You know, theyâ€™re sacred to the Lakota Indians. And out of respect, our government carved four white guys into one of the mountains.
[laughter and applause]
â€œThis land is sacred.â€ â€œHow about that mountain?â€ â€œVery sacred.â€ â€œGood. We got an idea.â€ Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Another gift for you guys. Ding, ding, ding, ding. These guys were all about freedom. Ding, ding, ding. Especially the two guys that owned slaves. [laughter] But thereâ€™s so much stimulation in our lives. We donâ€™t know what to make of four faces on a mountain. You know, my kids didnâ€™t know what to think. They were like, â€œIs one of the eyes gonna blink?â€ And I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know. Take a look because Iâ€™m never coming back here.â€
That is all for me. Thank you so much, you guys. I appreciate it. Thank you.
[cheers and applause]
â™ª Atten-hut! â™ª â™ª Atten-hut! â™ª â™ª Atten-hut! â™ª â™ª Atten-hut! â™ª â™ª Atten-hut! â™ª â™ª Atten-hut! â™ª â™ª Atten-hut! â™ª

[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
This is getting off the rails here. Whatâ€™s that now?
â€“ [MAN] Italian.
[MARK] Italians?
What are you doing here? You should be hitting your wife.
All right. Whatâ€™s that over there?
[MAN SHOUTS] Epstein!
Epstein. Iâ€™ve been to the island.
Umâ€¦ â€“ [LAUGHTER]
I was 14. I got to meet Bill Gates.
Ah.
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
You know, Ghislaine, she got 20 years. R. Kelly got 30, you know.
Sheâ€™s gotta be thinking, â€œThank God I didnâ€™t pee on those kids.â€
[MAN] How big is your cock?
How bigâ€™s my cock?
I donâ€™t know, ask your mom.
But, uhâ€¦ [LAUGHS]
[CHEERING]
[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
Hello?
[MAN] Hey, Mark, itâ€™s Seinfeld.
Iâ€™m just kidding. Where the hell are you? Youâ€™re late.
Iâ€™m coming right now.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[CROWD CHEERING]
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
[WHISTLING, APPLAUSE]
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and gentlemen,
Kevin Hart!
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]
[WHISTLING, CHEERING]
[MARK] All right. Here we go.
We got it. All right. Yeah.
Come on.
[WHOOPING]
Here we go. Comedy, huh?
Yeah.
[CHEERING]
Hey, weâ€™re really doing it, folks.
Good to be here. Thanks for coming out.
You guys can put â€™em back in this town, you know.
[WHOOPING]
Yeah.
I drink too much too. I gotta cut back.
You know, they say two and a half million people die every year from alcohol? Which is sad, but think about how many people it produces.
[LAUGHTER]
Gotta be like three-to-one, you know?
If my parents didnâ€™t drink, I might not be here.
Iâ€™m definitely gonna name my kids after the substance that got them conceived.
â€œThis is my daughter, Tequila. This is my son, JÃ¤ger.â€
â€œWhat about that kid hugging your leg?â€
â€œHa! Thatâ€™s Molly.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Man, I was hungover last week. Couldnâ€™t get out of bed.
You ever been so hungover, you see what youâ€™re gonna be like as an old person?
When youâ€™re real hungover, you turn into a senior citizen.
You wake up, you donâ€™t know how you got there.
Your body hurts, youâ€™re weak, youâ€™re shaking, youâ€™re popping pills.
Someoneâ€™s like, â€œWhere are your friends?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œI lost â€™em all.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Your buddies talk about you like youâ€™re old.
â€œWe took him out last night. He shit himself.â€
â€œHe made a scene, he fell.â€
â€œHe blamed everything on China.â€ [LAUGHS]
When I was in college, I got a DUI. I had to volunteer at an old folksâ€™ home.
They were 98, I was hungover. We were exactly the same.
Both shuffling down the hallway in our pajamas.
Some old ladyâ€™s like, â€œWhenâ€™s the pain gonna end?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI know, right?â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œThey took away my license.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œSame here.â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œI got an STD in this place.â€ I was like, â€œYeah. My bad.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Thatâ€™s drinking for you. Itâ€™s fun, but itâ€™ll get you into trouble.
My friend got drunk one night, blacked out, hooked up with somebody, got herpes.
Yeah. So he quit drinking.
[QUIETLY] Kept the herpes, butâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
But booze was our whole relationship.
Now every time we hang out he wants to do activities.
Horseback riding, canoeing, cycling.
Iâ€™m like, â€œJust â€™cause you have herpes
doesnâ€™t mean we have to live out the commercial.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Heâ€™s like, â€œYou donâ€™t get it. I got side effects.â€
â€œI got suicidal thoughts, insomnia, depression.â€
I was like, â€œShit, maybe I have herpes.â€
[CHUCKLES]
When I was younger, everybody smoked cigarettes when they drank. Thatâ€™s over.
Anybody still rippinâ€™ butts?
[WHOOPING]
Hey, all right, we got a couple. You guys are rare now.
When I was a kid, everybody smoked. My mom, my grandmother.
Now smokingâ€™s kinda shameful.
Weed used to be a drug, used to put you in jail.
Now weed got its medical degree and turned its life around.
[LAUGHTER]
Those two completely traded places.
You wanna smoke a cigarette now, you gotta go behind a dumpster.
People are like, â€œWhat are you doing?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œUh, paying a hooker.â€
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]
â€œIâ€™m not smoking, Iâ€™ll tell you that right now.â€
On the flip side, you can pop an edible at noon.
[SPACED] â€œHey, I have anxiety. Whoa.â€
Those two flipped.
If my mom had caught me smoking weed, sheâ€™d have sent me to boarding school.
Now your mom finds your weed, sheâ€™s like, â€œSativa? What a pussy.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Weedâ€™s everywhere now. Itâ€™s borderline healthy.
How do you punish a kid for smoking weed these days?
I got caught smoking cigarettes. My dad made me smoke the whole pack.
It was hell. What do you do with a kid with weed now?
â€œWe found a roach in your room. You gotta smoke this whole eighth.â€
Heâ€™d be like, â€œWell, put on The Office, â€™causeâ€¦â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œâ€¦weâ€™re going in.â€
I was high the other day, walking round New York.
I saw a blind guy being walked into traffic by his seeing-eye dog.
I stepped in. â€œWhoa, buddy, can I give you a hand?â€
He goes, â€œI donâ€™t need your charity, you piece of shit.â€
I was like, â€œHey, blind guy.â€
â€œIâ€™m over here.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Also, can you afford to be a prick? Youâ€™re pretty vulnerable.
I could just nut-check you. Youâ€™d never see it coming.
I was fascinated with this mean blind guy. Iâ€™m watching him with his seeing-eye dog.
I thought, you know what? Who picks up his shit?
[LAUGHTER]
The blind guyâ€™s not doing it.
This might be the best life hack of all time. Iâ€™m gonna steal that.
Next time I walk my dog, Iâ€™m not bringing plastic bags.
Iâ€™m bringing some sunglasses and a wiggly stick, right?
My dog takes a crap, some guyâ€™s like, â€œâ€˜Scuse me, sir.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ve never seen a sunset.â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œMust be nice.â€
Itâ€™s too expensive where I live. Everybodyâ€™s got nine roommates.
I used to live with a gay guy. Any gay guys here?
[QUIET WHOOP]
Hey, all right.
Good to have you.
Thanks for coming out.
[LAUGHTER]
Um, yeah.
[APPLAUSE]
Uh-huh.
[CHEERING]
Yeah.
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
Yeah. My gay roommate was great. He was always on the prowl.
Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s gotta be nice about being gay.
You like dick, and you have one. Hmm.
Thatâ€™s pretty good.
I like vagina. You know how much work it was to get vagina?
You gotta go out and tell a story and lie.
[LAUGHTER]
But a gay guyâ€™s like, â€œMan, I want some dick tonight.â€
â€œAh, I struck out.â€
â€œWhat do we have here?â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œHey, things are looking up!â€
Thatâ€™s why I never understood homophobic guys.
You know, â€œHow could a man ever suck a dick?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ve tried, itâ€™s just not long enough.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Iâ€™ve done a ton of gay shit to me, right?
Every guy in here is super gay for their dick, right? Sir, youâ€™ve given a million hand jobs to one dick, you know? â€˜Cause dicks are like kids. You like your own, but the other ones are weird.
[LAUGHTER]
Men even treat their dicks like kids.
We wash it, we take care of it, we name it.
We go, â€œYou wanna see a photo?â€ People go, â€œNo, thank you.â€
The only difference is, you beat your kid at the mall, nobody stops you. [CHUCKLES]
[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]
I grew up in Louisiana. A lot of homophobia.
I grew up with a guy who hated gay people.
He was obsessed with gay guys taking the rainbow.
That was his big beef.
â€œGay guys took the rainbow.â€
That might be the gayest complaint Iâ€™ve ever heard in my entire life.
Took the rainbow? They just made it their flag.
And we all know, God hates flags.
Butâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
A better argument would be mentally challenged people taking the word â€œspecial.â€
Thatâ€™s a better argument. That wordâ€™s changed a lot over the years.
Special ed, special needs, Special Olympics. Itâ€™s confusing now.
I go to a restaurant, â€œWanna hear the specials?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuck you guys cooking?â€
â€œWhat the hellâ€™s going on in that kitchen, huh?â€
Whatever it is, Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s slow-cooked.
But either way, I donâ€™t know.
[CHEERING]
[APPLAUSE]
Mm, mm, mm.
[WHOOPING]
But, you knowâ€¦ These are weird times weâ€™re living in. Weâ€™re hung up on sexual orientation these days.
Like transgender, what do you think?
Itâ€™s a tough one. Yeah.
Itâ€™s a hot button issue. People get worked up.
On the news, â€œGender neutral bathrooms. Should be a man and a woman.â€
â€œI donâ€™t wanna shit next to trans person.â€
Whoa, dude. I donâ€™t wanna shit next to anybody, okay?
Iâ€™ve never thought about the type of person Iâ€™m shitting next to.
Whoâ€™s got time to decipher someoneâ€™s background when you gotta take a dump?
If I get diarrhea at a restaurant, I run to the bathroom.
Iâ€™m not like, â€œOh no, a Puerto Rican.â€
â€œAgh!â€
â€œI canâ€™t take a BM next to a PR. What the hell?â€
I agree there should be two bathrooms, not divided by gender.
I think you should divide it by pissing and shitting. Hmm.
I donâ€™t care who Iâ€™m shitting next to as long as theyâ€™re also shitting, right?
But if I walk into the shit room and see a trans person piss, Iâ€™m gonna go, â€œHey, youâ€™d better transition to a shit right now.â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œYouâ€™re in the wrong room, sister.â€
â€œBrother. Whatever.â€
But thereâ€™s a big debate these days.
â€œAre biological women the same as trans women?â€
â€œAre the different? The same? Boopity boop.â€
I think itâ€™s like Coke and Pepsi.
Always that one guy, â€œI love Coke, but I hate Pepsi.â€
â€œAll I gotâ€™s Pepsi.â€
â€œI hate that shit.â€
Hand him a Pepsi, â€œHereâ€™s a Coke.â€ He goes, â€œThis is pretty good.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, you just fucked a trans person.â€
[LAUGHTER]
[WHOOPING, APPLAUSE]
Yeah, itâ€™s all fluid, right?
Thereâ€™ll always be that guy who goes, â€œSome people have no gender.â€
Yeah, thatâ€™s Coke Zero. [CHUCKLES]
But what the hell do I know?
I grew up in the â€™90s. It was like, â€œI donâ€™t see color.â€
â€œWeâ€™re all the same. Treat everybody equally.â€
Now, weâ€™re obsessed with everyoneâ€™s differences.
You flip through HBO Max, itâ€™s all these categories.
â€œTrans Stories.â€
â€œStrong Black Women.â€
â€œAsian Culture.â€
I know youâ€™re trying to be progressive, but pornâ€™s been doing this shit for 30 years.
[LAUGHTER]
Youâ€™re never gonna out-inclusive porn.
All these networks patting themselves on the back.
â€œWe have a gay section.â€
Pornâ€™s like, â€œWe have a gay, senior citizen, dwarf in a wheelchair section.â€
â€œYouâ€™re not more open-minded than us, right?â€
Talk about representation.
Iâ€™ve been watching Asian culture since high school.
HBOâ€™s like, â€œWe have a family section.â€
Pornâ€™s like, â€œWe got that and stepfamily. Come on.â€
But Chicago, gotta be said, beautiful women in this town.
I meanâ€¦
[WHOOPING]
None here. But, uhâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
Iâ€™m joking. Iâ€™ll go down on you.
But, you knowâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
Ladies, you look great. Beautiful.
Definitely the better-looking gender, I think we all agree.
Like, ladies, you guys are even sexy on accident.
You see a woman bend over or see down her shirt for a second.
Youâ€™re like, â€œWhoa!â€ Thatâ€™s a great moment.
You see a guy in short shorts, something pops out.
Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, call the police.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Yeah, the female form, itâ€™s a work of art.
Ladies, you look better the more skin youâ€™re showing.
Bikini, lingerie, mini skirt.
Men look better the more covered up we are.
Business suit, tuxedo, man in uniform.
I think a female strip club should be a guy coming out naked and slowly putting clothing on, you know?
Some ladyâ€™s like, â€œWhoo! Put on that blazer! Yeah!â€
By the end, sheâ€™s like, â€œOh damn, heâ€™s an astronaut.â€ [SIGHS]
Ladies, youâ€™re so hot, you touch your own body in bed.
Youâ€™re on top like, â€œOh yeah.â€
No guy wants to touch himself. No guyâ€™s like, â€œAll right, look at that.â€
No.
â€˜Cause I think youâ€™re more turned on by menâ€™s skills than our actual looks.
Men, weâ€™re all visual.
We go to a strip club, â€œYeah, dance on that pole.â€
At a female strip club, itâ€™s more like, â€œYeah, install that pole.â€ Hey?
[LAUGHTER]
And youâ€™re so mysterious. We have no idea what turns you on.
You know everything that turns us on. We donâ€™t know what you like.
I asked my wife, â€œWhat turns you on?â€ She goes, â€œI like a man who listens.â€
I donâ€™t know. I tuned out. Butâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
Every womanâ€™s different. I asked a friend, â€œWhat turns you on?â€
She goes, â€œI like a man with intelligence.â€
How does that work in the bedroom? Some guyâ€™s like, â€œAh, hypotenuse.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Iâ€™m not a big strip club guy. Iâ€™m too awkward. Iâ€™m not cool.
Some guys are good at strip clubs.
Getting a lap dance, theyâ€™re like, â€œYeah, bitch.â€
Or whatever. I donâ€™t know.
Iâ€™m too awkward.
I was in the back room once, getting a dance.
Ladyâ€™s grinding me. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat do you do?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m a comedian.â€ She goes, â€œTell me a joke.â€
I was like, â€œLook, Iâ€™m not at work. You are.â€
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
She didnâ€™t like that joke.
[WHOOPING]
Yeah.
[APPLAUSE CONTINUES]
But hey, Iâ€™m doing all right.
I had sex with my wife today. Or, as she calls it, microdosing.
And, uhâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
I remember when we got engaged.
She was like, â€œYou gotta post about the engagement.â€
I was like, â€œWhy? This is between us. Who cares about social media?â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œI want people to know.â€
â€œWell, I want you to post about that threesome we had.â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhy would I do that?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI want people to know.â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œAre you kidding? This is a bond between two people.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œThis is better, itâ€™s a bond between three.â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ve been dreaming about this since I was a kid.â€
I was like, â€œAhâ€¦â€
A lot of girls dream about a wedding. A lot of boys dream about a threesome.
And the dream is very similar.
Who weâ€™ll invite, where weâ€™ll do it, and we gotta get a photographer.
[LAUGHTER]
Sheâ€™s a great egg, but I can always find a new way to piss her off.
Touched her stomach the other day, she flipped out.
Sheâ€™s got a nice stomach, just self-conscious about it.
People talk about private parts, like boobs are a private part.
I walk in a room, grab my girlâ€™s boobs, sheâ€™s like, â€œHey, how are ya?â€
I grab her stomach, sheâ€™s like, â€œYou wanna fucking die today?â€
Thatâ€™s a private part, right?
In the bedroom, sheâ€™ll cover it up so I canâ€™t see it.
Which I get, â€™cause I feel the same way about my butt hole.
I donâ€™t want anybody seeing that thing.
Even after wild sex, I still have to walk out of the room backwards.
The stomach for a woman is the butt hole for a man.
The condition of both is very dependent on diet.
[LAUGHTER, WHOOPING]
Sheâ€™ll be like, â€œI canâ€™t hook up, I had a burrito.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œSame here.â€
But, like any couple, we fight. We got into it last week.
Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m gonna level with you. I need more compliments.â€
I was like, â€œOh shit.â€ So I took her to a construction site. Oh.
But it gets confusing.
We were walking around and a homeless guy catcalled her.
â€œNice ass, baby!â€
I was like, â€œThere you go, huh?â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat are you gonna do about that guy?â€
â€œIâ€™m gonna go over and give that guy a couple of bucks.â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t want a compliment from him.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œA complimentâ€™s a compliment.â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ll take you to a gay bar, see how you like it.â€
We go to a gay bar, guys are all over me.
â€œWhat do you think about that?â€ I was like, â€œI fucking love it.â€ Soâ€¦
So that backfired, you know?
The new fight is, I bought a vintage car. She hates this car.
She goes, â€œI think you like the car more than you like me.â€
Itâ€™s not that I like it more, itâ€™s just easier to understand.
Letâ€™s be honest, ladies. You can be vague and secretive.
Carâ€™s pretty cut and dry.
Out of gas? Empty. Overheated? Hot. Thereâ€™s no game for the car.
The engine of a car has never caught on fire and the dashboard says, â€œIâ€™m fine.â€
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
Hmm.
[WHOOPING]
Yeah. I donâ€™t know.
[WHISTLING]
Men compare women to cars all the time. Ladies, youâ€™re the opposite of a car.
Your car is quiet, itâ€™s running great. Girlfriendâ€™s quiet, youâ€™re in deep shit.
Girlfriends and cars have nothing in common.
Except for the fact that my last one was stolen by a Black guy.
[GROANS]
[LAUGHTER]
I think men are more like cars.
Weâ€™re gassy, weâ€™re fixer-uppers. We kill people sometimes, right?
And, ladies, if we stop working, you can just go electric.
[IMITATES BUZZING]
I think men are more like cars. Ladies, youâ€™re more like horses.
Beautiful creatures, long legs, ponytail.
Expensive to feed, always need new shoes, we slap you on the ass, and once we see you take a shit, the magicâ€™s over. Butâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
But we got some couples here tonight, huh?
There you go. You guys swing?
No. Umâ€¦
You can tell youâ€™re close with your lady when she starts farting around you.
I think thatâ€™s the true test.
And I get it, ladies. Itâ€™s a biological function.
But can we keep it under ten a day? What do you think?
You donâ€™t want that to become your thing.
Youâ€™re at a party. â€œWho ripped one?â€ â€œClassic Claire.â€
[CHUCKLES] â€œEvery time.â€
Farting for a womanâ€™s a tough look.
Farting for a woman is like crying for a man.
We all pretend to be open-minded, but that shitâ€™s a bummer, you know?
[LAUGHTER]
The other day, I was going down on her. She farted, I started crying.
She was like, â€œAw, you need a tissue?â€
I was like, â€œDo you?â€
[LAUGHTER]
What about fartâ€™s wacky cousin, queef?
Yes.
[CHEERING]
Love a good queef.
[WHOOPING]
A lot of ladies get self-conscious, embarrassed.
I say queef it up, sister. Itâ€™s nice to see that thing talking for once.
Love a queef. Big fan of the queef.
I went down on a girl once, she queefed, my hair wentâ€¦ [EXHALES]
Itâ€™s a hell of a time. You know what a queefâ€™s like?
Itâ€™s like when the subway goes by and you get that dirty air, you know?
Sure, itâ€™s not the most sanitary, but itâ€™s hot down there, itâ€™s refreshing, goddammit!
Iâ€™m pro-queef.
But you gotta be empathetic to the queefs, fellas.
Ladies, youâ€™re more empathetic, more thoughtful.
You think about others. Men donâ€™t think about others.
We think about ourselves, you know?
I go to dinner with my girl, she says, â€œCanâ€™t eat here, the chefâ€™s homophobic.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œGreat, weâ€™re not gay. Weâ€™re good.â€ Yeah?
Thatâ€™s how I think. Men donâ€™t think about others.
I was watching tennis with my buddy. I go, â€œYou know this guy hit his wife?â€
My friend goes, â€œYeah, heâ€™s got a great backhand.â€
Jesus Christ.
Youâ€™re deeper, ladies. More emotionally intelligent.
Ask a woman what she likes in a guy, sheâ€™ll tell you what she likes because of how it makes her feel. â€œI like guys who are strong. I feel safe.â€
â€œI like guys with money. I feel taken care of.â€
Guys tell you what we like, not how we feel.
â€œWhat do you like in a woman?â€
â€œA fat ass.â€
â€œHmm. Howâ€™s that make you feel?â€
â€œHard? I donâ€™t know.â€
Gotta be tough to be a lady in a lot of ways.
Some perks, ladies, you know.
Like, youâ€™re allowed to announce your standards in public.
When men announce their standards, we look shittier.
I was hanging out with some friends. Weâ€™re drinking. Talking about our type.
My gay friend was like, â€œI like muscles on a man.â€
All right, gay guy, muscles.
My lady friend, â€œI like a tall guy.â€ Yeah, women like tall guys.
â€œWhat do you like, Mark?â€ â€œSkinny girls with big tits.â€
They all went, â€œOh, what a fucking asshole.â€
â€œHow come youâ€™re allowed to shame me for what Iâ€™m attracted to?â€
â€œYou guys were shallow. Why canâ€™t I be?â€
â€œYou like tall guys. Iâ€™m not a tall guy. I wasnâ€™t like, â€˜Classic whore.'â€
Iâ€™d rather be taller but thatâ€™s my issue.
Sheâ€™s like, â€œItâ€™s messed up you wonâ€™t sleep with certain women.â€
â€œWhat about the gay guy? He wonâ€™t fuck any women. Yell at him.â€
[LAUGHTER]
You wanna be a good guy, it just gets confusing.
Ladies, where are we at on objectifying women? Is that bad?
Itâ€™s tough. Some women say, â€œDonâ€™t ever objectify a woman.â€
But ladies, you do it all day long.
Any time a woman posts on Instagram, every girlâ€™s like, â€œBeautiful.â€ â€œStunning.â€ â€œSexy.â€
Never seen a woman write, â€œSmart.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Huh. Interesting.
Ladies, you donâ€™t like when men objectify women if theyâ€™re hot. But if theyâ€™re traditionally unattractive, you love it.
Smoking hot girl walks in. â€œDamn, sheâ€™s sexy as hell.â€
â€œEasy, creep.â€
If a lady rolls in on a scooter with an eye patch, â€œDamn, sheâ€™s sexy as hell.â€
â€œThis is a great guy right here.â€
Isnâ€™t he still a creep? If youâ€™re not threatened, youâ€™re on board.
A guy puts up a poster in his cubicle, big breasted swimsuit models,
â€œJeez, you pig.â€ â€œOh no, theyâ€™re trans.â€
â€œHey, good for you.â€
[LAUGHTER]
But isnâ€™t he still a pig?
â€œIs that a Victoriaâ€™s Secret poster?â€ â€œYeah, itâ€™s the one with Downâ€™s syndrome.â€
â€œOh, carry on. Carry on.â€
[GROANING]
Like, why does that make it okay?
How about that, a Victoriaâ€™s Secret model with Downâ€™s syndrome. Thatâ€™s exciting.
Yeah, sheâ€™s really pretty. I mean, Iâ€™d go downs on her.
You know.
[LAUGHTER]
Good for her. I support. Iâ€™m on board. Iâ€™m a fan.
I feel bad for the girl who didnâ€™t get the job.
â€œWho got it?â€ â€œYou donâ€™t wanna know.â€
â€œKill yourself. Get out of town. Change career. Donâ€™t tell anybody.â€
But I also understand, ladies.
Youâ€™ve been held down by your looks for generations. That sucks.
My brotherâ€™s got a cute little daughter. My mom got her a Barbie.
The wifeâ€™s like, â€œNo daughter of mine is playing with Barbie.â€
â€œWhy not?â€ â€œBarbie sets unrealistic body standards for girls.â€
Of course Barbieâ€™s unrealistic. Thatâ€™s why kids like her.
Nobody wants a realistic toy.
Like every man toy. Twelve-pack, huge arms, giant legs. Theyâ€™re toys.
â€œSheâ€™s gonna think she has to look like her.â€ No, sheâ€™s not.
Iâ€™ve never heard of a girl with a Barbie, â€œDamn, guess I gotta cut off my nipples.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Girls arenâ€™t stupid.
I get it. Itâ€™s a new day. Gotta be inclusive.
Gotta have plus-size Barbie, Chinese Barbie, blind Barbie.
You know whoâ€™s never changed? Ken. Huh.
Kenâ€™s a good-looking guy, full head of hair.
Thereâ€™s no bald Ken, drunk Ken, abusive Ken.
Nobody wants a realistic Ken.
He pulls up in the Dream Car, gets a DUI.
Barbieâ€™s like, â€œI told you so.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œShut up, you fucking skank. Iâ€™ll kill youâ€
Nobody wants that.
[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]
Yeah.
[CHEERING, WHISTLING]
If you ask me, Ken is quietly the most inclusive, â€™cause heâ€™ll fuck any Barbie. He doesnâ€™t give a shit.
â€œWhat is that? Wheelchair Barbie? Yeah, roll her over here, I donâ€™t care.â€
Now, thatâ€™s inclusive.
I wouldâ€™ve killed for a Barbie growing up.
My parents wouldnâ€™t buy us any cool toys. They bought us board games. [GROANS]
Even the names of board games are a bummer.
Sorry. Right?
Trouble. Operation.
And the saddest of all, Life.
[GROANS]
What kind of twisted, messed up game for a kid is Life?
Lifeâ€™s hard, life sucks.
You play games to escape life, not dive right in.
You got a kid outdoors, playing with his friends.
You drag him inside to play a game about mortgage and divorce?
[GROANS] Thatâ€™s too real.
â€œPick a card, Timmy. Whatâ€™d you get?â€ â€œI got herpes.â€
â€œIt says you sent a tweet ten years ago that came back to haunt you.â€
â€œYouâ€™re fired.â€
â€œMan, life sucks.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Hate a board game. Remember Clue? I hated Clue.
Professor Plum in the study with the candlestick.
Thatâ€™s not relatable. Whoâ€™s dying from a candlestick?
You gotta update that stuff. Make it stuff that kills people now.
Peanuts.
[LAUGHTER]
Gender reveal party.
Fentanyl. Cops.
Update it. Mark Normand in the hotel room under the BBW.
[LAUGHTER]
Thatâ€™s how I wanna go.
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]
Yeah.
I did mention Fentanyl. We have an opioid crisis.
[MAN WHOOPS]
Nobody seems to give a shit.
That guyâ€™s hopped up. Yeah.
[LAUGHTER]
Yeah.
Yeah. When I was a kid, all I heard was weed was the gateway drug.
Remember? â€œWeed is the gateway drug.â€
I disagree. I think itâ€™s cereal.
All that sugar? Cerealâ€™s getting kids high way younger than weed.
Kids look like addicts when they wake up.
â€œDamn, I need a bowl.â€
I mean, diabetes, obesity. We pump that shit into kids early.
Thatâ€™s why half the cereals are named after drugs.
Smacks. Right?
Special K. You know?
Golden Grahams. Already dealing in grams. I donâ€™t know.
If you go down the cereal aisle in Australia or Europe, itâ€™s all health food. Heart healthy. Wholegrain. Fiber.
The cereal aisle in America is like a fucking acid trip, right?
Itâ€™s just bright colors and wacky cartoon characters.
Every cereal mascot looks like a cracked-out addict, you know?
You got a paranoid leprechaun and a jacked-up rabbit stealing shit from kids.
Tony the Tigerâ€™s clearly coked-up.
[STRAINED] â€œTheyâ€™re great, yeah!â€
How about that wide-eyed toucan? â€œHey, kids. Follow your nose.â€
[CHUCKLES]
Yeah.
I know fentanyl and opioid and all that stuffâ€™s dark.
I like dark humor. Some people get upset. Everybodyâ€™s entitled to their opinion.
To each his anal.
But, you know. Youâ€™ve gotta admit, though, if weâ€™re a society that gets upset about jokes, thatâ€™s a sign we got it pretty goddamn good, you know.
Guy in Ukraineâ€™s getting his face shot. We got people here like, â€œZingers, ugh.â€
Always blows my mind when somebody gets really upset about comedy.
I told a joke, this guy got pissed. He goes, â€œApologize for that joke.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œSorry?â€ He goes, â€œYou didnâ€™t mean that.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI didnâ€™t mean the joke either, you queef.â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œWhat are we doing here?â€
[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]
But, you know, maybe itâ€™s me.
Maybe itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m too literal. Literal guy.
Definitely hurt me in some social interactions, you know.
Just last week, I was at a party. Girl comes up to me.
She goes, â€œAre you gay?â€ â€œNah, Iâ€™m not gay.â€
She goes, â€œWhoa. Nothing wrong with being gayâ€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI know. Just saying Iâ€™m not.â€
â€œYouâ€™re getting defensive.â€ â€œWell, Iâ€™m not gay.â€
â€œThereâ€™s nothing wrong with it.â€ â€œI know, but Iâ€™m not.â€
She wouldnâ€™t let it go. I got annoyed. I go, â€œAre you pregnant?â€
â€œScrew you. Iâ€™m not pregnant.â€ â€œNothing wrong with being pregnant.â€
[LAUGHTER]
But we made up eventually.
Weâ€™re cool now, you know.
She was like, â€œI should be honest.â€
â€œI was pregnant for about three months in college.â€
I was like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s when I was gay.â€
[LAUGHTER]
But, you know, Iâ€™m an idiot.
Bad socially.
I had a Tinder date ten years ago. Great date.
One of those magical nights, everything clicked.
Went back to her place. Fooling around, naked, giggling.
She goes, â€œYour Tinder pic, you look like a serial killer.â€
I was like, â€œDamn, thatâ€™s not good.â€ Took the wind out of my sails.
She goes, â€œWhat did you think of my pic?â€ â€œI thought you looked easy.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Thatâ€™s what she did. She flipped out. She went nuts.
â€œWhy are you mad? Nothing wrong with being easy.â€
â€œSerial killer? Way worse.â€ Right?
â€œYou said I look like I murder people. I said you look fun.â€
â€œWhy are you mad? I should be mad at you.â€
I didnâ€™t get it. Then I realized, Iâ€™m not a serial killer.
[LAUGHTER]
She is easy.
[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]
Thatâ€™s when I realized you canâ€™t say what someone is to them.
Thatâ€™s mean. I learned that that night. You canâ€™t say what someone is to them.
Iâ€™d never call a retarded person retarded. Thatâ€™s just mean.
Iâ€™d call my friend retarded, â€™cause heâ€™s not retarded.
If a friend spilled Pepsi on my laptop. â€œWhat are you doing, you retard?â€
If a retarded kid spilled Pepsi on my laptop, Iâ€™d be like, â€œBubbles. Yay.â€
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m not an asshole. Iâ€™m learning.
â€œBy the way, I went on a date with a girl that looks easy.â€
â€œYou went on a date with a guy that looks like a killer.â€
â€œWhat, are you fucking retarded?â€
[LAUGHTER, CHEERING]
Hmm.
[APPLAUSE, WHOOPING]
But I didnâ€™t mean to insult the lady, you know.
â€œYou got a problem with easy women?â€ â€œIâ€™m here. What are you talking about?â€
I think itâ€™s crazy.
Itâ€™s 2023. We still make women feel bad for being promiscuous.
Sluts are the best, right?
Why make them feel bad?
The best time to be a promiscuous woman was Native American times.
Inca, Aztec, Mayan.
They used to sacrifice virgins to the gods. Throw them in a volcano.
Holy shit. Iâ€™d be the biggest tramp on the reservation.
It could save your life.
Chief walks up. â€œMaâ€™am, crops are dying. We gotta sacrifice a virgin.â€
â€œAre you a virgin?â€ â€œNo, huge whore.â€
â€œHuge whore.â€
â€œYou are way off, baby. Way off, all right?â€
â€œI give the best arrowhead on this side of the wigwam, okay?â€
â€œYou donâ€™t know what youâ€™re dealing with. I put the â€˜hoâ€™ in Navajo out here, okay?â€
Yeah, you know my tribe name, Spread Eagle? Thatâ€™s me.
Yeah.
I think I like that system better.
Reward the fun gals, get rid of the boring ones.
You know there was some chief up on the volcano going, â€œYou shouldâ€™ve fucked me.â€
â€œWhoa. Hey. All right. Shit. Look at that.â€
Nothing wrong with being promiscuous.
Donâ€™t let anybody make you feel bad about that.
But, ladies, you gotta own being sluts. Sometimes you slut-shame yourselves.
Thatâ€™s not gonna help the movement, huh?
You have sex with a girl. Youâ€™re like, â€œI gotta go.â€
â€œYouâ€™re gonna leave? I feel like a whore.â€
Itâ€™s like, â€œYeah, you are.â€
â€œAnd thatâ€™s okay.â€
â€œI donâ€™t want you to think Iâ€™m a slut.â€ â€œNo, I knew.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with it, remember?
You canâ€™t tell people not to slut-shame and do it to yourself.
It kills me when I see women trashing promiscuous women.
â€œHow about Rachel? What a whore.â€ â€œWhat do you mean?â€
â€œShe fucks a new guy every weekend.â€ â€œSo what? What do you do?â€
Every girl goes, â€œI get dinner and drinks out of him. Spend some money first.â€
â€œWait, youâ€™re calling her a whore and youâ€™re a prostitute.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Isnâ€™t that weirder? Sheâ€™s banging guys she likes for free.
Youâ€™re like, â€œHow much lobster can I get with this clam?â€
Isnâ€™t that way whorier?
I donâ€™t know.
What do I know? Iâ€™m a feminist.
But, you know.
[LAUGHTER]
A lot of prostitutes walk around my neighborhood.
Youâ€™re supposed to say sex worker now, but Iâ€™ve given enough money, I should be able to call them whatever I want. Butâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
Sex is just such a strange thing.
We all have sex. We like sex. You guys have sex.
Please, send me a video.
You know, sex is fun. We like it.
If you charge for it, all of a sudden thereâ€™s a stigma.
Weird. Sex is the only thing on earth that gets sadder when you go pro.
Huh.
Nothing else is like that.
Maybe bowling.
Hmm.
â€œMy friendâ€™s a great bowler.â€ â€œThatâ€™s cool.â€
â€œMy other friendâ€™s a professional bowler.â€ â€œThatâ€™s a shame.â€
Either way, bowling or prostitution, holes are getting fingered in an alley.
[LAUGHTER]
Yeah.
Yeah, Iâ€™ve been with a lot of promiscuous gals in my day.
Paid for a couple of big old aborshes.
Thatâ€™s a thing, you know.
One time I left the abortion clinic with a lady and thereâ€™s a guy protesting.
He goes, â€œYouâ€™re a goddamn murderer.â€
I donâ€™t know about murderer. I really more just hired a hitman.
[LAUGHTER]
Heâ€™s like, â€œIf it was up to me, youâ€™d be in jail.â€
If I go to jail for this, I want murderer status.
I wanna look tough.
The guys talking. â€œWhat are you in for?â€ â€œGrand theft auto.â€ â€œAssault.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œMurder.â€
Theyâ€™re like, â€œDamn! Whoâ€™d you kill?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œHuh! A relative.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhoa, whyâ€™d you do that?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œCaught him inside my girl.â€
[CHUCKLES]
I miss that gal. She was fun, she was wild.
After the abortion, she was like, â€œWe should celebrate with a drink.â€
I was like, â€œI donâ€™t think you should drink on an empty stomach.â€
[LAUGHTER, GROANING]
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
Ah. All right.
[WHISTLING]
Yeah.
But, you know, itâ€™s good you guys can come out for a yuk.
I know times are weird. The economyâ€™s in the toilet.
Gas prices are higher than Hunter Biden.
Who knows whatâ€™s going on out there, you know?
All my friends are broke.
One of my friends is broke but still buys the most crap.
He just bought a Peloton.
You ever see one of these things?
Three grand for this thing.
Imagine explaining a Peloton to someone in a Third World country.
Some guy with no shoes on, on a dirt road, shabby clothes.
â€œWhoa, you spent $3,000 on a bike? Must be pretty fast.â€
â€œDoesnâ€™t move. Just sits in the living room.â€
â€œIn the living room? When you pedal, it generates power for your home?â€
â€œNo. Uses a lot of power. Got a big screen on the front.â€
â€œBig screen? When you use it, you watch funny TV shows?â€
â€œNo, a better-looking person yells at you.â€
â€œOh. This thing sounds terrible. Whatâ€™s the upside?â€
â€œYou eat too much takeout, you gotta burn some calories.â€
â€œWhoa, whoa. Whatâ€™s takeout?â€
â€œThatâ€™s where a guy on a bicycle brings food to your house and you pay him.â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œWait. This guyâ€™s got a real bike and you give him money? Why not do that?â€
[SCOFFS] â€œWhat am I? A fucking immigrant? Come on.â€
Thatâ€™s America. Yeah.
Any immigrants here tonight?
[WHOOPING]
Hey, how are you? Where you from?
China.
[MARK] China? All right. Sorry about the balloons. But, um, all right. Good one. Good to have you. Thank you. Just donâ€™t cough.
[MAN] Ireland.
Ireland? I was hoping for something browner.
All right, okay.
[LAUGHTER]
Thanks for being here. And you seem sober, which is shocking.
All right.
[MAN] Pakistan.
Pakistan? Hey, hopefully only one of us bombs.
I donâ€™t even know if thatâ€™s a thing. Umâ€¦
Mexicans? Are you Mexican, sir?
[WHOOPING]
Yeah, youâ€™d look cute in a cage. All right.
Somebody check his papers, huh? All right.
Sorry, that was a spicy one.
Good to have you. Sorry, sir. That joke was over the line.
And so are you. But, uhâ€¦
Iâ€™m jealous of immigrants, I really am. My buddyâ€™s a Mexican immigrant. Been here eight years. He loves America. He never thinks about the bad parts. We got a lot of bad history. Slavery, Civil Rights, oppressing women, homophobia. Heâ€™s like, â€œI just got here.â€ [LAUGHS]
What a great position to be in.
All the fun of America, not much of the hardship. Itâ€™s like becoming a firefighter on September 12th.
[LAUGHTER]
Immigrants are great. Immigrants tend to appreciate America more than most Americans.
Iâ€™m from here, born and raised. Iâ€™m spoiled. I take it for granted. My grandparents are immigrants from Sicily. They never shut up. The American dream, the freedom, the opportunity. And Iâ€™m like, â€œWhere the fuckâ€™s my Uber Eats?â€ â€œWhere the hell is that Pakistani with my food, goddammit?â€
Yeah. But I thought that was the big dream. You come to America, you make it big, you make a couple of bucks, you get rich. Boy, the rich thing is weird now. Feels like we hate rich people. Isnâ€™t that weird? See that online a lot. â€œFuck the rich, kill the rich, eat the rich.â€
Why are we all shitting on the thing we wanna be?
Like making fun of old people.
â€œLook at that old bastard. Probably shit his pants.â€
Yeah, thatâ€™s the goal.
Weâ€™re all hypocrites.
We all go to 7-Eleven, â€œGimme that scratch-off.â€
Guy goes by in a Ferrari. [IMITATES CAR]
â€œRich prick. Come on, big money.â€
Which one is it? All of my friends are very left-leaning, liberal, â€œDown with hate, we gotta stop hate. But fuck rich people.â€
â€œThat feels pretty hateful.â€ â€œWell, I hate the 1%.â€
Like, â€œWhoa, so you hate minorities?â€
Weâ€™re all so compassionate these days till someoneâ€™s doing better than you, then fuck them.
Rich guyâ€™s like, â€œMy beach house burned down in Malibu.â€
â€œBoo-fucking-hoo.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œWell, my kids were in there.â€
â€œI donâ€™t get it. I invented something, now I donâ€™t have feelings? Weird.â€
All these absolutes now. â€œRich people are all evil.â€
Thatâ€™s not how people work. They vary. Some are evil, some are nice.
â€œCops are all bad.â€ No, some are bad, some are awesome.
â€œTeachers are heroes.â€ Some are heroes, some fuck their students.
Right?
[LAUGHTER]
And that student is a hero.
[LAUGHTER]
Yeah. All right.
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
I donâ€™t hate any group. I like all the groups, you know?
I also like racial jokes.
Yeah, those kind of went away.
I grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood.
Weâ€™d say horrible things to each other. Everybody got along.
You canâ€™t make those jokes anymore, and we seem more tense than ever.
It was fun. Cut the tension, you know?
Theyâ€™d be like, â€œMark, you canâ€™t dance.â€ I was like, â€œWell, you canâ€™t swim. Ah!â€
Weâ€™re still friends to this day.
Then some stiff white guy, â€œYou canâ€™t say that.â€
You donâ€™t know our relationship. Thatâ€™s what we do.
You walk in on me choking my wife. â€œCall the police.â€ No, she loves that.
[LAUGHTER]
You donâ€™t always know the relationship.
Weâ€™re just so obsessed with race now, itâ€™s always on my mind.
On the phone with my insurance agent. â€œWhat colorâ€™s your car?â€
I was like, â€œJeez. I thought you were progressive.â€
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
And, look, Iâ€™m a pretty progressive guy.
But sometimes we get so progressive these days
we actually end up kinda racist again.
I used to just have my friend. Now Iâ€™m very aware heâ€™s my Black friend.
â€œDonâ€™t say anything stupid. Donâ€™t offend him.â€ Thatâ€™s not progress.
Iâ€™m obsessed with his skin color now. Never thought about it before.
Everything I say, Iâ€™m second-guessing.
â€œYouâ€™re always banging your girlfriend. Youâ€™re like a sex slave.â€
Ah, shit. Ah.
â€œNo, Iâ€™m just saying, you know, youâ€™re whipped.â€
Ah, damn.
â€œNo, I mean, you know, I just wanna hang.â€
[GROANS]
Heâ€™s like, â€œScrew this, Iâ€™m outta here.â€
â€œAll right, Iâ€™ll see you later.â€ Jesus Christ. Holy Hell.
Thatâ€™s not healthy.
Hope no Jews are offended. We got any Jews here?
[WHOOPING, WHISTLING]
Hey, all right!
Get â€™em!
[LAUGHTER]
Just joking, Jews. Thanks for coming out. Love the tribe. And do something about this weather, will you?
Yeah.
[LAUGHTER]
I love the Jews.
My Jewish friends and my Black friends butt heads a lot over who had it worse.
Thatâ€™s a big argument. Slavery or the Holocaust?
Got heated one night, almost came to blows.
My Black friend had to be like, â€œWeâ€™ve got stuff in common.â€
â€œLetâ€™s focus on that. Weâ€™re both oppressed.â€
â€œBoth contribute a lot to the arts, and our grandparents are both ashy.â€
[LAUGHTER, GROANING]
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]
Just saying, Jews and Black people, a lot in common.
I go to my Black friendâ€™s house, closetâ€™s got a big pile of shoes.
Go to the Holocaust Museum, thereâ€™s a big pile ofâ€¦ You get it.
But, no.
Big fan of the Jews. I hate to see the anti-Semitism bubbling up these days.
Thatâ€™s a bummer. Some people arenâ€™t having it.
I heard one guy go, â€œThese Jews are acting like babies.â€
â€œThese Jews are acting like babies.â€
I disagree. I think Jews are tough, I think theyâ€™re resilient.
I do, however, think babies are acting like Jews.
Yeah.
[LAUGHTER]
I was at a diner last week with my buddy. Heâ€™s Jewish.
A baby one table over. They were doing the same shit.
Both wearing little hats, you know.
Babyâ€™s uncomfortable, squirming. I look at my friend, heâ€™s like, â€œMy back.â€
The bill came, they both shit their pants and left.
But, you know, I make jokes, but I try to be a good honky ally to my Black brethren.
An awkward moment for a white guy is going to see a slave movie with your Black friend.
Awkward. Did that a few years back. Still haunts me.
Hanging out with two Black guys. â€œWe should see a movie.â€ â€œHell, yeah.â€
â€œWe should go see 12 Years A Slave.â€ I was like, â€œAh. Iâ€™ll get the tickets.â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œItâ€™s on me.â€
We had to see 12 Years A Slave in Harlem in the theater.
Iâ€™m the only white guy in there. Iâ€™m so uncomfortable, Iâ€™m shaking.
My friendâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s your problem?â€ â€œI want to leave, but I canâ€™t.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œNow you know how the slaves felt.â€
God damn.
Heâ€™s like, â€œWe did 400 years. You can do two hours.â€
I was like, â€œYes, Master.â€ [CHUCKLES]
And that is how I made slavery about me.
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
Thatâ€™s what white people do. Yeah.
But I think weâ€™re making progress.
Weâ€™ve got a Black mermaid now. Thatâ€™s big. Yeah.
Canâ€™t have a Jewish mermaid, â€™cause you guys canâ€™t fuck with shellfish.
But, you know.
[LAUGHTER]
Weâ€™ve got a Black mermaid. Theyâ€™re making more.
Pixarâ€™s doing a Rapunzel movie.
â€œRapunzel, let down your hair.â€ Rapunzelâ€™s gonna be Black.
Which is cool. But the Prince is gonna be white.
Gonna be awkward when he goes, â€œRapunzel, let down your hair.â€
And sheâ€™s gonna be like, â€œYouâ€™re not touching this shit.â€
But it is horrible when you see some real racism go down.
I was on the bus last week. Black guy tried to get on the bus.
Driverâ€™s like, â€œWeâ€™re full, buddy.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m just trying to get on the bus.â€
He goes, â€œYouâ€™re treating me like this â€™cause Iâ€™m Black.â€
Iâ€™m like, man, that is messed up to treat someone differently â€™cause theyâ€™re Black.
Then I realized, wait a minute, we all do that.
Black guy says the n-word, no big deal.
White lady, you say the n-word, I get an erection.
You know.
[LAUGHTER]
But sometimes you should treat groups differently, you know?
If my white friendâ€™s getting wild, â€œDude, youâ€™re crazy. Youâ€™re an animal.â€
If my Black friendâ€™s getting wild, Iâ€™m like, â€œDude.â€
â€œYouâ€™re crazy.â€ [CHUCKLES]
Iâ€™m way nicer to Black people than I am to white people.
I was at the gym, white guy playing his music really loud.
Weâ€™re all like, â€œItâ€™s a public space. Itâ€™s rude. Get the hell out of here.â€
He leaves. Twenty minutes later, a Black guy comes in.
He starts playing his music really loud. Weâ€™re all like, â€œGood tunes, brother.â€
[LAUGHTER]
I had a guy go, â€œYou do that â€™cause youâ€™re scared of Black people.â€
Iâ€™m not scared of Black people. Iâ€™m scared of cell phone cameras.
That is terrifying, you know?
At a restaurant, a Black guyâ€™s like, â€œI got you.â€
Like, â€œWhoa. I said vinegar. Vinegar. What the hell?â€
â€œSalt and vinegar.â€
Thatâ€™s a dicey one.
I like a dicey zinger. Some people get weird.
You know who doesnâ€™t like dicey jokes? TV writers.
Theyâ€™ve turned down everything I ever pitched.
I pitched this great sitcom about the 9/11 terrorists, but of course, they shot down the pilot.
But, you know.
[LAUGHTER]
I know.
You guys are fun. A lot of crowds are sensitive.
People are getting sensitive. My buddy is a vegan. Holy shit.
Iâ€™m walking on eggshells around him. He really hates that.
Heâ€™s a great guy, but going out to eat with him is a nightmare.
Heâ€™s got to have the Impossible Burger. You know about this?
Looks like meat, tastes like meat, feels like meat, but itâ€™s not meat.
Weird. You hate something but want something just like it. Huh.
Itâ€™s like a lesbian with a strap-on.
[LAUGHTER]
You hate dick, but it looks like a dick, feels like a dick.
I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s not dick.
Itâ€™s beyond dick.
We got any lesbians here tonight?
[WHOOPING]
Hey, all right.
I think that was a guy. Uhâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
Lesbians are underrepresented.
I travel the country doing comedy. I see gay bars everywhere.
They always have funny names, like The Manhole or The Back Door.
Whereâ€™s all the fun lesbian bars? Whereâ€™s Clitz, with a z?
Clitz. Perfect name for a lesbian bar, â€™cause no guy could find it.
[LAUGHTER]
And weâ€™ll put it right in the hood. Aha.
[BELCHES]
All right. Yeah.
[CHEERING]
Comedy. All right.
[WHISTLING, APPLAUSE]
But, hey, itâ€™s good you guys are out now, â€™cause youâ€™re not watching the news. Too much news.
The news is dark. Itâ€™s on 24/7.
The news is more twisted than ever. Saw a news headline the other day.
â€œTransgender inmate impregnates female prisoner.â€
I was like, â€œWow.â€
â€œWhere is that porn?â€
[LAUGHTER]
Iâ€™ve been watching porn my whole life, never saw a title that creative, right?
Man, the news is dark. The news is more fucked-up than porn now.
And itâ€™s on everywhere. Every airport, bar, restaurant.
Put some porn on. I think weâ€™d be in a better mood.
I was at the Amtrak station the other day. There was news on the wall, on TV.
â€œMan attacks multiple people on trains.â€
Jeez, Iâ€™m about to get on an Amtrak.
Put some porn on, thatâ€™d be better.
Then itâ€™s, â€œMan runs a train on multiple people.â€
All right! Now Iâ€™m ready to board. Choo-choo. [LAUGHS]
The news is crazy. Isnâ€™t it weird we have two news channels in America that tell you two completely different news?
How did that happen? Just tell me the news.
I donâ€™t want your spin or bias.
Thank God we donâ€™t do that with the weather.
Wouldnâ€™t that be insane, if we had political, opinionated weather?
Weâ€™re going to the beach tomorrow, letâ€™s check the left-wing weather.
Boop.
â€œHey, folks. 90 degrees outside. Beautiful day for an abortion.â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œWe got some dark clouds coming in. Excuse me, clouds of color.â€
â€œAnd, as you can see, weâ€™ve got tropical storm Kelly brewing.â€
â€œSlowly transitions to Hurricane Kevin, but we donâ€™t judge.â€
â€œWeâ€™re not sure what the future holds, but itâ€™s female. Back to you, they/them.â€
Holy moly, I was just trying to get the goddamn weather.
That was weird. I got nothing out of that. All right.
Letâ€™s check the right-wing weather. Maybe that will be more informative.
Boop.
â€œHey, folks. Grab your boots, itâ€™s 100% chance of storming the Capitol.â€
â€œOh yeah. Gonna be a lot of hailing and heiling out there, andâ€¦â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œWe got some ice in the Midwest.â€
â€œWe need some ICE at the border, Iâ€™ll tell you that right now.â€
â€œGrab your coats, â€™cause we hate snowflakes. Ooh!â€
â€œPraise the Lord, and back to you, sugar tits.â€
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
Uh-huh.
All right.
Yeah, the news, itâ€™s all politics now.
Iâ€™m so sick of politics. Itâ€™s the new sports team.
People make it their whole personality. Itâ€™s fricking exhausting. Yeah.
I look at politicians the same way I look at CBD gummies.
A lot of people believe in them, but Iâ€™m not sure they do anything.
They donâ€™t fix problems anymore, just change the name.
â€œWeâ€™re not in a recession, itâ€™s a financial hiccup.â€
What? Weâ€™re all broke.
The banks are failing. What are you talking about?
They do it with everything. â€œHeâ€™s not obese, heâ€™s a person of size.â€
What? Heâ€™s fat as shit.
[LAUGHTER]
â€œHeâ€™s not homeless, heâ€™s unhoused.â€
He just diarrhea-d on my porch.
Like, who cares what weâ€™re calling it. Letâ€™s fix it.
How long till bad guys start doing that? â€œIâ€™m not racist, Iâ€™m ethnically choosy.â€
Hmm?
â€œIâ€™m not a school shooter, Iâ€™m a student body minimizer.â€
Huh?
[APPLAUSE, LAUGHTER]
Ah, school shootings.
Itâ€™s a problem.
Itâ€™s a problem in this country. I was just in Canada.
Theyâ€™re nicer than us. They donâ€™t shoot each other.
They stab. Isnâ€™t that nice? Itâ€™s kinda romantic.
We shoot in America. More efficient.
Shooting somebody is like breaking up via text. Easy, no mess.
Stabbing is like breaking up in person.
You see that look in their eye. â€œI know. This is hard for me too.â€
Get back to your buddy, â€œHowâ€™d it go?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œShe fucking freaked out.â€
[LAUGHTER]
Another reason women are better than men, you donâ€™t see a lot of female school shooters.
Whatâ€™s going on there? I googled it, thereâ€™s been two.
Huh. Anybody ever heard of them?
Isnâ€™t that weird? Whether itâ€™s gun violence or the WNBAâ€¦
[LAUGHTER]
â€¦nobodyâ€™s watching these female shooters.
Man or woman.
Gotta put up some more numbers, ladies.
[APPLAUSE]
I think I can solve school shootings.
I know people love guns. Itâ€™s America, people wanna buy a gun.
But I think if a high-school kid buys a semiautomatic weapon, that should be a big deal. That should be public.
Letâ€™s make that an event, like a wedding.
You gotta send invitations, get your family to the gun shop.
The shop owner, heâ€™s like the priest.
He holds up the gun, â€œIf anyone has any objections, speak now, or this guy will forever own this piece.â€
And we get some feedback.
â€œIâ€™m his uncle. I donâ€™t think he should have that gun â€™cause he was molested.â€
â€œI know that â€™cause I did it.â€
[LAUGHTER]
â€œProbably a bad idea.â€
I think half of these shooter kids are incel, virgin weirdos.
They need to get laid, but itâ€™s harder to get laid than it is to buy a gun.
You can buy a gun at Walmart. You donâ€™t wanna fuck anybody at Walmart.
Thatâ€™s why every gun shop should double as a whorehouse.
Slow these kids down a little bit, you know?
Some angry kid comes in, â€œI need an AR-15.â€
Weâ€™re like, â€œWhoa, whoa. How about a Brazilian 18?â€
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]
Yeah!
[CHEERING]
Yeah. Then some kid has sex with her, goes back to school, heâ€™s like, â€œWhat the fuck was I so angry about?â€
â€œHoly hell. Life is good!â€
Someoneâ€™s like, â€œAre you smoking?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, Iâ€™m paying a hooker.â€
[LAUGHTER]
All right, thanks a lot. Iâ€™m Kevin Hart. You guys are great.
Have a good night. Comedy! Thank you.
Queef it up!
Praise Allah!
Iâ€™m gay!
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

[clacking]
[soft bamboo flute notes play]
[â€œSledgehammerâ€ by Peter Gabriel plays]
[roar of cheering audience]
â™ª Hey, hey, you â™ª â™ª Tell me, how have you been? â™ª
[cheering grows louder]
â™ª I wanna be â™ª â™ª Your sledgehammer â™ª â™ª Why donâ€™t you call my name? â™ª
Thank you very much! Thank you, everybody!
[cheering swells]
Thank you.
Please, take a seat.
[audience quiets]
Thank you so much. Thanks for coming out. Yeah, man. Weâ€™re here.
[scattered cheers]
Yeah. [cheering grows louder]
[cheering fades]
Well, let me ask you guys something, man. Are they gonna keep taking our Confederate statues down or what?
[laughter]
[man] Yeah!
[laughter]
Just taking the temperature of the room.
I donâ€™t know whoâ€™s here, you know?
[laughter]
[groans disgustedly]
â€œThatâ€™s a weird one to start.â€ All right.
[laughter]
Yeah, Iâ€™ve been on this, uh, phenomenal tour, and Iâ€™ve, uh, Iâ€™ve met people I never thought I would meet in my life. Recently I met a supermodel, which is wild becauseâ€¦ Well, I donâ€™t think she wanted to meet me. I should be clear. I was in aâ€¦ a fancy hotel in Toronto, and somebody that worked there, they go to her, â€œHey, heâ€™s a comedian.â€ And she was like, â€œOkay.â€ [laughter] And then they go, â€œSheâ€™s a supermodel.â€ I was like, â€œI can see.â€
[laughter]
And what struck me is that they are so much better-looking than you think theyâ€™re gonna be. Like, you see in a magazine or on your phone, and youâ€™re like, â€œSheâ€™s pretty.â€ But in person, youâ€™re like, â€œWhat the fuck is happening right now?â€ [laughter] And then you realize that itâ€™s a genetic freak.
[crowd chuckles]
It is. If you are a supermodel, you are a freak. You are no different than a seven-foot-tall man.
[laughter]
I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever met a seven-footer. I have. It is unsettling. All right? You basicallyâ€¦ you go, like, â€œAm I a child? Whatâ€¦ What is happening?â€ This woman was so unbelievably good-looking. Like, five seconds into our conversation, I stopped speaking and listening. All right? [laughter] I was looking at her like she was at the zoo. I was likeâ€¦ [laughter] I was like, â€œLet me see your ears.â€ Was looking for flaws. [laughter] She was absolutely perfect. And then my next thought was, â€œWhy canâ€™t my wife just drown?â€
You know?
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
She knows. I told her. She knows.
[laughter]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou know I can swim, right?â€
â€œI know. Doesnâ€™t matter if you can swim. It matters if a jury believes you can.â€
Soâ€¦
[laughter]
[snorts] Iâ€™ve, uhâ€¦ Iâ€™ve been to unbelievable places because of this job. Itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s really crazy. Iâ€™veâ€¦ Iâ€™ve seen amazing places. Been to Rome. Hong Kong. Machu Picchu. All because of this job. And then, thereâ€™s other days. [crowd chuckling] Like, I had to go to Topeka, Kansas to do a show. [laughter] We went because they bought tickets, but we got the fuck out right away. [laughter] There was something cool that happened there, which is that my show there was protested by the Westboro Baptist Church. Uhâ€¦
[mumbles]
[cheers and applause]
Donâ€™t know if you know them. Sometimes theyâ€™re in the news. [crowd chuckles] If youâ€™re like, â€œOh, really? Thereâ€™s a church in the news? But why?â€ [laughter] Well, sometimes they also protest dead soldiersâ€™ funerals, cool shit like that. Andâ€¦ I was backstage, and my tour manager came in the room, he goes, â€œWestboro Baptist Church is here.â€ I was like, â€œTo see the show? Really?â€ [laughter] And he was like, â€œNo.â€ Said, â€œTheyâ€™re protesting.â€ And they were out front with their dumb fuckinâ€™ signs.
[crowd chuckling]
Their homemade signs â€™cause theyâ€™re poor.
Uhâ€¦
[laughter] They had signs made that said, â€œTom is a sinner.â€ And I was like, â€œYes.â€
[crowd cheering]
[mumbles] Yeah. True.
[cheers fade]
[scattered applause]
Then they had, like, real hateful signs too that said, uh, like, â€œGod hates gays.â€ But didnâ€™t say â€œgay.â€ [laughter] It was another word. [laughter continues] [laughter swells] Your dad says it when the Cardinals lose. You know, like, uhâ€¦
[laughter, cheering]
[scattered applause]
All right, your uncle. Somebody says it. Uhâ€¦ [laughter] I took offense. Not so much to the word as the implication. That God hates gays. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s true. I think God has a people problem. There are too many people, and that is not gay peopleâ€™s fault.
[laughter]
[cheers, applause]
Because they butt fuck. I have to spell everything out? [laughter] Jesus. You can nut as hard as you want in somebodyâ€™s ass over and over and over, and something will come out, but itâ€™s not a baby. Uhâ€¦
[audience member whistles]
[cheering] I meanâ€¦
[cheering continues]
Still worth taking a picture of, I would argue. [laughter] Maybe give it a name. Itâ€™s not gonna live long. Uhâ€¦ [hushed laughter] [laughter swells] Iâ€™m not gay, butâ€¦ I am not above checking out a dude. Iâ€™m serious. Like, if Iâ€™m at the beach and thereâ€™s some super fucking, likeâ€¦ just yoked dude there, Iâ€™ll be like, â€œHey.â€ â€œNice.â€ [laughter] â€œVery nice.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s your protein intake? What do you do?â€ â€œCardio and lift? Of course.â€ Then a hot chickâ€™ll walk by. â€œGet outta here. What are you doing?â€ [laughter] I think the gayest I ever wasâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦was in February. [laughter] Thatâ€™s when I did my shows in Los Angeles and Brad Pitt came to my show.
[cheers and applause]
Lookâ€¦ I do not know what year he was born or how many infants he consumes in a week, but that manâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦is stunning. All right? He came into my dressing room. I couldnâ€™t make eye contact. Do you understand? I was like, â€œHey, whatâ€™s up, man? How you doing?â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œLook at me.â€ I was like, â€œNo.â€ [laughter continues] He goes, â€œCome on.â€ I said, â€œShut up.â€ [laughter]
[laughter continues]
He goes, â€œWanna give me a kiss?â€ I was like, â€œYeah.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
He goes, â€œDo it.â€ I wentâ€¦ Like that, I kissed him.
[laughter]
What?
[crowd cheering]
[audience member whistles]
It wasnâ€™t gay.
[laughter]
We took a bath later. That was gay. Butâ€¦
[laughter] â€¦we talked about sports, so it balanced out, you know? I think youâ€™re lucky if, in this life, you have, like, one real friend. You know? Like a true friend. I think I have four.
Brad Pittâ€¦
[laughter] Umâ€¦ I call him Pitt Stop â€™cause weâ€™re close. Uhâ€¦ [laughter] And three other guys. People you know intimately. Like, you know each otherâ€™s secrets and stuff. Like, one of my friends, I know that he hides that he smokes weed from his wife. His name is Casey.
Umâ€¦
[laughter] One of my friends hides that he eats McDonaldâ€™s from his wife because heâ€™s fat, and his name is Charlie. [laughter] [laughs devilishly] I guess they know now, but, you knowâ€¦ Itâ€™s wild when you find out something new after knowing people that long. Iâ€™ve known these guys, like, 25, 30 years. And I found out last week, so 25 years into these friendships, that Iâ€™m the only one who eats ass. In that entire group. Isnâ€™t thatâ€¦ crazy to you? Likeâ€¦
[cheers and applause]
I guess Iâ€™m friends with a bunch of third-graders. I donâ€™t know. Likeâ€¦ [laughter] One of the guys is newly in love too. Justin. Newly in love. Usually newly in love people are really on board, you know? Because everythingâ€™s rainbows and butterflies. Like, every day Justinâ€™s likeâ€¦ [giggles gleefully] [laughter] [softly] â€œIâ€™m in love.â€ I go, â€œThatâ€™s great. Did you eat her ass?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo.â€ I said, â€œSo you donâ€™t like her.â€ [laughter] And he was like, â€œNo, I do.â€ And I said, â€œNo, you donâ€™t.â€ [laughter] â€œIf you did, youâ€™d give her the sweetest kiss of all.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
And he goes, â€œThatâ€™s where she shits.â€
[laughter]
I was like, â€œYeah, donâ€™t do it then.â€
[laughter] Wait a while, you know? Put her in a bath or something. Thatâ€™s what I did with Brad. Nowâ€¦ [laughter]
[cheers and applause]
[applause fades]
He goes, â€œYouâ€™re gross.â€ I was like, â€œWhatever.â€ And he said, â€œThatâ€™s what a dog does.â€ I said, â€œExcuse me?â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œA dog licks its own ass.â€ I said, â€œFirst of all, if I could lick my own ass, I wouldnâ€™t be on tour, all right?â€ [laughter] I would do it until a doctor told me to stop. [laughter] He would have to sit me down and be like, â€œYouâ€™re not gonna have an ass soon if you donâ€™t knock this off.â€ [laughter] Iâ€™d be like, â€œBut it feels good.â€ [laughter] And heâ€™d go, â€œI donâ€™t trust you.â€ â€œGonna put a cone around your neck.â€ Iâ€™d be likeâ€¦ â€œI can take it off with my paws.â€ Okayâ€¦
[laughter fades, swells]
Sorry, that was very stupid. Iâ€™m sorry. Nowâ€¦ I wish my dad was still here, you know? He died a few months ago. And I understand itâ€™s part of life. It happens to everybody. And, uh, you know, Iâ€¦ I justâ€¦ I had never visited somebody sick in the hospital. That was a new experience. Itâ€™s strange. If youâ€™ve never done it, you get to the hospital and then somebody that works there goes, â€œAre you here to seeâ€¦â€ And you go, â€œYeah.â€ They go, â€œTheyâ€™re gonna die soon.â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œI thought so too. Thatâ€™s why I came.â€ [laughter] And then they go, â€œYou can go in there and watch that now.â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œThanks.â€ [scattered laughter] Personally, I feel like watching somebody die that youâ€™re not trying to killâ€¦
is weird, you know?
[laughter] Like, itâ€™s different if you have somebody and youâ€™re likeâ€¦ [laughter] And they go, â€œIâ€™m dying.â€ Like, â€œI know. I want you dead. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m doing this.â€ Probably feels good. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m assuming itâ€™s a euphoric feeling that you chase forever and ever. Butâ€¦ Ask Garth Brooks. Heâ€™ll tell you all about it. Soâ€¦
[loud cheering, applause]
Come on. Where are the bodies, G? [cheering continues] Please.
[cheering continues, fades]
Connect the dots. Nowâ€¦
[laughter] I will tell you this. I did have a great conversation with my father. And I hope if youâ€™re ever in that situation, you get it too. We had this great talk. And then he just drops this on me. He goes, â€œYou know what Iâ€™ve never told you?â€ And I was like, â€œNo. What?â€ And I was really hoping he was gonna say, you know, â€œThereâ€™s a treasure buried in the backyard.â€ [laughter] â€œItâ€™s for you.â€ I go, â€œWhat have you never told me?â€ He goes, â€œI like a full bush on a lady.â€ And I was like, â€œWhat? What?â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
He goes, â€œYour mother keeps trimming hers.â€
I go, â€œHey, what the fuck, man?â€
[laughter] I go, â€œWhy are you telling me this?â€
And he goes, â€œWho am I supposed to tell?â€
[laughter] I go, â€œThe Lord. Youâ€™re about to meet him.â€ And that was it. Then he said the â€œNâ€ word and then he died. [mumbles]
[laughter]
[scattered cheers and applause] It was his last wish. All right? Yeah. Make-A-Wish was pissed. [laughter] They were like, â€œWe donâ€™t do that.â€ I was like, â€œWell, maybe you should.â€ If it was between saying that or meeting Tom Brady, Iâ€™d be like, â€œFuck Tom Brady. I wanna say it.â€
[laughter]
[scattered cheers and applause]
[loud cheering]
What really sucks about losing a parent is when you have kids. â€˜Cause you want your parents to hang out with your kids, you know? Like, I haveâ€¦ I have two boys. Theyâ€™re six and three. And they are boys. Like, real â€œhe/himâ€ s, if you know what Iâ€™m saying. Uhâ€¦ [laughter] Donâ€™t worry, we asked them. All right? [mumbles] They were likeâ€¦ [gruff] â€œDefinitely.â€ Weâ€™re like, â€œOh, okay.â€ â€œItâ€™s up to you.â€ Nowâ€¦ [hushed laughter]
[laughter slowly builds]
[scattered applause] [loud cheering and applause] Luckily, I have a cousin that lives near me and he has two girls the same age. Six and three. So I get this wildly different experience up close and in person all the time. And these girls come over to my house. My God. What did I do wrong where I didnâ€™t get girls? These girlsâ€¦ they show up, and theyâ€™re like, [softly] â€œHello, Uncle Tommy.â€ [laughter] I go, â€œHello to you.â€ [laughter] They go, â€œWhere should we sit?â€ I go, â€œTry one of the chairs.â€ [laughter] And they go, â€œWe would like to color.â€ I go, â€œPlease.â€ [laughter] And then they sit down and they fucking color.
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
An hour later, I can go into that room and theyâ€™re likeâ€¦ [humming pleasantly] [laughter] I go, â€œThatâ€™s nice.â€ â€œWhere are my boys?â€ [laughter] â€œAre they in the house?â€ â€œAre they on the house?â€ [laughter] â€œAre theyâ€¦ Oh, theyâ€™re on the street. Fantastic.â€ I go out, like, â€œWhat the hell are you guys doing?â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œWe broke all the crayonsâ€¦â€ [laughter] â€œâ€¦and we put â€™em in the mailbox.â€ And I goâ€¦
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
â€œThank you. Thanks for doing that.â€
[cheers and applause]
[audience member whistles]
My six-year-old, he goes, â€œWhat would you do if a bad guy took your stuff?â€ [crowd chuckles] â€œWould ask him to give it back. I donâ€™t know.â€ He goes, â€œI would get a sword.â€ [laughter] â€œI would cut him into pieces.â€ [laughter continues] â€œAnd Iâ€™d put the pieces in the mailbox.â€ Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [laughter] â€œWhat are you doing with the mailbox, Dahmer?â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œYou know Grandpa liked a full bush?â€ I go, â€œHeyâ€¦â€ [uproarious laughter] â€œDid he call you? How do you know?â€
[audience member whistles]
[cheering]
[man shouts indistinctly]
My kids call me Tom. [laughter] So unnerving. Every day, the older oneâ€™s likeâ€¦ [gravelly] â€œHow you doing, Tom?â€ I go, â€œHey, Iâ€™m not your fuckinâ€™ stepdad, all right?â€
[laughter]
[scattered cheering] â€œI wish I was. Itâ€™d be a lot easier. But Iâ€™m not.â€
[cheering]
[scattered applause]
I go, â€œCall me Dad.â€ He goes, â€œI like Tom.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right.â€ â€œWhat is up with your voice? You smoke cigarettes? Why do you talk like that?â€ The kid sounds like he fixes Harleys all day, butâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦heâ€™s really just obsessed with the decades-old video game, Pac-Man. And he has Pac-Man questions morning, noon, and night. He woke me up at three in the morning. Letâ€™s be clear. He doesnâ€™t know how to wake somebody up. All right? He stood an inch from my faceâ€¦ [laughter] The most menacing way somebody can wake you up. He just goes, â€œHey, Tom!â€ I was like, â€œHoly shit!â€ [laughter] â€œWhat?!â€
[laughter continues]
Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat would happenâ€¦ if Pac-Man needed a house?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat theâ€¦ What?!â€ [laughter] He thinks I didnâ€™t understand the question. [laughter] So he slows it down. For me. [laughter] He goesâ€¦ [enunciated dramatically] â€œWhat would hap-penâ€¦ ifâ€¦â€ I go, â€œHeâ€™d call a realtor.â€ Iâ€™m having a heart attack, all right? [laughter] â€œPac-Man would get a loan and buy a house.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOkay, Iâ€™m going to bed.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right. Iâ€™ll be up for three days. Thanks.â€ [laughter] [man whoops] At the same time, I have a monitor on the nightstand for the little guy. This dude stands up in bed and he goes, â€œWhat was that?â€ [laughter] So now I drag my ass into his room. Heâ€™s standing there with his gut out. You know theyâ€™re likeâ€¦
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
Iâ€™m like, â€œDo you own a Chevron? Why do you stand like that, dude?â€ [laughter] I go, â€œWhat?â€ He goes, â€œWhat was that?â€ I go, â€œWhat was what?â€ He goes, â€œThat.â€ I go, â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ He goes, â€œWhat was that?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know what youâ€™re asking.â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œWas that the choo-choo?â€ I said, â€œWhat?â€ He goesâ€¦ [exasperatedly] â€œWas it a choo-choo?â€ [crowd chuckling]
He said it like, â€œAre you stupid enoughâ€¦â€
[laughter] â€œâ€¦to turn our trains on without the conductor at the helm?â€ I go, â€œNo.â€ He goes, â€œSo, what was it?â€ I go, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ I said, â€œMaybe it was a choo-choo.â€ He goes, â€œYeah. Donâ€™t do that.â€
I was like, â€œOh.â€
[laughter] â€œAll right, al-Qaeda boss, go back in your cave.â€ [laughter fades to soft murmuring] Heâ€™s one of those kids that only laughs at real anger. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever met one of those peaches, butâ€¦ See, most two and three-year-olds, they laugh at manufactured anger. Performative anger. You can go up to a kid that age and just go, â€œRarrr. And theyâ€™re likeâ€¦â€ [giggles joyfully] And this kidâ€™s like, â€œMm-mmm.â€ â€œI wanna see your blood pressure spike, man.â€ [laughter] The hardest Iâ€™ve ever seen him laugh, itâ€™s not even close, is when he flushed my car keys down the toilet. [audience exclaims] It was my fault, I guess. I didnâ€™t hang them up. I put them on the coffee table that I also bought. Andâ€¦ [laughter] I was laying on the couch. You know, it was a long day. I see his little ass come in the room, see the keys, and heâ€™s likeâ€¦ [laughter] And I go, â€œNo. Donâ€™t.â€ And he picks them up and he goes, â€œChase me.â€ [laughter] â€œDown the hall.â€ [laughter] I go, â€œOkay.â€ I give him a head start. Heâ€™s three. [laughter continues] When I stand up, I see him dip into the bathroom. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œNo.â€ [laughter] And when I get thereâ€¦ [imitates toilet flushing] And I lose my shit. [laughter] I donâ€™t yell at him. Iâ€™m just yelling at my life.
You know?
[laughter] Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck!â€ [laughter continues] â€œNo!â€ â€œFuck!â€ And when I turn, heâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s what Iâ€™m talking about.â€
[loud cheering, applause] [audience member whistles]
â€œYouâ€™re a very funny guy.â€
[laughter] Fuckinâ€™ kicked him in the chest.
[laughter]
[chuckles softly] God, those little shits. I took a shower with the, uh, six-year-old. Heâ€™s six, heâ€™s not 16.
Umâ€¦
[laughter] If youâ€™ve never showered with a six-year-old, let me give you some advice: make sure itâ€™s yours.
Otherwiseâ€¦
[laughter] Itâ€™s strange if youâ€™re like, â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€ [laughter] Heâ€™s my son. And I wanted to, you knowâ€¦ I was trying to be like a fun dad. Iâ€¦ I offered him the showerhead. I thought it was a fun, in-the-moment thing. I go, â€œDo you wanna hold the showerhead?â€ And he was like, â€œYeah.â€ [laughter] I give it to him. He just starts cleaning the shower. Heâ€™s likeâ€¦ [laughter] So, you know, after a minute, Iâ€™m like, â€œCan you wet me?â€ [laughter] And he goes, â€œTom, relax. All right?â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause, cheering]
Then he looks up at me. He goesâ€¦ [gravelly] â€œYou have a big penis.â€ [laughter] â€œAnd I have a small one.â€ [laughter] I go, â€œWell, thatâ€™s â€™cause mineâ€™s hard, buddy.â€ [uproarious laughter]
[cheers and applause] â€œWe can make yours hard too. Just gotta go likeâ€¦â€ [audience exclaims, laughs] [hushed murmurs, chatter]
[disappointedly] â€œNo.â€
[laughter] [laughingly] I did not jerk off my son. [laughter] I just always wanted to say that. Uhâ€¦ [laughter] [sputters, laughs] [laughter] The truth isâ€¦ The truth is, he really did say, â€œYou have a big penis. And I have a small one.â€ And what I really said, immediately, and I mean in a split second of him saying that, I wentâ€¦ [gutturally] â€œNo!â€ [laughter] And if youâ€™re like, â€œWhy did you shout, â€˜Noâ€™?â€ I think because in that split second I thought, â€œI donâ€™t want this to be some shit you start saying when weâ€™re out.â€ [laughter] I donâ€™t wanna be in a store where heâ€™s like, â€œDo you have a big penis?â€ Iâ€™ll be likeâ€¦ â€œYeah.â€ [laughter] â€œYou know how it is.â€ Guyâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know how it is.â€ â€œWhat the fuck was that all about?â€ [crowd chuckling] The worst part is that I scared him. When I shouted. Thatâ€™s a terrible feeling. You see fear register on your kidâ€™s face because of your overreaction. And I wanted to say the right thing. Or whatever the right thing is to say in that situation. Which I suppose wouldâ€™ve been something like, â€œYou didnâ€™t do anything wrong. You made an observation.â€ â€œI shouldnâ€™t have shouted. Iâ€™m sorry. Do you need therapy?â€
â€œI love you, man.â€ You knowâ€¦
[laughter] But it was all happening so quickly that I didnâ€™t know what to say. So the fuckinâ€™ best I could come up with? I went, â€œNo!â€ â€œJustâ€¦ shh.â€ [laughter] Now heâ€™s totally confused. [crowd chuckling] He goesâ€¦ [whispers] â€œYou have a big penis.â€ [laughter] â€œI have a small one.â€ [laughter continues] I go, â€œWell, donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ tell anybody.â€ He goes, â€œDid Grandpa have a big penis?â€ I go, â€œI donâ€™t remember. Havenâ€™t seen it in a long time.â€ [laughter] â€œLetâ€™s go ask Grandma.â€ [laughter continues] And we did. [scattered cheers] And he didnâ€™t. [laughter]
[scattered applause]
[loud cheering]
[audience member whistles]
For the record,
neither do I.
[laughter] I wanna make that perfectly clear to everybody here. I do not have a big penis. Butâ€¦ next to a six-year-oldâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦I got a fuckinâ€™ sledgehammer on me. Pretty proud of it.
[cheering]
[whistling] [snorts, splutters] [two thudding slaps] [chokes] You almost broke the fuckinâ€™ stage, dude. [laughter] [sighs] The truth is this. Iâ€™m just, uhâ€¦ Iâ€™m happy to be doing stand-up again and actually standing. Because not long ago, I had a sports-related injury. I donâ€™t know if you know this or not. Umâ€¦ [crowd cheering] Wellâ€¦ If you donâ€™t know, I will try to say this with a straight face. Uhâ€¦ I, Tom, the guy you see standing up here, I was severely injured whilst participating in a slam-dunk contest.
[scattered cheers and applause]
[loud cheering]
Umâ€¦ On a slightly-lowered rim. Nowâ€¦ It was wild. If you donâ€™t know, I tore my patellar tendonâ€¦ [exhales swiftly] â€¦right there. Which, you know, whatever. [chuckles] [laughter] Happened to Klay Thompson, happened to me. It happens to us. Butâ€¦ [laughter] Iâ€™m not Klay Thompson, so I also broke this arm. Andâ€¦ Itâ€™s all captured on video that I find very not funny, but a lot of people enjoy it.
[scattered applause]
I have to tell people, â€œI didnâ€™t laugh a lot that night.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œReally?â€ Yeah. There is one exchange that I do like to share, and it is this. Immediately after I was hurt, I was in the emergency room. And I was badly hurt. I had a shattered arm, a leg that didnâ€™t function. And they were prepping me for the operating room. And at that time, a trauma surgeon came into that room and he looked at my x-rays and he goes, â€œCar accident?â€ [laughter] And I got to lay there and goâ€¦ [quietly] â€œDunk contest.â€ [laughter]
[cheers and applause]
And he goes, â€œWhat was that? What did you just say?â€ And I go, â€œSlam motherfuckinâ€™ dunk contest.â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œDid a car hit you while you were dunking?â€ [laughter] I said, â€œWhy donâ€™t you do your fuckinâ€™ job, all right?â€ Some people donâ€™t know this, I was in the hospital for three weeks. Thatâ€™s a long time. I donâ€™t think I wouldâ€™ve made it through if it werenâ€™t for my dear, dear friend,
Dilaudid. Umâ€¦
[laughter] [scattered cheers] Yeah. I did not realize that I have been fucking around with weed all these yearsâ€¦ [scattered cheering] â€¦when narcotics is where itâ€™s at. All right?
[cheering]
[scattered applause]
That shit is electric. Andâ€¦ if anybody ever offers you an oxy, say, â€œHit me two times.â€ Becauseâ€¦ theyâ€™re amazing and nothing badâ€™ll happen to you. [laughter] Nah, your life will fall apart, but itâ€™ll feel good while itâ€™s happening. The only downside really is that youâ€™ll never shitâ€¦ again.
Uhâ€¦
[laughter] I took my first shit eight days after I started eating those. I was scared. I called in the doctor. I was like, â€œI have an arm that doesnâ€™t work, a leg that doesnâ€™t work.â€ â€œHow do I lean? How do I wipe myself?â€ He goes, â€œDonâ€™t worry about it.â€ â€œOne of the nurses will do it.â€ And I was like, â€œOkay.â€ [laughter] And then a fuckinâ€™ male nurse came in the room. [laughter] Theyâ€™re allowed to have the job too. Andâ€¦ [crowd chuckling] This dude stood at the door and threw a pack of wipes. [laughter] I go, â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ He said, â€œThe doctor said you need to clean yourself.â€ And I wentâ€¦ [chuckles devilishly] [uproarious laughter] â€œYouâ€™re gonna do it.â€ And I saw a grown professional nurse
just go, â€œAh, fuck.â€ Likeâ€¦
[laughter] He quit. I saw him quit his job. Isnâ€™t that crazy? Nowâ€¦ Five days later, I had my second movement, and they sent in an old-lady nurse, which is fine. But she talked the whole time. Do you know how terribleâ€¦? Youâ€™re vulnerable. Likeâ€¦ [whimpers] Sheâ€™s back there, like, â€œHow we gonna clean up all this stool?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know. Shut up.â€
[laughter] And she goes, â€œMy, my, my.â€ â€œYou have so much hair back here.â€ And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œYeah, I do it for my dad.â€
You know, likeâ€¦
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
What? I meanâ€¦ I like to picture him up in heaven, looking down. â€œLook at that hair on my son. Isnâ€™t that nice?â€ Godâ€™s with him. â€œThat is nice.â€ [laughter] I picture my dad naked. You know? [laughs] Iâ€¦ [laughter] I picture everybody in heaven nakâ€¦ I donâ€™t think youâ€™re in heaven, â€œWhat shirt should I wear today?â€ I think people are naked. I think Godâ€™s naked. I think after a while it makes sense that my father would notice that God has a fuckinâ€™ piece on him. You know? Itâ€™s God. I think itâ€™s enormous. And glorious. I think itâ€™s blue.
And I thinkâ€¦
[laughter] â€¦it has a golden hue around it. I think after a while, my dad would go, â€œCan I touch that?â€ [laughter] And Godâ€™s like, â€œOf course.â€ â€œYou are one of my children.â€ [chuckles] [laughter] [laughter swells] Then he goes, â€œThanks. That was neat.â€ [laughter] And then God says, â€œDo you want to see it snow?â€ [imitates sexual moaning] [laughter] Thatâ€™s what snow is. You didnâ€™t know that? Snowing. Good. I hope I ruined snow for you. Nowâ€¦ [laughter] It took me six months of pretty intense rehab, PT and OT. Shout-out to all the PTs and OTs in the world working with people.
Fantastic.
[applause]
Well, they worked with me so that I could move around again normally and naturally. And then this always gets me, you guys. Seven months to the day, to the day, after I was injured, I was at home. I was asleep. It was two oâ€™clock in the morning. And I heard my wife scream, but, like, a real scream. You know, likeâ€¦ [muted panicked screaming] So I took a pillow, I turned, and I covered this ear. Right? [laughter] â€œI am trying to sleep.â€ And then she starts calling me out by name. Sheâ€™s like, â€œTom?â€ â€œTom?â€ And I go, â€œGoddammit.â€
[laughter]
â€œThis sounds real.â€ So I got up, I made myself something to eat. [laughter] Poured a drink. And I was like, â€œAll right.â€ â€œLetâ€™s go find her.â€ [laughter] Now, itâ€™s 2:00 a.m. Iâ€¦ I canâ€™t see anything. Iâ€™m just following her cries for help. And I finally find her sitting at the bottom of the stairs. And I go, â€œWhat are you doing?â€ She goes, â€œI think I sprained my ankle.â€ [laughter] I turn the light on, and I see that the bone that should be like thisâ€¦
[clicks tongue] â€¦is like that.
[audience groans] And I go, â€œThatâ€¦ [laughingly] â€¦is not a sprain.â€ [laughter] â€œIâ€™m sure of it.â€ [laughter] And she goes, â€œWhat should I do?â€ I said, â€œYou should do nothing.â€ â€œI will call 911.â€ [laughter] I have to confess I was very, very excited to call 911. [laughter] Have you ever been excited to call? Like, â€œFinally, a good one.â€ You know? Likeâ€¦ â€œThis is why we play the game.â€ I call. The operator goes, â€œ911.â€ And Iâ€™m so amped up, I go, â€œGet fuckinâ€™ ready.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause] Heâ€™s like, â€œOkay.â€ [laughter continues] He goes, â€œYou need police, fire, or paramedic?â€ I go, â€œParamedic!â€ â€œBut send â€™em all!â€ And he was like, â€œWhat happened?â€ And I was like, â€œOoh.â€ [laughter] And I realize that while what Iâ€™m about to say is true, it soundsâ€¦
[high-pitched] â€¦suspicious.
[laughter] But I gotta say it. So Iâ€™m like, â€œMy wife fell down the stairs.â€ [loud laughter]
[cheers and applause]
[cheers fading]
The operator goes, â€œUh-huh.â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œHowâ€™d that happen?â€ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ know.â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œWas she alone?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œDo I need to talk to a lawyer?â€ [laughter] Four paramedics show up. I open the door. They go, â€œWhat happened?â€ I go, â€œYou know the deal.â€ [laughter] â€œMy wife fell down the stairs.â€ And they go, â€œHowâ€™d it happen?â€ I go, â€œI do not know.â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œWas she alone?â€ I go, â€œTalk to my lawyer. Heâ€™s on the phone right now.â€ [crowd chuckling] Then they start tending to her. Like, they put her leg in a brace. You know? Start giving her an IV. I lean over to her and I have a private conversation as you sometimes do. I go, â€œHey, I wanna tell you something.â€ â€œI donâ€™t like the way Iâ€™m being spoken to here.â€ [laughter] â€œI feel like everybodyâ€™s implying I had something to do with this.â€ â€œAnd I donâ€™t like it.â€ And then I walked away. And a few moments later, she decided to make an announcement. [crowd chuckles] Unprompted. She goes, â€œGuys?â€ And they all turn. And she goes, â€œHe would never hurt me.â€
And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
[uproarious laughter]
[scattered applause]
â€œWhat are you doing?â€ [scattered cheers] She goes, â€œWeâ€™ve been together a long time.â€ â€œAnd if you think he did this, he didnâ€™t.â€ I go, â€œShut the fuck up.â€ [laughter] â€œOr I will kill you.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
Then we get to the hospital. Doctorâ€™s like, â€œWhat happened?â€ I go, â€œI punched her in the mouth and she fell down the stairs.â€ [laughter]
And he goes, â€œI get it, man. I get it.â€
[laughter] â€œSheâ€™s super chatty.â€ I go, â€œI know.â€ [laughter continues] â€œYou should see her at home.â€ No, sheâ€™s doing better now. She learned. She gets it, you know.
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
â€œSandwich at 6:00.â€ All right. Soâ€¦
[laughs softly]
[crowd chuckling] She came to a show and saw me tell that story, and she was like, â€œCan you imagine if you had hit me?â€ And I was like, â€œUhâ€¦ yeah.â€ [laughter] Donâ€™t feel bad for her, okay? Iâ€™m serious. I just did her a huge solid. She asked me to do this and I did it. She asked me to get a vasectomy and I did it.
So I got snipped. Yeah.
[women cheering] See? The women always cheer and thereâ€™s always one guy that boos. [laughter] Like he wanted my full load all up inside of him. [laughter] Listen, if youâ€™re a guy and youâ€™re thinking about doing it, do it. Itâ€™s a routine procedure. You will be nervous the morning of. Itâ€™s your balls.
[crowd chuckling]
You lay on a table. Itâ€™s very cold.
Itâ€™s, like, 400 below zero. Andâ€¦
[laughter] They pull up your dress very dramatically. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhatâ€™s going on down here?â€ [laughter] Your dick just stares at you, like, â€œHow could you?â€ You know? [laughter] But itâ€™s over in 15 minutes, which I think is remarkable. And then you go back a week later for the follow-up. And the follow-up is just a urologist checking you out. Goes, â€œAll right, drop your shorts.â€ Like, â€œAll rightâ€¦â€ [inquisitive humming] [laughter]
[moaning softly]
[laughter] He goes, â€œYeah, it tastes the same.â€ You know? [laughter] [audience murmuring, chuckling] He says, â€œIâ€™m gonna give you your homework.â€ Those are his words. â€œIâ€™m gonna give you your homework.â€ I go, â€œWhatâ€™s my homework?â€ He goes, â€œGo home, ejaculate 20 times.â€ â€œBring in your 21st sample in this cup, and weâ€™ll test it and let you know if youâ€™re clear.â€ I was like, â€œThat ainâ€™t shit.â€ You know?
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
I do my homework all the time, baby. Soâ€¦
[laughter]
[cheering] He goes to leave, but he stops at the door. He goes, â€œOh! I almost forgot to tell you.â€ â€œTake your time.â€ And I said, â€œI was gonna.â€ [laughter] And then he says, â€œSometimes I forget to tell people.â€ Which tells me that some people have returned rather quickly. [laughter] With their assignment. So I immediately ask him. I go, â€œWhatâ€™s the fastest anyoneâ€™s done 20 ejaculations?â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œ48 hours.â€
And I was likeâ€¦
[audience groans] â€œThat motherfucker can keep that record. I donâ€™t want anything to do with that.â€ [laughter]
â€œThatâ€™s the champ champ right there.â€
[laughter] I went home and took another week off. I was black and blue. I was sore. Like, â€œAll right.â€ But after the week, itâ€™s time to get going. I started slowly, you know. I was likeâ€¦ [laughter] â€œWake up.â€ Didnâ€™t feel the same. It was strange. Different. You know? I could feel the system turning on. You know what it reminded me of? You know when you run the heat for the first time in the winter? And youâ€™re like, â€œThis smells weird, man.â€ Likeâ€¦ [laughter] I could feel it building up. And I could not get this one intrusive thought out of my head, which was, â€œItâ€™s just gonna be blood that comes out.â€ [audience groans]
I didnâ€™t want it to be.
[laughter] I just kept thinking it. So now Iâ€™m jerking off all scared. Likeâ€¦ [exaggerated whimpering]
[sorrowfully] â€œItâ€™s gonna be blood!â€
[laughter] But I pushed through. I kept going. Andâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦when it finally did go, it wasnâ€™t blood. And in relief, I laughed. [crowd chuckles] So my first jack back was me goingâ€¦
[laughs maniacally]
[laughter] [applause]
Yeah. Wellâ€¦
[crowd cheering]
[cheers and applause continuing]
Instagram took it down, but itâ€™s on my OnlyFans
if you wanna see it.
[laughter] Six bucks a month. Nowâ€¦ The only thing, uh, that could deal with that specific type of pain when I had the vasectomy was eating edibles. You know? I had to eat edibles every day for that achy, weird pain. Yeah. I always feel like I have to confess to people immediately when I tell them, like, that I like edibles, and that is because I am a lightweight and I like mild edibles.
Some people wanna eat ediblesâ€¦
[applause]
You know, yeah. Andâ€¦ Some people wanna peek into the third dimension casually every day. [cheering] Thatâ€™s not me. All right? I like five and ten milligrams,
and peopleâ€¦
[cheering]
Sure.
[applause]
People mock me and they call me â€œ10 Milligram Tomâ€
and this bullshit.
[laughter] Yell it to me on the street. Like, â€œAre you eating your baby edibles?â€ And I go, â€œYes. Because I like to be able to speak.â€
â€œIs that crazy to you?â€
[scattered cheers] â€œYou donâ€™t know people that like a couple beers?â€ Is it always, â€œI like to drink 36.â€ â€œOkay. Good for you, Bert.â€
â€œHave a great night.â€ Soâ€¦
[raucous cheering]
[cheering fades]
[guffaws mockingly] [laughter]
[scattered cheers and applause]
[mockingly] â€œIâ€™m the mechanic!â€ Or whatever. [laughter] [crowd cheering] Yeah. [cheering continues] Bert. [audience member whistles] Wellâ€¦ â€œWe forgot how the story goes. Tell it again.â€ Nowâ€¦
[laughter]
[chortles] Thatâ€™s my bestie. [laughter] Speaking of friends, you neverâ€¦ I wanna make this clear. If you drink, if you smoke, if you inject things into your eyeballs, you never have to worry about strangers. Never push the myth that a stranger might be culpable in getting you fucked up. People say it, like, â€œWhat if a stranger spikes my drink?â€ â€œWhat if a stranger hands me a joint and itâ€™s laced?â€ Guess what? Itâ€™ll never be a stranger. Itâ€™ll be one of your friends. Okay?
[laughter]
Your friends will fuck you the hardest. [laughter] I know this firsthand. I have a bunch of really cool friends. Umâ€¦ I found out on this tour that one of my friends was in the same city as I was in on the same night. Very rare in this line of work. I was in Miami. I find this out. I cancel our dinner plans. I drive across town. I walk into this club and I see my good friend. Some of you know him. Heâ€™s a comedian and podcaster. His name is Joey Diaz.
Nowâ€¦
[resounding cheers] [audience member whistles] [cheers fade] If youâ€™re here and donâ€™t know who that is, please allow me to describe him to you. [laughter] Joey is a very funny man. Heâ€™s aâ€¦ Heâ€™s a comedian. Heâ€™s 60 years old. Heâ€™s a Cuban immigrant. Uh, he weighs 295. Andâ€¦ he sort of looks like if somebody was making a person and then they left him under a heat lamp for like 15 minutes. [crowd groans, chuckling] As a side note, I feel like I should point out he was addicted to cocaine and heroin for 20 years. I think thatâ€™s relevant to the story. Nowâ€¦ [crowd chuckling] Joeyâ€™s very affectionate. I get to this place and he gives me a great big hug. And the first thing he says to me, he goes, â€œI got you something.â€ [crowd chuckles] I go, â€œYou got me something? What did you get me?â€ He goes, â€œI know you like your tens. Youâ€™re 10 Milli Tom.â€ [laughter] â€œI got you some tens.â€ And I go, â€œNo, you didnâ€™t.â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œI did.â€ I go, â€œNo, you didnâ€™t.â€ He goes, â€œWhy are you saying that?â€ â€œâ€˜Cause youâ€™re a liar and a bad person.â€
â€œYouâ€™re lying right now.â€
[laughter] He goes, â€œNo, Iâ€™m not.â€ I go, â€œSure you are.â€ And he has a jar, and he pours five gelcaps into his hand. And he goes, â€œThese are tens.â€ And I go, â€œBullshit.â€ [laughter] And then he goesâ€¦
[gulps]
[laughter] Eats all five. Like theyâ€™re Skittles. [laughter] So then I go, â€œHuh. Maybe they are tens.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause] I said, â€œI would like one.â€ I put it on my tongue. I take a sip of water. As it goes down, I look at him. He goes, â€œOh!â€ [laughter] I go, â€œHow much did I just take?â€ And he goes, â€œTen.â€
And he just walks out of the room.
[laughter] Iâ€™m watching him perform. You know, 30 minutes in, I have a buzz. When the showâ€™s over, I am outâ€¦ of my goddamn mind. [laughter] I am vibrating like a tuning fork. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [imitates pulsing vibration] [laughter] I canâ€™t open my eyes. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [laughter] I have to put my hand on a manâ€™s shoulder to guide me across the room.
Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
[laughter] I goâ€¦ [clenched] â€œJoey, we gotta get the fuck outta here.â€ And we do. Do you know where we go? To the airport. Yay. [laughter] Letâ€™s have a panic attack in a tube in the sky. Iâ€™m walking through Miami International Airport freaking people the fuck out. All right? You know why? I forget how to walk. I forget how to walk. I canâ€™t figure out the fuckinâ€™ body scanner thing. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [snickers] [laughter] [nervously] â€œCan you hear my heartbeat too?â€
[titters]
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
Iâ€™m sweating, but Iâ€™m cold. You know? Asking everyone for blankets, like, â€œDo you have a blanket?â€ â€œI want a blanket!â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œYouâ€™re on the toilet. Get the fuck outta here.â€ [laughter] I pass out in a meditative state. On this flight. I do. Then I just wake up scared. You ever wake up just terrified? Like, I sit up and Iâ€™m like, â€œAh!â€ [laughter] â€œWhy am I a bad person?â€ [laughter] And I do something Iâ€™ve never done. A flight attendant passes down the aisle, and as she passes, I grab her arm. Hard. Like Iâ€™m gonna put it on my dick. Like, I grab it. [laughter] And sheâ€™s stunned. So she goesâ€¦
[exclaims]
[laughter] And Iâ€™m so fucked up, I go, â€œWait, how come? Do you know?â€ [raucous laughter] â€œWhy are we alive?â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat? What?â€ Now luckily I have a decent friend with me, Shaun. He interjects, goes, â€œHe took an Ambien.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œOkay.â€ She just keeps going down the aisle. [laughter] Now heâ€™s worried about me, so he wakes Joey up. He goes, â€œJoey!â€ And Joeyâ€™s like, â€œWhat?â€ He goes, â€œWhat did you give Tom?â€ He goes, â€œI gave him 200 milligrams.â€ [audience exclaims, laughs] â€œDipped in hash oil.â€ [audience exclaiming] I goâ€¦ [slurred] â€œWhy you do that to me?â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œYouâ€™re gonna see the devil now, bitch.â€ [laughter]
[resounding cheers and applause]
[audience member whistles]
[applause fades]
I go, â€œI think Iâ€™m fuckinâ€™ looking at him.â€ [laughter] And letâ€™s rewind, by the way. He took five. Heâ€™s on a thousand milligrams. Likeâ€¦ [yawns] â€œWhat are you doing tomorrow?â€ â€œIâ€™m going to the hospital tomorrow. What are you doing?â€ Psycho. [crowd chuckling] But listen to me. If you have never been surprise megadosed,
it is horrific.
[laughter] It is a harrowing, panic-induced terror ride. And so a few weeks ago, I did it to my mother. Uhâ€¦
[laughter]
[scattered cheers, applause]
I did. I was visiting her. Sheâ€™s alone. She knows I eat them at night. Iâ€™ve told her they help me sleep, which they do. And she calls them â€œgummies.â€ Soâ€¦ She comes up to me and sheâ€™s likeâ€¦ [slightly accented] â€œAre you going to have a gummy tonight?â€ And I go, â€œYes.â€ She goes, â€œMay I have one?â€ And I was likeâ€¦ [laughs] â€œYeah.â€ [laughter] I give her one because I take one. And one gets me high, so Iâ€™m like, â€œThis is gonna peel back her wig.â€ You know? [laughter] I sit around with her for a couple hours. Then I ask her, â€œHow do you feel?â€ She goesâ€¦ [with emphasis] â€œI feel nothing.â€ [laughter] Like, â€œReally?â€ She goes, â€œYes.â€ I go, â€œAll right. I donâ€™t know. Go to bed, you fuckinâ€™ savage.â€
â€œI donâ€™t know what to tell you.â€
[laughter] The next day, itâ€™s evening and she comes up to me again. [mimics accent] â€œMay I have another gummy tonight?â€ I go, â€œYou had one yesterday. You didnâ€™t feel anything.â€
She goes, â€œMaybe I should take two.â€
[laughter] [clicks tongue] â€œMaybe you should.â€ [laughter] I give her two. We hang out. And again, I ask her, â€œHow do you feel?â€ She goesâ€¦ [with emphasis] â€œI feel nothing.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œReally?â€ She goes, â€œShould I take two more?â€ I said, â€œHey, Pablo, you might wanna keep it in first for a minute.â€ [laughter] She goes, â€œYou donâ€™t think so?â€ I go, â€œActually, I do think so. Here. Hereâ€™s two more.â€ I give it to her. She eats them. And then she says, â€œIâ€™m going to bed.â€ I go, â€œAll right.â€ She goes to her room. I go to the guest room. A few minutes laterâ€¦ [crowd chuckles] â€¦I receive a series of text messages that I have since memorized. [laughter] The first one says, â€œTommy, I am fizzing.â€ [laughter] F-I-Z-Zâ€¦ I-N-G. I write back, â€œSounds cool.â€ [laughter] â€˜Cause who the fuck is like, â€œIâ€™m fizzing right nowâ€? [laughter]
[scattered applause, cheers]
â€œWe out here fizzing tonight, baby.â€ I donâ€™t know what that is. She writes back, â€œMy heart rate is 125.â€ [crowd chuckles] â€œOh, I am spinning.â€ So I write, â€œLOL.â€ I think sheâ€™s having fun. [laughter] Then she writes, â€œPlease come now. I donâ€™t feel well.â€ I go into her room
and my mother is seated upright.
[laughter] In bâ€¦ That is an alarming look. For an elderly woman? Most of them lay down or lean. Sheâ€™s just in bed, likeâ€¦ [laughter] I go, â€œAre you okay?â€ She goesâ€¦ [hoarsely] â€œNo.â€ [laughter] So I take her out to the patio. Iâ€™m thinking, â€œFresh air.â€ You know? Itâ€™s clear immediately that we are in for a ride. [laughter] The first thing she does, she goesâ€¦
[smacks lips rapidly]
[laughter] [mimics accent] â€œMy lips!â€ â€œThey are stuck together.â€ [laughter]
[scattered applause]
I go, â€œIâ€™ll get you some water.â€ [crowd chuckling] And she goes, â€œWhy am I hungry?â€ [laughter]
I said, â€œâ€˜Cause itâ€™s working.â€
[laughter] And she goes, â€œThe dog was here. The dog is gone?â€ And I go, â€œOh my God.â€ [laughter] I start to laugh soâ€¦ destructively hard. [laughter] Itâ€¦ It is not, â€œHa-ha-ha.â€ It is a deep, primalâ€¦ Iâ€™m watching my 77-year-old mother get high. Iâ€™m not laughing, my nervous system is shutting down, all right? [laughter] I mean, Iâ€™m watching her look at sounds. You know, sheâ€™s likeâ€¦ [laughter] It hurts. It hurts how hardâ€¦ My esophâ€¦ Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [raspy exhaling] As Iâ€™m laughing, I look at her. And at one moment, her face contorts. Her face goesâ€¦ [laughter] And she looks at me. And she goes, â€œTomorrow, your laughter will be tears on my corpse.â€
And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
[audience exclaims] â€œWhat?!â€ She goes, â€œItâ€™s the perfect murder.â€ [laughter] â€œNobody will know it was you.â€ My lungs invert at this point. And I have tears streaming down my face. Sheâ€™s so high, she thinks my laughter is confirming her thoughts. [laughter] She starts to legit plead for her life. [laughter continues] She goes, â€œTommy, please!â€ â€œPlease!â€ â€œDonâ€™t kill me!â€ [laughter] â€œI am your mother!â€ [laughter continues] I fuckinâ€™ pass out in a chair. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [grunts] [laughter]
[applause]
[resounding cheers]
[applause fades]
I wake. I donâ€™t even know where the fuck I am. Itâ€™s morning. I walk into the kitchen at the same time as her. I go, â€œHey, Mom.â€ And she doesnâ€™t say anything. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, shit.â€ She just walks over to the coffee maker and she goesâ€¦ [sucks teeth]
â€œI know you tried to kill me last night.â€
[clamorous laughter] â€œIt was very clever.â€ [laughter continues] â€œBut I am still here, Tommy.â€ [laughter] I go, â€œI didnâ€™t try to kill you.â€ She goes, â€œOh yes, you did.â€ So I leave for the day. I come back later. I go, â€œLook, I owe you an apology.â€ â€œI should not have let you eat that much. Iâ€™m sorry.â€ She goes, â€œItâ€™s okay. I forgive you.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œReally? Thank you. Makes me feel better.â€ She goes, â€œI want to tell you one thing.â€ And I go, â€œWhat?â€ She goes, â€œI want another gummy tonight.â€ And I go, â€œWhat?â€ She eats them every day now.
Sheâ€™s doing coke. She grew her bush out.
[laughter] Sheâ€™s fuckinâ€™ the neighbors.
Sheâ€™s living her best life.
[cheering] If you ever meet her, give her drugs. Thank you guys very much for coming out. Have a great night.

London. Otherwise it would be a little bit tricky. But itâ€™s nice to just have 50 seconds of people going, â€œOh, fucking hell. Oh, no.â€
Itâ€™s good to be back with you tonight here in thisâ€¦ In this intimate aircraft hangar, I think you will agree. Treat it as my own bedroom, if you wish, or your own bedroom, or just, you know, just relax and chill out. Where shall we start the show tonight? Human sacrifice! Thereâ€™s a good place. Always gets a bit of a cheer. â€˜Cause we used to do it, didnâ€™t we? We know we used to do it. Itâ€™s dropped off a lot since the â€™50s. But we used to do it. We used to sacrifice men and women for gods. Thatâ€™s what we did. At least we didnâ€™t sacrifice men and women for other men and women. We werenâ€™t that bad. We just killed each other. Thatâ€™s a different thing, isnâ€™t it? Thatâ€™s just pure bloody murder. But we werenâ€™t as bad as people going, â€œOh, I like spoons. Iâ€™d like to get more spoons. Maybe if I kill Steve, Iâ€™ll get more spoons. I wish I did logic at school. Steve, are you busy?â€
â€œIâ€™m just going down the funfair to stick my head in the candyfloss machine and get a big pink afro.â€
â€œItâ€™s a very weird joke.â€
â€œWell, Iâ€™ve changed it every night up to here and never got a laugh.â€
â€œThat oneâ€™s a keeper, Steve. Come back in, come back in and let me know you better, young man. Oh, Dickens. Nowâ€¦â€
Some people got that.
â€œStick your head on that tree stump, will you?â€
â€œWhy?â€
â€œWell, you know, how we measure horses by hands and they are 17 hands high? We measure trees in head heights being 53 headâ€¦ Itâ€™s new. Metric weâ€™re calling it. Just stick your head right next to the tree stump, and then on the tree stumpâ€¦â€
Charles I. Charles I was a king of England. He was what we call a dick-head king. 1649 that punch line comes from. Very rarely used in stand-up comedy today. Charles I claimed the kingships of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. And he said he was appointed by God. We cut his head off, nothing happened, so apparently not. If he had been appointed by God, his execution would have sounded like this. Fa-boing! Fa-boing! Fa-bing! Fa-bing! Fa-boing! Fa-boing! â€œHang on. Think heâ€™s appointed by God, lads.â€
It was a time when people had all that long hair. He started that. He put a King Charles Spaniel on his head.
â€œLook.â€
And you could see all the courtiers, â€œOh, what a wonderful idea, My King. Your hair can hear.â€
â€œYes, it has long flappy ear things.â€
â€œShall I throw it a cough-drop? There we go.â€
â€œOh, quick, get a poodle, get a poodle. â€œl have a poodle on my head, see, I have a poodle.â€
â€œDamn, he has better hair than me.â€
â€œl have a Pekingese, sir.â€
â€œl have a dachshund, itâ€™s a bit of a throw.â€
â€œIâ€™ve got a St Bernard on my head, itâ€™s not really worked out.â€
He causedâ€¦ I am making light of King Charles I and his execution, but he did cause up to 200,000 people to die in the bloodiest wars that we had ever had. There was not one English Civil War, there were two English Civil Wars. It was him and Cromwell, that time, and Cromwellâ€™s coming in. Cromwell was saying, â€œOne person, one vote. Well, okay, one man, one vote. Well, one man with cash, one vote.â€
He was solid with his ideas. So, Charlie One was not appointed by God. I think we canâ€¦ Thereâ€™s an outside chance that he was appointed by God, but if, and only if, on the day of his execution and his demise, God was up in Heaven going, â€œDelete, delete, delete, delete. Love, Charlie One. XOXOXO. Send. Shit, whatâ€™s the password? Jesus, whatâ€™s the password?â€
â€œI canâ€™t remember, Dad, I canâ€™t, I donâ€™t know.â€
â€œYouâ€™re the one that knows all this technical stuff. Thatâ€™s why I keep you around.â€
â€œI donâ€™t, I canâ€™t remember, Dad. I had such a blinding night last night, I canâ€™t remember.â€
â€œJesus Christ!â€
Thatâ€™s where it started. It must have started there, yeah? The first father to say â€œJesus Christâ€ through clenched teeth. Jesus Christ. Oh, whatâ€™s the time, whatâ€™s the time? Itâ€™s Charlie One isâ€¦ Go and give Charlieâ€¦ Oh, God, the globeâ€™s in the wrong place. Hang on. Thereâ€™s Ethiopia, where are we? Belize, hang on. England, donâ€™t kill Charlie One, this isâ€¦ Donâ€™t kill Charlie One, this is Godâ€¦ This is the Mysterons. Donâ€™t killâ€¦â€
â€œCharlie.â€
â€œYou bastard!â€
â€œSorry, Charlie, got these new iPads, they are very good, couldnâ€™t getâ€¦ Jesusâ€¦ You look great. You look like an astronaut. Do you want an iPad? Itâ€™s really good, you can use them on the toilet, theyâ€™re great.â€
But this was 1649, right, and this is 450 years after the Magna Carta, the signing of the Magna Carta, 1215, just before lunchtime, which was when the beginnings of democracy coming back to Europe after the Greeks and the Romans had had a go. Bad King John was forced by the barons of England to sign the Magna Carta, which is Latin for â€œBig Card, if you hadnâ€™t thought about it. Sign the Big Card.â€
â€œWe canâ€™t call it a Big Card.â€
â€œMagna Carta.â€
â€œMuch better.â€
â€œDear barons of Englandâ€¦â€
If you donâ€™t know, bad King John was bad because he was a crap king as well, but he just smelt of sandwiches and was poor at kicking the ball into the goal. Heâ€™d get to the goal and goâ€¦ And it would go that way, which is probably most of us. Just me then. Okay. I have this problem, I get up toâ€¦ I was good in the middle, you know, whatâ€™s it called, mid-field, andâ€¦ No, itâ€™s years, 13â€¦ I was 13 when I last played a big game of football anyway, so I was good and I would get up there, get the ball and the ballâ€¦ Iâ€™d be so keen in frontâ€¦ â€œGet it in theâ€¦ Kick it, just kick it.â€
Does anyone else have this one? â€œJust kick it.â€
Pang!
â€œYou fucking idiot, Izzard!â€
So I didnâ€™t, Iâ€™d just assist.
â€œYou do it, you nut it in.â€
King John going, â€œHave you finished? I was doing the Magna Carta.â€
â€œIâ€™m sorry, I was just reminiscing.â€
â€œYeah, well, Iâ€™m signing the bloody thing here. Explain about me.â€
â€œYes, I was, yes.â€
So this is bad King John, barons of England, have a go.
â€œWhat are you, the referee?â€
â€œAnd play ball.â€
â€œDear barons of England, Iâ€™m terribly sorry I missed all your birthdays.â€
â€œAnd you promise to hand over some of your power in the beginnings of democracy.â€
â€œAnd I promise to hand over some of my power in the beginning of democracy.â€
â€œAnd you always play the bad guy in the Robin Hood movies.â€
â€œOh, for fuckâ€™s sake. Whoâ€™s going to play good guy?â€
â€œSean Connery play good guy.â€
Yes, as you can hear, heâ€™s in tonight. Sean Connery played in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Richard the Lionheart. My God, we had a king called Richard the Lionheart, the greatestâ€¦ I think one of the greatest English kings thatâ€™s ever been going. Great in battle, thereâ€™s a statue of him outside the Houses of Parliament, born in Oxford, fought all the fights, fought against Saladin in the Third Crusades, good-looking, played the banjo, good at football. The David Beckham of kings, right? Revered by the English, as English as English pie and he spoke French.
In interviews, â€œYouâ€™re King Richard the Lionheart?â€
â€œOui, hello, I very much excitement, Iâ€™m very pleased. Good morning.â€
â€œAre you King of England?â€
â€œOh, yes, oui, I am, hello, good morning. Bonjour, Iâ€¦ Englandâ€¦ I like it very much, I like you people, you are crazy.â€
â€œAnd you live there?â€
â€œNo, I live in France.â€
â€œWhy do you live in France?â€
â€œOh, lovely weather and the wine, you know.â€
â€œBut youâ€™re good at fighting?â€
â€œIâ€™m a very good fighter, I could kill you, I could kill that guy, I could kill that rat, you know, I just kill them very quickly.â€
â€œDid you like the battle today?â€
â€œVery good battle, I thought, I thought we were good in the second half, I felt, you came in. Saladin, very good manager of his team, theyâ€™re Muslims. They fought very well, you know, I have a lot of respect for him. We shook hands at the end of the game andâ€¦â€
â€œMaybe we should make peace, you know, because weâ€™re both Abrahamic faiths, itâ€™s a bit insane to murder each other, but hopefully these wars will sort of tail off within about two or three years. Or if not, a thousand years. Or if not, theyâ€™ll just keep going and then weâ€™ll blow up.â€
â€œDo you know some English songs?â€
â€œOh, sure. Sur le pont dâ€™Avignonâ€¦ Hereâ€™s one.â€
Maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m an Oxforder.
Thatâ€™s true, that is, he spoke hardly any English. And 300 years we had those kings. But this is Richard the Lionheart. What a name to get! Because we had kings like Edward the Confessor, I think that was me, sorry about that.â€
Ethelred the Unready, â€œWhat, now?â€
Steve the Stupid, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
Kenny the Collapsible, â€œI could fit in a bag.â€
And Roger the Rotund, â€œIâ€™ve eaten a pig.â€
There are lions not even called Lionheart. There are lions called, â€œI am just called Lenny.â€
â€œLenin, like the, like the Russian guy?â€
â€œNo, Lenny, Lenny, Lenny the Lion.â€
â€œI thought Lenin the Lion, that would be quite fun.â€
â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€
â€œIâ€™m Steve.â€
â€œThereâ€™s quite a lot of Steves in this show.â€
â€œYes, yes, he doesnâ€™t like thinking up new names. Lenny is quite unusual.â€
â€œItâ€™s actually Lenin, Iâ€™ve just changed it to Lenin actually.â€
â€œOh, itâ€™s quite a mobile show?â€
â€œYes, yes. Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got a lionâ€™s heart.â€
â€œIâ€™ve got a duckâ€™s heart.â€
â€œOh, and for why?â€
â€œI swapped it with a duck in a poker game.â€
â€œAny disadvantages?â€
â€œMany.â€
â€œBut Iâ€™m good at bobbing for apples.â€
â€œYou didnâ€™t even know you were going to say that, did you?â€
â€œNo, I didnâ€™t. I was going to say something else and it did tumble from my mouth.â€
â€œYou realise we both have the same accent?â€
â€œOh, yes, thatâ€™s not good. Thatâ€™s not good at all.â€
â€œNo, it isnâ€™t.â€
Now, this is interesting. Richard the Lionheart was a king during the 300 years from William the Conqueror to Henry V when in England we had the French-speaking kings, right? So French was the kingly language, French was the judiciary language and the bishopsâ€™ language, you know, the religious language, and everyone was writing it down and saying how it should be spelt. Anglo-Saxon English was free, it was like a slang language. No-one was writing anything down. We were the lifters and carriers going, â€œWould you like another sausage? All right, hereâ€™s another sausage for Frenchy here, all right, come on then, more sausages, they love their sausages.â€
And in that time, in those 300 years we got rid of the masculine and feminine of the words.
Someone in that 300 years said, â€œHey, guys, guys, see this spoon? From now on, letâ€™s call it a spoon.â€
â€œBut is it a masculine or a feminine spoon?â€
â€œA fucking spoon, Steve! Just get a grip, man!â€
â€œWell, surely it must be a neutered one?â€
â€œItâ€™s just a fucking spoon.â€
â€œBut if the spoon owns a dog, would it be the dog of the spoon? If the spoon is sent away on an errand, would it be going to the place or away from the spoon, of the spoon?â€
â€œItâ€™s a fucking spoon!â€
â€œBut how will we know on theâ€¦â€
â€œJust put words around it to tell us which way the spoon is going.â€
â€œAnd what if thereâ€™s more than one?â€
â€œThen we put an â€˜Sâ€™ on the end. Spoons? Thatâ€™s when it happened. No one knows who did it. Somewhere in there, they just said, â€œItâ€™s just a spoon, come on, get a grip.â€
And thatâ€™s why itâ€™s taken over. Itâ€™s no longer our language, I would say, we have given it to the world. It is the language of Shakespeare, yes, but itâ€™s the language of rock â€˜nâ€™ roll, the language of Hollywood, the language of Australia, and English is no longer an invasionary language. Thatâ€™s very interesting, isnâ€™t it? We used to invade with it, we used to go and say, â€œHello, weâ€™ve come with guns and flags. I see you havenâ€™t got any of these. What weâ€™d really like is your raw materials. How about that?â€
â€œI assume you are saying, â€˜Yes, help yourselfâ€™.â€
â€œWeâ€™re just going to dig all this out of the ground. Yes, raw minerals. Very good, yes. On a wheelbarrow. Now stand back please or Iâ€™ll hit you with a shovel. All right, there we go. Now, goodbye, weâ€™ll see you every five seconds for the rest of time.â€
Romans, you know, they used Latin as an invasionary language. Caesar was going round going, â€œWe take over all of this France and now we go to Britannia. Okay, hello, Britannia. We got the big hats and the big gear and what you got?â€
â€œWe got stones and â€˜Vâ€™ signs.â€
â€œThese are not very good, okay, weâ€™re going to take over your place, thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to do. You have two choices here, you join us or you die.â€
â€œMultiple choice, I like that. D.â€
â€œNo, no, no, no, itâ€™s two choices.â€
â€œYou join us or you die.â€
â€œOh, I donâ€™t want to die.â€
â€œWell then, you join us.â€
â€œIâ€™d rather not.â€
â€œThen you die!â€
â€œI donâ€™t want to die.â€
â€œYouâ€™ve got to choose one or the other.â€
â€œSwitzerland.â€
â€œWhy do you say Switzerland? There is no Switzerland. I donâ€™t know what you mean.â€
â€œJustâ€¦ Okay, tell me what improvements you will make in our town if you come in.â€
â€œOkay, we take your town, you see all these houses here, these little mud huts and stuff, and then weâ€™ll flatten them and weâ€™ll put a great big aqueduct through and then there will be a lot of water coming into your town and then going straight out to the next town and youâ€™ll have no water but it will drip down, trickle-down effect, trickle down.â€
â€œâ€˜Water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.â€™ Okay?â€
â€œSo basically youâ€™re fascist plumbers, are you?â€
â€œYes.â€
But I like the Buddhists. The Buddhists they believe in the real guy, itâ€™s a philosophy, not a religion. They believe in Geoff Buddha, real bloke. And you canâ€™t tell whether he is a big lad or a trim lad because in India all the Buddhas are trim Jims, yeah, and all the Chinese Buddhas are big lads, so I assume he started in India going, â€œI have many ideas. We must head towards enlightenment and being awake and awakening, head to Nirvana and see their gigs and then come back, okay?â€
â€œThis is whatâ€¦ It is a new way, control your ego. These are veryâ€¦ I like this food as well, itâ€™s really good. Another two naans please and one grandmother, thank you. Come, let us go to China. Bring this food.â€
â€œWell, how much of it?â€
â€œAll of it.â€
So thatâ€™s what happened. So if you want to become a Buddhist monk, you can do it, anyone can do it. You go from unenlightenedâ€¦
â€œHuh?â€
To first level of enlightenmentâ€¦ â€œOh!â€
Then red belt, green belt, brown belt, black belt.
â€œOw, for fuckâ€™s sake.â€
Then you become a Buddhist monk and you shave your head and youâ€™ll look like Yul Brynner and youâ€™ll wear orange, which is a difficult colour to wear. But everyone in Holland wears it and hard-line Protestants in Northern Ireland. Itâ€™s the Axis of Bizarreness. Itâ€™s a wife-swapping programme just waiting to happen. And then you are a Buddhist monk, youâ€™re enlightened, you are achieving nirvana and live in a monastery high on the mountains and you have a big gong and you hit it. And all the other Buddhists come running in, â€œIs it lunch?â€
â€œNo, I just hit the gong.â€
â€œWell, what does it signify?â€
â€œEvery time I hit a gong a Buddhist monk gets his wings.â€
â€œThat was another film, I donâ€™t know what heâ€™s on about.â€
But they control their ego and it doesnâ€™t help us against the fascists. They go round flame-throwing, murdering with guns. And if a Buddhist monk wishes to complain against extremists, he sets fire to himself. I think the Nazis just go, â€œWell, thatâ€™s what we were going to do, so thanks for saving us the petrol.â€
So itâ€™s okay to have an ego, thatâ€™s what I think, you know, most of us have egos. President Lincoln in 1861 in America said, â€œThe better angels of our natureâ€.
Weâ€™re trying to get our egos to dovetail, I think thatâ€™s what it is and as a performer you need to have an ego. I need to bound on stage and say, â€œThree men went into a pub, Englishman, Irishman, Scotsman, Welshman, â€œChinese man, Venezuelan man, Burgundian crossbowman, two kippers, a banana, and a helicopter went into a pub, and the landlord said, â€˜What the fuckâ€™s going on?â€™ â€˜Itâ€™s an Izzard joke, I donâ€™t know.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™m not serving the helicopter.â€™ â€˜You bastard!'â€
All right, forget that. Now you know these arenas? I have played a fair few arenas in my time and Wembley was one of the first ones I played, in London Wembley Arena, and I remember, I played it about 12 times and I went there recently to watch Jesus Christ Superstar. A musical, yeah, and I went to watch that andâ€¦ Wembley Arena, and afterwards I get in a taxi, back in 45 minutes out of the centre and taxi-driver, Asian British taxi-driver said, â€œWhere would you like to go?â€
â€œI would like to go back to Piccadilly, please.â€
â€œNo problem.â€
â€œAnd how will we get there, my good man?â€
â€œIn my car, I have a car attached to the steering wheel, you see. Do you not understand the principles of mime?â€
So we drive off into town and weâ€™re chatting away and when we get to Piccadilly he says, â€œRight, now, will you be going back to Wembley?â€
And I thought, â€œMy God,â€ my ego kicked in at this point and I thought, Iâ€™m getting through to the Asian community. He knows how many times Iâ€™ve played Wembley.â€
I went off on one and I said, â€œYes, I think I will be going back to Wembley, thank you for the question. I think I have to go back to Wembley, donâ€™t you? I struggled so hard to get there.â€
â€œWas it traffic?â€
â€œIn some ways I think I will forever be going back to Wembley.â€
Thereâ€™ll always be a Wembley And he was going, â€œWell, hereâ€™s my card. Iâ€™m working till 3:00 am. this morning, I can give you a lift back, you see.â€
â€œOh, tonight? No, no, no, I donâ€™t live there.â€
â€œWhat were you talking about?â€
â€œThe demons, they come in my mind, Iâ€¦ What part of Wales are you from? Iâ€™m from Swansea actually. My motherâ€™s from Swansea, my father from Mumbai. I am an Indian Welsh person and my accent is somewhere in between the two, donâ€™t you know, boyo? Probably, I understand. Cooking is very difficult. Would you like a steering wheel?â€
â€œI am fine, thank you, Iâ€™ve just eaten, thank you all the same.â€
So in Wembley I went to see Jesus Christ Superstar, and itâ€™s a musical and I donâ€™t know musicals. Iâ€™m an action transvestite. I donâ€™t know what they are on about. I know action movies, I know Die Hard one, two, three, four, five is it now? Terminator one, two, three. I know those films. I put on make-up, I go out and I fight things, not actually, but in my mind, you know? Fuck, lipstickâ€™s everywhere, you know? You know the problems. Iâ€™d go watch Die Hard: The Musical. Yippee ki-ay, motherfucker Yippee ki-ay, motherfucker Yippee ki-ay Iâ€™m in the Nakatomi Towers Nakatomi Towers My wifeâ€™s downstairs and thereâ€™re some terrorists there And one of them is kind of German But probably not â€™cause weâ€™ve done that before And Alan Rickman does a very good American accent But musicals it seems to me they can be about anything, theyâ€™ve just got to be upbeat and people have got to win in the end and you just sing,
Iâ€™ve lost my trousers Heâ€™s lost his trousers Where can they go, where have they gone Walked away They walked away in the night Was it a thief Or were they burnt in a fire Or did mice steal them Put them on their heads Look like Big Ears and run away And they felt they were dogs in the night Oh, I donâ€™t know Heâ€™ll have to go to Trouser Mountain Trouser Mountain, go to Trouser Mountain Yeah, get a new pair of trousers
Heâ€™ll go to Trouser Mountain and thereâ€¦ Anything, as long as it ends upbeat and you get another bloody pair of trousers.
Fine.
Iâ€™ve lost three legs Heâ€™s lost three legs How can that be? Heâ€™s only got two to start with Heâ€™s lost, heâ€™s lost one more than is possible Heâ€™s got a negative number of legs Thatâ€™s impossible Unless heâ€™s a mathematician No, heâ€™s a spider, a spider He started with eight and ended up with only five using basic mathematics Five legs, thatâ€™s okay Most of us have two, but heâ€™s got five So whatâ€™s he crying about in his soup Pull off one more, heâ€™ll have four Thatâ€™ll look pretty good No, thereâ€™s four down one side And one on the other And if you pull that one off Heâ€™ll just go over Need to go to Wheel Mountain To get a wheel on the other side
Youâ€™ve probably heard these musicals before. Theyâ€¦ Thank you for that small round of applause, but itâ€¦ Music makes you applaud, you know. Comedy doesnâ€™t, comedy, you just go, â€œOkay, fuck it.â€
Whereas music could be, Iâ€™ve lost cheese down my trousers My monkeyâ€™s made of Spam My brother lives in a helicopter And he eats out of a can Iâ€™ve got no knees, Iâ€™ve got no cheese Iâ€™ve got no monkeys except in a breeze And when things goâ€¦ As long as it vaguely rhymes. Cheese comes upâ€¦ Then Sellotape your head to the back of a chair I havenâ€™t finished yet. And then weâ€™ll die It was a bit of a weird last line, wasnâ€™t it? Thatâ€™s not in most musicals, â€œAnd then weâ€™ll dieâ€.
Dye your hair bright green andâ€¦ Okay, letâ€™s go. Itâ€™s not going to get better than that. No, I was watching Jesi-quesi Superstary and itâ€™s a religious story and, yes, heâ€™s in tonight andâ€¦ Itâ€™s a religious story, but I think itâ€™s a secular version with Tim Riceâ€™s lyrics, itâ€™s almost the Judas story, not Jesi-quesi Superstar, but Judi-crusi Superstar, with Judas going, â€œCome on, Jesus, letâ€™s get the fascists, man, theyâ€™re fascist plumbers, they do things with the water thatâ€™s illegal.
â€œStop washing your hair.â€
â€œI got to wash my hair, man.â€
â€œWhy?â€
â€œI canâ€™t remember any wi-fi passcodes and I got to wash my hair. I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s got two in one.â€
â€œWe could give that to the poor.â€
â€œThey donâ€™t want to wash their hair.â€
â€œCanâ€™t say that, youâ€™re a big twit.â€
And that bit when Pontius Pilateâ€¦ Who was a pilot, by the way. He flew for the Romans, you know, flew bald-headed eagles and once flew one straight through a toupee factory with obvious consequences.
â€œCanâ€™t fucking see, man, fucking hair in my eyes.â€
A Hobbitâ€™s going, â€œLook, the eagles, the eaglesâ€¦â€
â€œYou all right, mate?â€
â€œI couldnâ€™t see, got hair in my eyes.â€
â€œIs that your hair?â€
â€œNo, I got it at the toupee factory.â€
Thatâ€™s in the second version of Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings: The Hairy Eagles. Back to the Jesi-quesi the musical, itâ€™s about the father/son sacrifice and human sacrifice was the other way round. We used to do it, if I can route all the way back to the beginning. We used to kill people for gods, â€™cause gods love praise. Oh, they do. Oh, they do. All prayers are full of praise. â€œDear God, Thou art amazing, Thou art stunning.
â€œI love what You are wearing, I assume, because I canâ€™t see it. Thou did build a world, Thou did make it round and didnâ€™t tell anyone, And the Spanish Inquisition, it was so inquisitive, hopefully You got some good information out of that that You can use in Guantanamo Bay. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, the cheese and the cheeseboard, the fish and the fingers.â€
And then hymns are just more of the same, the singing version, Hallelujah, hallelujah Praise God until your tongue explodes Till your knees drop off Till your eyes go wonky in your head Praise and praise him And God must be up there every Sunday goingâ€¦ â€œThey love us down there.â€
â€œLouder, louder, louder!â€
â€œPut a backbeat in! Where are the gospel singers? Do Kumbaya. Do you do requests? Jesus, come on! Holy Ghost! Angel Gabriel.â€
So why the hell were we killing people because people have to do all the praising? It doesnâ€™t make any sense. Itâ€™s immoral, itâ€™s illogical and it takes a hell of a lot of cleaning up with a Dyson. Hereâ€™s the logic. Crops used to fail in the old days, people thought the gods were in charge of anything. Theyâ€™d say, â€œThe gods hate us, we must please the gods.â€
â€œLetâ€™s do a dance for the gods.â€
Logical. Sing a song, We love youâ€¦ Logical. Carve a love-heart in the sand. Logical. Bake him a cake. Logical. But what bloody right-wing extremist said, â€œThe crops have failed, the gods hate us, letâ€™s kill Steve!â€
What the fuck was all that about? These are the things that I would have argued as I was being dragged off to be sacrificed. â€œDonâ€™t kill me, Iâ€™m a praiser. No, Iâ€™m good at it, Iâ€™m a loudmouth. Get the quiet people first. Get the librarians, theyâ€™re allâ€¦â€
And it was always virgins, wasnâ€™t it? And so if we were all in the tribe and they were sacrificing virgins and we were virgins, we would do something about it, wouldnâ€™t we? We would fuck each other. Fuck a friend and save a life. Boys would use it as a pick-up line.
â€œJanine, weâ€™re good friends, arenâ€™t we? Have you heard of the fuck-a-friend programme? Come on, Janine. Come on, Janine Birds do it. Birds do it, bees do it, not together, thatâ€™s illegal.â€
It was always the priests that were doing all the sacrificing, dragging up virgins, â€œCome on, we must sacrifice these two virgins right now. We can do it. And then the godsâ€¦ Hey! Stop that, stop it, stop. Damn.â€
â€œWell, they were virgins thenâ€¦ All right, get a tent, thank you.â€
â€œLook, Iâ€™ve got a hundred lined up outside, theyâ€™re all virgins, so we can sacrificeâ€¦ Stop it, stop that. Bugger! Shouldnâ€™t have made them stand in a circle, I suppose.â€
Thatâ€™s your joke, thatâ€™s your joke, I didnâ€™t say anything. I just gave you a mathematical symbol. There was always the priest with the big hats, the long dresses, bone through their nose, early transvestites from the dark side.
â€œCome on, you mustâ€¦â€
â€œWhy must I?â€
â€œâ€˜Cause you didnâ€™t do it.â€
â€œl was up for doing it.â€
â€œItâ€™s all about timing, kid.â€
â€œNo, thatâ€™s comedy.â€
â€œThatâ€™s true. The secret of comedy and human sacrifice.â€
â€œHow are you killing me?â€
â€œUsing the traditional method.â€
â€œDid you use to play the xylophone?â€
â€œA little bit, a little bit.â€
â€œIs that a rolling pin youâ€™re using?â€
â€œIt is a rolling pin.â€
â€œWhat am I? Puff pastry?â€
â€œSomewhat like it.â€
Ah! Ooh!
â€œGood luck, God, you great big invisible bastard.â€
And goats as well.
â€œCome on, you goats.â€
â€œWhat the hell did we do?â€
â€œYou know what you did.â€
â€œLook, Iâ€™m not in a relationship with you. Just tell me what I did, all right, just be precise.â€
â€œWell, you look like the devil, thatâ€™s why.â€
â€œNo, we look like the Roman god Bacchus, and then when Constantine took the Romans into Christianity, they were all scratchy about the god of partying and getting it on, so we were demonised because we had little pointy bits coming out of our heads. But elk have got an entire coat rack coming out either side of their heads, and thatâ€™s just fine and dandy.â€
â€œLook, these are facts. Iâ€™m a fascist, I donâ€™t know about facts. Donâ€™t you know the three rules of fascism? Make shit up, scream it loudly, then kill people.â€
Hitler came up with the Jewish Bolshevik conspiracy. Now youâ€™ve heard this many times, it was screamed out in Nazi Germany for many years, itâ€™s garbage from the beginning to the end. The Jewish people demonised, â€™cause they were supposed to be all about money and the Bolsheviks were hated, â€™cause they were not into money. What? What the hell did they have a conspiracy about, disagreeing? Thatâ€™s just garbage, just like the Nazis going on, â€œItâ€™s the farmer astronaut conspiracy. Can you not see how the farmers, they plough the fields with the oxen and they lay the seeds and then the astronautsâ€¦ Can you not see the links? The dog helicopter conspiracy. Every time a helicopter lands, dogs goâ€¦ They are talking to the helicopters. The sock banana conspiracy. They almost look the same. And a banana can get inside a sock, but not the other way round.â€
So many goats have died throughout the years. Think about the guy and his Prodigal Son. â€œMy Prodigal Son has returned, he has prodded everything. Have you finished prodding?â€
â€œl have prodded everything, Father.â€
â€œAnd what have you learned?â€
â€œSome people are spongy. â€œAnd some people you can dent your finger on.â€
â€œWell, we will celebrate, we will slaughter a lamb and slaughter a goat and slaughter the next-door neighbours.â€
Itâ€™s just too much slaughtering, what was this? Most goats die badly, donâ€™t they? Very few goats die in their beds surrounded by their families, drinking a glass of Stella Artois, like in the advert. So there should be hundreds of thousands of goat ghosts. No oneâ€™s ever seen one. And then thereâ€™s cow ghosts. Cows have been turned into beef burgers so many times, they even talk like ghosts when they are alive. The Meatpacking District in New York, they were slaughter-houses before, now they are hotels and restaurants, completely gentrified. In the same buildings where cows for decades, if not centuries, walked in going, â€œYes, I was talking to Daisy andâ€¦ Oh, my God!â€
People should be in those hotels going, â€œGet these cows out of my room, man, theyâ€™re ghostly cows. I donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing. One of them broke into the mini-bar and he drank all the milk, man. Thatâ€™s like cannibalism. Get it out of here. And the Chicken Caesar Salad, thank you.â€
Do you think Caesarâ€™s a bit pissed off that chicken is now mentioned before him? When Caesar died did he go, â€œEt tu, Bruteâ€? Or did he go, â€œMake a salad out of me, but donâ€™t let a chicken come before me in the title.â€
Unless they knew each other and worked together. Unless Caesar was going, â€œOkay, we take over all these places. I am a ruthless politician, I know not much about attacking and all these things. What do we do now? We are going into France? Vercingetorix, heâ€™s a strong leader, what do I do? Mark Antony, tell me.â€
â€œOkay, move my troops in.â€
â€œOkay, surround them.â€
â€œSet up fortifications.â€
â€œOkay, what if other people come from the other side to help them?â€
â€œA second line of fortifications around the first?â€
â€œThat will be the Battle of Alesia?â€
â€œWow! Now keep wearing the helmet, otherwise people will know youâ€™re a chicken, yeah? You look good in this stuff. How are the new electronic legs working?â€
â€œGood!â€
I donâ€™t know much about ghosts. I think ghosts have to be a troubled soul that dies in a tragic way, then they appear at the window of a ghostly house going, â€œWhere is my lover, my lover has left me. Heathcliff, where have you gone? Youâ€™ve left Aberdeen and gone to Yorkshire to marry the Bronte sisters and hang out with Branwell whoâ€™s like a pickle, I think. Heâ€™s had so much opium, what can I do? Iâ€™ve taken up smoking since youâ€™ve left. Will you come back to Scotland? No, I donâ€™t know what to do. What shall I do?â€
â€œI should take my forces down as far as Derby.â€
â€œAnd put Bonnie Prince Charlie on the throne of England.â€
â€œAnd he will be a Catholic.â€
â€œYouâ€™re not a marriage guidance counsellor at all, are you?â€
â€œBut you have a certain thing about you. Whatâ€™s your name?â€
â€œTony. â€œTony. Youâ€™re quite fetching, arenâ€™t you?â€
â€œHowâ€™d you get hydraulics?â€
â€œToo tricky to explain in this show.â€
Okay, fear, if anyone is a more sensitive kind of person who suffers from fear or gets fear, you know, quite a lot, I have worked out how to kill fear. Fear, you know, can take over your mind and just paralyse you, but I know an emotion that can conquer fear and I found this out just by accident. It just came to me in an epiphany moment. Fear is very strong, as you know, and there is one emotion that can kill it and that isâ€¦ Boredom. Think about it. You canâ€™t be scared and bored. Itâ€™s impossible. I just discovered this. I donâ€™t know what you can do with it, but youâ€™ve gotâ€¦ Next time youâ€™re somewhere spooky and youâ€™re scared and going, â€œWhere is everybody? Is anyone out there? Who is it? God, itâ€™s so dark.â€
In the paper-rock-scissors of life, boredom is stronger than fear. Fear causes diarrhoea. And diarrhoea puts the excitement back into boredom. You canâ€™t have diarrhoea and be bored. Itâ€™s called Ethelred the Unready. Thatâ€™s code in Accident and Emergency. Youâ€™re going, â€œNo, itâ€™s not. It could be.â€
In emergency. â€œThereâ€™s an Ethelred the Unready coming.â€
â€œOkay. Get the buckets. And the headgear.â€
Now, if you are a religious person, that is cool, because I donâ€™t believe in religion, but it could be out there, it could be out there hiding under a bucket or something, I donâ€™t know, but there are some religious people still left in Europe. The Pope is not religious, he obviously said, â€œI donâ€™t want to do this no more. I have left this thing, itâ€™s crazy, I am leaving here now. Danke schÃ¶n and auf Wiedersehen. â€œThe Pope, out.â€
Heâ€™s probably smoking cigars and driving the big fast cars. â€œI donâ€™t fucking care anymore. Get out of the way. Iâ€™m an ex-Pope, I donâ€™t care.â€
Bear in mind, you can be religious all your life and you get to Heaven, there could be a Heaven, and you get there, God might not speak English. So you could get up there and go, â€œHello, is this Heaven? Iâ€™ve tried to be good all my life. I hear that Heavenâ€™s like a big spa. Is it nice, can I come in? Am I on the list, hello?â€
â€œOh, no!â€
â€œI got a â€˜Dâ€™ at school. Umâ€¦ No, thatâ€™s not good. If l speak louder, do you understand me better? Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll just go to Hell, shall I? All my life trying to go to Heaven, now Iâ€™ve got to go to bloody Hell. All the time I tried to be good, get on Santaâ€™s good list. Is this Hell? Itâ€™s got doors. Hello, is this Hell?â€
â€œYes, sir, this is Hell.â€
â€œThank God, you speak English.â€
â€œYes, the English run Hell, donâ€™t you know, sir.â€
â€œNow, I havenâ€™t reserved, can I come in?â€
â€œWell, weâ€™re very busy at the moment, sir. Margaret Thatcherâ€™s just come in, and sheâ€™s over there. So weâ€™ll try and fit you in somewhere. Where would you like to sit?â€
â€œTable by the fire?â€
â€œTheyâ€™re all by the fire, sir.â€
â€œYes, yes, yes.â€
Experts now believe the only difference between Heaven and Hell is that in Heaven there are toilets and in Hell there are no toilets. You have to hold it in forever. Or there are those toilets without toilets. You know the ones that start pretty good with a nice piece of porcelain down here, and they get to that hole and instead of building it up a little, they just go, â€œFuck it.â€
And sometimes, in France sometimes, they are in cool places. Only five per cent of toilets in France like that, sometimes they have very cool toilets in France. You know, the ones with shared basins and everyoneâ€™s getting on very well but sometimes you could be in somewhere like Montmartre, centre of Paris, and everyoneâ€™s there with berets and dark glasses, and smoking Gitanes and drinking espresso.
â€œSomeoneâ€™s stolen the toilet! Thereâ€™s no toilet here.â€
And then you look back, you think, â€œOh, no, thereâ€™s a hole there. Oh, my God, maybe it is a toilet.â€
And then you realise that it is a toilet, because you can see on either side of the hole the footprints of astronauts. And you go, â€œNo, this is not good. This isnâ€™t cool, guys. My iPadâ€™s going to go straight in. You guys had a revolution, why are you doing this? Itâ€™s crazy.â€
And they did. Iâ€™m telling them this in French. I said, â€œYou had a revolution.â€
1789, they stormed the Bastille, this famous fortress prison and they got all the prisoners out.
â€œCome on, you prisoners, youâ€™re free. Libres! Come on.â€
Imagine the prisoners blinking in the light. â€œWhatâ€™s going on?â€
â€œIt is the revolution, my friend.â€
â€œThe King and Queen?â€
â€œThey are dead.â€
â€œThe aristocracy?â€
â€œIt has gone.â€
â€œAnd the toilets?â€
â€œWell, we are going to keep them the same.â€
â€œWeâ€™re going to phase them out over the next million years.â€
Oh, dear. But if a God did turn up, weâ€™d want him to sound in a certain way. Weâ€™d want him to sound deep and throaty. If a God turned up and said, â€œI have returned. I have been away for many years, and now I am back. And you, you people of Europe, you do not go to church any more. What are you doing on a Sunday?â€
â€œWe are watching box sets of Scandinavian psycho-dramas.â€
â€œDidnâ€™t expect that answer.â€
â€œYes, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Fish with the Banana Haircut, The Cheese Sandwich That Ate Itself, Wallander Billander Ballander Gillander, The Girl With The Lumpy Jumper. â€œ
â€œRight, well, I donâ€™t know what to say to that, but now I have returned, will you come back to church?â€
â€œWe will not come back to church.â€
â€œAnd why not?â€
â€œBecause your voice is too high. â€œYou built us, you made us not trust the high-voiced people.â€
This is true, isnâ€™t it? We will not follow the high-voiced people into battle. â€œCome on! Have at thee, have at thee, have at thee, take that and that. Wait, where is everyone? Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more, Or close the wall up with our English dead! In peace thereâ€™s nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility, But when the winds of war blow in our ears, Then imitate the actions of a tigerâ€¦ Come on!â€
â€œYou go ahead, weâ€™ll come in the next wave, second wave, all right? Gotta change my shoes, got the wrong heels on for war. All right, good luck. Right, Ietâ€™s just go home, shall we?â€
No, we want a God to sound more like this. â€œI am God. I have been away for many thousands of years. And now I have returned. And I have taken up scuba diving. â€˜Cause I like to watch the little fishes as they come byâ€¦ Oh, look there is a yellow one.â€
And then the instructor goes, â€œNo, that is Prinkippia Flintaltalus.â€
He goes, â€œIt looks like a yellow one to me.â€
â€œBut anyway, now I am hungry. I must go to the canteen and get some food.â€
â€œGood woman, what food do you have here?â€
â€œWe have lots of food today in the canteen. We have salad nicoise, all the way from Nice. We have Cobb salad made entirely from male swans. We have chicken Caesar salad, very popular with chickens and ex-dictators. We have sausage, egg and chips and the enigma variations thereof. And we also have spaghetti alla carbonara.â€
â€œDo I need a tray?â€
â€œNo, you do not need a tray. Trays have been banned in this canteen. Eight years ago there was a fight and many people died upon the floor. The day was only saved by Mr Stevens, Head of Catering. He did come into the fray and did pick up a tray, and immediately it fell out of his hands, because it was wet and he picked up another one and that one fell out of his hands, because it was wet, a third and a fourth fell from his hands. The fifth one he staple-gunned to his hand and then he went into action. Pang! Pang! Pang-pang! Pang! Sometimes with the edge of it. Even now people sing songs about that day.â€
â€œSuch as?â€
Mr Stevens He fought like two demons Who were insane with a tray And he fought with a tray And he panged people in their face And panged them dead And panged them all around Mr Stevens He pangs people in the face He panged them to the left And he panged them to the right And if he ran at them straight on Heâ€™d do a forward pang Or heâ€™d use the edge bit And thatâ€™s why we sing songs of Mr Stevens
â€œSo I donâ€™t need a tray then, I take it? What do you do with the food?â€
â€œWeâ€™ll just pour it into your hands.â€
â€œThatâ€™s a bit bloody weird. I will have the spaghetti alla carbonara.â€
â€œNo, thatâ€™s saved for Lord Vader.â€
â€œDo you know who I am?â€
â€œNot another bloody game of â€˜who the fuck are youâ€™? I donâ€™t know, you are dressed as a scuba diver, so are you Simon the Scuba Diver?â€
â€œNo, I am God. God the chosen one, the self-choosing chosen one. The big cheese, the big kahuna, the numero uno, top banana. Have you heard of the Big Bang? I said go.â€
â€œLook, all right, youâ€™re obviously big into yourself. Iâ€™ll put your name on it all right, God, so if he doesnâ€™t come in five minutes, you can have it. Whatâ€™s your first name?â€
â€œMy first name? You want to know the first name of God? You want to know my first name? Do you want to know the first name of God? Itâ€™s Steve.â€
â€œAll right, Steve God, then you, this isâ€¦ Oh, Lord Vader.â€
â€œWho are you?â€
â€œI am God. Who are you?â€
â€œI am Vader.â€
â€œI want spaghetti alla carbonara.â€
â€œSo do I.â€
â€œBloody hell! Mr Stevens, Head of Catering.â€
Pang! Pang! Pang! Just will you take your bloody food and sit down.â€
â€œOh, terribly sorry, I just got carried away. Iâ€™ll share my spaghetti alla carbonara with you.â€
â€œOkay, okay, okay, Iâ€™ll have sausage, egg and chips. Yes, Iâ€™ll have some of your chips.â€
Itâ€™s a bit of a saga now. I was watching a documentary the other day called Clash of the Titans, right. They were all there, all those great titans. There was Diana, the god of hunting, Roger, the god of baked potatoes. Minerva, the god of wisdom, and Siobhan, the god of dangerous spelling. For the god Siobhan said, I will start with the letter S and I will go through the entire Scrabble board before I get to the letter N. And that will fuck up dyslexics around the world who think my name is spelt like Shivaughn when in fact I am Siobhan.â€
And another titan was there, that was Zeus playing the role of the god Liam Neeson. Liam Neeson is a kind of god all the way from Ballymena in Northern Ireland. He has conquered Hollywood, and he is quite often in quite mainstream films now like Battleship where everyoneâ€™s going, â€œLetâ€™s put pigs in a bag before the metal people come out of the water and pee on our heads.â€
He is holding onto logic. I think heâ€™s hired to hold onto the centre of the film. â€œIâ€™ve got the centre of the film, lads, Iâ€™ll just hold onto sensible stuff here.â€
In the film the people on earth are just behaving badly and Zeus is up there going, â€œWhat the hellâ€™s going on down there?â€
This is very early Liam Neeson impression I am doing, okay, when he was still about 15, back in Ballymena. â€œYou tell them, theyâ€™d better buck their ideas up, otherwise I will release the Kraken, so I will.â€
Now, if you donâ€™t know about the Kraken, the Kraken is a huge turtle in the film, and it is as angry as you can believe. You know, turtles normally are kind ofâ€¦ And when turtles get angry, they look kind ofâ€¦ But this one isâ€¦ Kind of crazy. So halfway through the film, Zeus is as good as his word, and he says, â€œRight, release the Kraken and tell the Kraken to get down there, get down there to Lesbos, Besbos, Whizbos and Gizbos, right? Find the ringleaders, set fire to their houses, burn their boats, and pee on their relatives, and remove their underwear and throw it in the hedges. And just generally rubbish them in the local amateur dramatic press.â€
So the Kraken is released from under the water. He comes outâ€¦ With no plan. Look at his eyes, no plan, itâ€™s a George W. Bush Kraken. Then he stamps on things. Basic right-wing foreign policy. Probably for two or three weeks. Probably about week four and week five. Probably about week 10, heâ€™s got bored and heâ€™s moved to Mexico, and heâ€™s hanging out with a lot of Vietnam veterans playing poker.
â€œHeâ€™s all right, the Kraken.â€
â€œHe can play the ukulele.â€
Oh, Mr Stevens But in the film they said, and Mr Zeus, Mr Liam Neeson said, â€œRelease the Kraken.â€
But at no point did he ever go, â€œRetrieve the Kraken.â€
The Krakenâ€™s still out there, still wandering around Greece going, â€œIâ€™ve no idea what Iâ€™m doing any more. No, Iâ€™m not very good on financial matters, terribly sorry, Iâ€™m just a Kraken really. I stamp on things, thatâ€™s what I do. Sorry, I think youâ€™re supposed to pay some taxes at some point, not really sure. Look, good luck on getting it all together again but, you know, come on, you got to try to make this thing work, otherwise itâ€™s going to be hell to pay when Izzard goes stamping around.â€
But they did have a great idea back in the old days, the idea of having a healthy mind and a healthy body. I remember reading this, itâ€™s a Greek idea, â€œMens sana in corpore sano, thatâ€™s the Latin for the Greek idea, I think. And the idea that this and this both worked. I couldnâ€™t work thatâ€¦ Surely this works and this isâ€¦ Or this works and this is tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet. Thatâ€™s what I thought, you know. Remember when we were kids, this was good, wasnâ€™t it, â€œCome on, run, run.â€
â€œWhy are we running?â€
â€œThere could be ice-creams over there.â€
But in our heads, it was like those early computer games, wasnâ€™t it? Nothing much going on. Now our minds are sharp, we can multi-task. We can sit on our toilets and use an iPad at the same time. Go poos and send an email. But our bodies, our bodies are like two weasels covered in gravy, and nailed to the back of a tractor. And you know that Iâ€™ve done a little bit of running about, â€™cause I was trying to get this bit working with this bit, you know. I was trying to head back to this ancient Greek Olympic idea. And remember this and I have only just noticed this. All wild animals are fit, all of them, 100%. You know, lions, tigers, cheetahs, blah, blah, all of them. Flying ones, all of them.
Some people said sloth. One person said, â€œOh, sloth.â€
No, â€™cause sloth, they hang out of trees, but forever. They are not hanging out of trees goingâ€¦ â€œShit, Iâ€™m not really fit for this hanging out of trees shit.â€
They hang out of trees for a goodâ€¦ And they are one of the seven deadly sins. Thatâ€™s a pretty good double. Do they know that, has anyone told them?
â€œDo you realise that we are one of the seven deadly sins?â€
â€œReally?â€
â€œDo you have any more material for this scene?â€
â€œI donâ€™t really, Iâ€™ve just thought of it.â€
Think about lions. 100% of lions are fit. 100%. Itâ€™s not like 80% of lions are 92% fit, or 53% of lions are 47% fit. 100% of lions, youâ€™ve never seen a lion goingâ€¦ â€œFucking gazelles. Are they on drugs? Are they taking drugs? I donâ€™t know. How do they go so fucking fast? I shouldnâ€™t have eaten those hedgehogs.â€
Youâ€™ve also never seen a lion goingâ€¦ â€œBloody hamstring. Go on, go on, get him, get him. Itâ€™s a hamstring, itâ€™s an old injury. Bring on the trainer from 1970s football.â€
Then a lion with a bucket and a sponge would come over. â€œThink Iâ€™ve torn the patella. I think there is ligament damage. I think itâ€™s right up to here, I might have smashed my hip and itâ€™s fallen over. And somethingâ€™s really pulling on my neck and it feels likeâ€¦ That bit of my face feels really weird. Iâ€™m not a bloody car!â€
What was going on with the bucket? The elixir of life? They should have just come on with the bucket and goneâ€¦ â€œNow get up.â€
But lions are fit. Thank you, 12 people. Lionsâ€¦ Lions are completely fit, arenâ€™t they? Lions, tigers, panthers, cheetahs, theyâ€™re not cheaters, theyâ€™re honesters. Theyâ€™re not taking drugs. I donâ€™t know who started that rumour. So itâ€™s all those chasing ones, theyâ€™re fit, but also the chasees, theyâ€™re fit, too. So all the gazelles and all the giraffe and the buffalo, fit, fit, fit, fit, fit. And the middle-sized ones, warthogs and hyenas, and a third one I canâ€™t think of, fit, fit, fit. And moles going, â€œCome on, dig, dig.â€
â€œWhy are we digging?â€
â€œThere could be ice-creams underground.â€
â€œOkay.â€
Hmm. Do you think moles ever goâ€¦ â€œI think weâ€™re lost.â€
â€œGive me the map. I canâ€™t see anything on this.â€
â€œItâ€™s not a map, itâ€™s a piece of brown paper.â€
â€œBloody idiot.â€
â€œHang on, I can hear something.â€
â€œThat was Steve McQueen.â€
â€œThereâ€™s a German prison camp that way. Heâ€™s getting out.â€
â€œHeâ€™s going to Switzerland with chinos on.â€
â€œThatâ€™s good. Everyone over about 40 will understand that joke.â€
â€œWhoâ€™s Steve McQueen?â€
â€œWhoâ€™s Steve McQueen?â€
â€œHeâ€™s that guy down there.â€
Follow my logic. Gold exists underground, yeah? Undeniable logic, moles dig underground. Undeniable logic. Thereâ€™s no above-ground moles, or youâ€™d be going, â€œFucking moles!â€
No, youâ€™re never going to get that. If gold exists underground and moles dig underground, some moles must have struck gold. Thatâ€™s just got to be true. There must have been, in the history of moles in the history of the world, some mole that wentâ€¦ â€œGold! Weâ€™ve struck gold! High threes.â€
â€œGold, gold, gold, weâ€™re rich! Calling all moles, calling all moles!â€
And moles come from miles around and they dig all the gold up and they become rich and they sell it all and they buy houses in Beverly Hills, and they get people to drive them round.
â€œWhere would you like to go?â€
â€œI want to go to Swansea, man.â€
â€œI can take you to Swansea, I live in Swansea.â€
Itâ€™s great, they have eye operations and big cigars. And they live high on the hog. They have advisors. â€œWhat should I do with my money?â€
â€œPut it all into silver?â€
â€œThatâ€™s crazy.â€
â€œYou donâ€™t know anything, do you?â€
â€œStay in the car.â€
But then the Olympics did come to town. Yes, it did, it did come to Britain and just beforeâ€¦ Yes, it was a good Olympics, was it not? Yes. We were not quite expecting that, were we? I donâ€™t know if you remember, just before the Olympics, there was that thing that happened in Britain. Maybe itâ€™s a British thing, maybe itâ€™s a human thing, but we suddenly went into, â€œThis is going to be really expensive and all the people are going to come and oh, my God, theyâ€™ll all speak different languages and weâ€™ll have to talk loudly to them.â€
But then we started winning, left, right and centre, upside down. Well, everybody was going crazy. And all those sports anyone can do, and that was one of the greatâ€¦ Except for one or two. Thereâ€™s one or two that are still kind of posh. Rowing, you got to go to a school thatâ€™s got a river. You canâ€™t do it and be in an inner-city school sitting in your bath going, â€œI was pretty good in the bath.â€
â€œThe waterâ€™s got to be on the outside of the bath.â€
â€œOh, on the outside? I got it all back to front.â€
And horse-riding, you need a bloody horse, right? And the horses are in tonight, soâ€¦ You need to have a horse. You canâ€™t live in an inner-city school and say, â€œI found a Great Dane in a skip, and he only had front legs, but he used to drag himself round, game boy, he was.â€
You need horses, you need many horses. And it cuts down into jumping over things and the dressage. The jumping over things based on ancient hunting techniques of running and jumping, and dressage based on fuck knows what. Ancient dressage. Itâ€™s a French word, dressage, translated into English, it means dressage. Where does it come from? Maybe the Surrealist Wars. Maybe at a time when people said, â€œYou men and you women, get on your horses, ride towards the enemy. Feint right, cut left, duck down, go along like this, come up, do this, eyes and teeth, eyes and teeth, sing, Mr Stevens, go to Trouser Mountainâ€
What is going on? Because who watches it? You must admit you donâ€™t go, â€œWhenâ€™s the dressage on? Whenâ€™s it on?â€
It just comes up on the screen and you goâ€¦ Oh. And when it comes on, you go, â€œHas it been on an hour, a year? Have they finished? Is he a spider?â€
Just the horses doing things. You think, â€œThese people are on crack, whatâ€™s going on?â€
I salute them, though, I salute, because they got us medals and they trained hard, but why? â€˜Cause they can do things that are of no use ever in life, unless you wish to park your horse in a cupboard.
â€œHeâ€™s going up to the cupboard now, approaching the cupboard now. â€œHere comes Lucky Jim ridden by Lady Jane Trains. Itâ€™s got one door open of the cupboard, heâ€™s going to get the horse in the cupboard, itâ€™s a very difficult manoeuvre. Heâ€™s got the second door is open of the cupboard. Heâ€™s in, heâ€™s backed into the cupboard there. Itâ€™s a very good move there. Drawers open, heâ€™s stepping into the drawers, heâ€™s closing the drawers, pulling that one door shut, pulling another door shut. Itâ€™s the first horse in a cupboard for 20 years. Four points. Scorers give four points and for an extra point, can you see Narnia?â€
â€œI think so through the back of the thing.â€
â€œExtra point for Narnia, there we go.â€
And itâ€™s just a little bit weird. If people walk up to you, you tend to think theyâ€™re standard people, but if you saw anyone coming up to you like this, youâ€™d go, â€œWhat the hell is this guy doing?â€
They just look a bit, theyâ€™re training horses to look like burglars, you know. And thereâ€™s nothing to burgle, is there? They should build a structure then the viewing figures would go up through the roof.
â€œHere comes Lucky Jim, heâ€™s coming up to the building now, itâ€™s been specially built for the occasion. â€œHas three rooms inside, one has a safe with the jewels inside. Lucky Jim cameâ€¦ Got the bronze medal in Helsinki and got the silver medal in Timbuktu, and now here he comes. Once he gets in and breaks into the structure, the clock starts, four minutes to get out. The clock has started, the window is open. There he is. Heâ€™s into the kitchen, heâ€™s going round the kitchen, opening the drawers of the kitchen, the horse is opening the lower drawers, the riderâ€™s opening the upper drawers, going up there turning on all the taps, I donâ€™t know what heâ€™s doing there, heâ€™s spun round, thatâ€™s very good. Going into the bedroom, going round there, looking under the bedâ€¦ Theyâ€™ve sat down on the bed, thatâ€™s quite good, thatâ€™s quite fun. Heâ€™s going for a cupboard, heâ€™s going for a cupboard. One, two, three, four. Heâ€™s into the drawers, heâ€™s locked the cupboard. Four falls and a submission, heâ€™s coming back round, heâ€™s coming back. Out of the thing, heâ€™s into the lounge, still hasnâ€™t found the safe, behind the picture, behind the pelmet, I donâ€™t know. Heâ€™s looking at things, going in the drawers, coming overâ€¦ Itâ€™s there, heâ€™s found the safe. Opening with hooves now, heâ€™s using his hooves. Opening the safe, can he open the thing with his hooves? Itâ€™s open, heâ€™s got jewellery round the neck, earrings onâ€¦ Heâ€™s got the valuables, now heâ€™s coming out. He has to get back down here to retrace his steps, he does a spin. Comes back up out of the thing. Windowâ€™s open, heâ€™s coming out of the thing, heâ€™s goingâ€¦â€
Weâ€™d watch that, wouldnâ€™t we? Oh, yes. And itâ€™s the only animal that does dressage. There are no others. Thereâ€™s no dog dressage. Dogs are at those dog shows and they get taken round on a lead and they just do this.
â€œThis is all I can do, this is all I can do, go round in circles.â€
Cat dressage would be impossible.
â€œThis room is big enough.â€
Yak dressage. Big lads, are yaks. Theyâ€™re not very active in the dressage department. Yak dressage is pretty similar to British Tai Chi. And think of Genghis Khan. He knew about horses.
â€œAll right, my men, I have trained you to ride on horses, fight on horses, eat, sleep and breathe on horses. You willâ€¦â€
â€œAre you Sean Connery?â€
â€œIâ€™m a little bit like him.
â€œJust donâ€™t touch, lad. Iâ€™m using my Gorky Park, The Hunt for Red October. No, itâ€™s not Siberian, where am I? Mongolian. Slightly more Mongolian.â€
â€œI think youâ€™re just Sean Connery, arenâ€™t you?â€
â€œShut your face. We will ride on our horses across the plains of Mongolia to the Steppes of Russia, down the Steppes of Russia, into the basement of Russia and back up the escalator of Russia. And on into the pages of Wikipedia. Will you ride with me, will you ride? I, Genghis Khan, will lead you. Benghis, will you come?â€
â€œYes, Genghis.â€
â€œDenghis?â€
â€œAll right, Genghis.â€
â€œThengis?â€
â€œHow are you naming us?â€
â€œUsing the Tolkien method of alliteration. Siobhan, are you coming? Put the Scrabble set away, if you will, love. Steve, will you ride with us?â€
â€œI willâ€¦ I wonâ€™t be coming this time actually. I wonâ€™t be coming this time actually, Genghis. â€˜Cause I bought this horse and heâ€™s a little bit weird. I bought him with some magic beans and he just does things which are not useful. But Iâ€™ve parked in the cupboard three times. Good thing is if you roll him over and make him breathe out, you can dry your hands in his mouth. Thatâ€™s quite fun.â€
It is a true thing. Dressage was true, they used to ride into battle with the big Iances. And then get into the melee of people and itâ€™s all blood and guts and all horrible, and then the people try and kill the horses and then they use dressage to get out. Said, â€œGet out, dressage, dressage.â€
And the horses would get out.
Theyâ€™d say, â€œWhy didnâ€™t you kill the horse?â€
â€œI didnâ€™t know what he was doing. I thought it was half-time entertainment.â€
Itâ€™s like ballet, you see. Sometimes they call it horse ballet, and ballet is again, who watches ballet? It must be people who do dressage. They just watch each other and go, â€œOh, yours is similar to ours, you know.â€
And ballet is straight women and gay men doing amazing stuff. No-one getting hurt and no-one having sex. And women wear tutus and the men wear stuff that even I as a transvestite would say, â€œReally, are you sure?â€
Itâ€™s always best to leave something to your imagination before the imagination explodes. So the Olympics tells us what we can do with a healthy body, but with a healthy mind, maybe we can gain wisdom, yes. And for wisdom, in the old days, we had pipes. Everyone had pipes, didnâ€™t they? You stick a pipe in your mouth, suddenly you were wise. A bit weird, you didnâ€™t have to be wise, you just stuck it in and wentâ€¦ â€œThatâ€™s a very good point. I see what youâ€™re saying. No, I didnâ€™t think of it that way. Look at the stars, isnâ€™t that amazing? Look, whereâ€™s Orion gone? Look at his belt.â€
No one said silly things with a pipe in their mouth, no one said, â€œIâ€™m going to put my dick in this toaster now.â€
So wise things were said by pipe smokers, but not any more, yeah? You wouldnâ€™t ask pipe smokersâ€™ opinion now, you wouldnâ€™t say, â€œWhatâ€™s going on in this town, hellâ€™s going on in this town. What shall we do? Maybe we should talk to those people who all smoke pipes and live in that one house.â€
Bing-bong. â€œYeah?â€
â€œThere are terrible things, we have no salad, the cucumbers are gone, and the radishes. The balsamic vinegar, itâ€™s almost gone. What do we do?â€
â€œFind the people, Sellotape their legs together. Put their eyeballs in the different sockets. Rearrange their tongues. Count their toes and put them on the numbers backwards. Would you like some crack?â€
Do people who smoke crack ever go, â€œMaybe this is the crack talkingâ€¦ But I think we should all nail our foreskins to that rocket, what do you say? Bad idea.â€
Then there was Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings, a big pipe smoking film that starts in the Misty Mountains where a Hobbit goes, â€œWhat is this? A golden ring. Should I put it on and marry someone, or put it on, become invisible and take over the world? Two obvious logical choices. I donâ€™t know what to do. What does it say? One ring to rule them, one ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and have a big party and nail some of their toes together while smoking crack. What? Thatâ€™s weird. Who is that in the darkness?â€
â€œMy precious.â€
â€œWho? Who are you and talking about precious?â€
â€œIt is me, Lady Smeagol, I am lady of the Misty Mountains. These are my caves. Iâ€™ve lost my precious.â€
â€œIs your precious a small band of gold?â€
â€œNo, itâ€™s a chicken called Tony with electronic legs.â€
â€œTony, where have you been?â€
â€œYouâ€™ve been down the goblin market, oh, have you?
â€œYouâ€™ve got some candles.â€
â€œAnd some throw cushions. You can never have too many throw cushions. Well, if you have 800 million, thatâ€™s too many, I suppose. What else?â€
â€œGoblin codpiece, well, put it on.â€
â€œTony, I think weâ€™re staying in tonight.â€
â€œI feel like a third wheel over here. Iâ€™ve come to the Misty Mountains to find my density or destiny orâ€¦ I brought a humidifier.â€
â€œA humidifier in the Misty Mountains? That will just make it the Very Misty Mountains.â€
â€œShould I have bought a de-humidifier?â€
â€œThat would just make it the Mountains.â€
Then Sauron was on the rise again, and Saruman, two people who sound to a dyslexic kid like the same person. And the NASDAQ is on the rise, then the NASDAQâ€™s on the fall, the NASDAQ rises and falls, stocks and shares going crazy. And the Fellowship of the Ring ran to Rivendell where Gandalf says, â€œSomeone must take the ring of power, and they must take it to Mordor.â€
Which has nine Râ€™s in it. â€œSomeone must take it, I do not know who.â€
â€œI cannot take it, â€™cause I am tall, immensely powerful and cannot die.â€
Why didnâ€™t he volunteer? Why did he never? â€œI have no idea who could take it, maybe some small twit couldâ€¦â€
â€œI will take it. I will take it. I, Frodo, will take it all the way to Mordor. But I am but half a man, I do not know the way.â€
â€œI am a dwarf, I am two-thirds of a man. I will help the half a man, then we will be a total ofâ€¦ Oh, shit! About one and a bit men.â€
â€œYes, but what precisely?â€
â€œAragorn?â€
â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
â€œYou?â€
â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
â€œIâ€™m just here with this rocket.â€
â€œI didnâ€™t know we had a rocket programme.â€
â€œItâ€™s six, isnâ€™t it? Itâ€™s one half of a man, plus two thirds, then weâ€™ll beâ€¦ Itâ€™s six. We will be seven sixths.â€
â€œYes, yes, yes. Aragorn, will you join us?â€
â€œI, Aragorn, will join you, and then I am a man. I am one and one ratio to men. So six, six, weâ€™ll be 13 sixths.â€
â€œThis is a bloody complicated scene, this is.â€
â€œLegolas, are you coming?â€
â€œI am four-fifths of a man, maybe I should stay here.â€
â€œNo, come, lad, come, then weâ€™ll be thirtieths, itâ€™s thirtieths, thatâ€™s 30 divided, 89 thirtieths, thatâ€™s a bloody army, that is.â€
â€œThatâ€™s just three men. You realise that itâ€™s three men?â€
â€œOh, bloody hell. What do you think, Zeus?â€
â€œWell, since Elrond has left, I, Zeus, have taken over this place, so I have, and I am running the whole of Legoland here. You people need a plan, so I think I should hand over now to my military advisor, who will advise you how to take this thing to Mordor, all right?â€
â€œAll right. I understand. Basically weâ€™re using the Battle of Austerlitz, Napoleonâ€™s plan to use, the Pratzen Heights will be Mount Doom. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s going to work, please explain more.â€
â€œHead of Military Intelligence, Lady Smeagol.â€
â€œAbsolutely, I will do this. We will be going and youâ€™re the Fellowship of the Ring, Aragorn and Frodo and Gimli and Legolas and Bagpuss, all five of you. Will go on, with the help of the Kraken.â€
â€œHello, everybody, how are you doing?â€
â€œHeâ€™s our orc-stamper general, and will be leading the diversion away from the big mountain there, and then weâ€™ve got the two moles who are going to tunnel their way in.â€
â€œHello.â€
â€œTheir names are Pinky and Perky.â€
This is going to be bloody difficult when I do this show in French. Iâ€™ll have to do a Scottish accent in French, for fuckâ€™s sake. Then they went off, they went off towards Mordor, through cats and dogs and orcs and fish with fingers. And they get to Mount Doom and they re-release the Kraken.
â€œGood luck, everyone!â€
Stamping on orcs and the moles said, â€œCome on, dig, use the map.â€
â€œItâ€™s no good.â€
They get into the centre of Mount Doom, the toilet without a toilet and then throw the ring in.
â€œYou must throw the ring in, my love.â€
â€œNo, you canâ€™t keep it, you will become a powerful chicken.â€
â€œYou will become immensely powerful and like Cate Blanchett in that film.â€
â€œDo you not love me? Throw the ring in and then we can be together.â€
â€œThis is no good. Who will beat some sense into this crazy chicken?â€
â€œMr Stevens, Head of Catering, I didnâ€™t expect you.â€
â€œI came a-running with my tray, Iâ€™m here. You bloody chicken.â€
Pang! Pang! Pang!
â€œDo you understand now?â€
â€œThrow it in, my love.â€
And the ring fell down, down into eternity, and the chicken lost all the power in the world and the ability to tell everyone to be quiet when he was doing the last bit of the show. And the abilityâ€¦ No, no, thatâ€™s great. And the ability to grind peopleâ€™s faces into the dust, but the chicken and Lady Smeagol, they gained love, they gained wisdom and the greatest set of codpieces ever found in the goblin market.
Thank you very much for watching.

How the fuck we doing, Miami?
[Cheers and applause]
Thank you. I love you, too! Thank you. I do. I really do love you guys. I mean, I swear. I love people. Iâ€™m a lover of life. You know what I mean? Life in general. And itâ€™s like, as you get older, I learned, Iâ€™m like 90% love, but thereâ€™s, like, 10% of shit I hate. A lot of things I hateâ€¦ Well, people hateâ€¦ Come from fear, right? The thing I hate most comes from the thing I fear most. And it comes from, like, childhood trauma. And this is gonna sound crazy to you, butâ€¦ [Sighs] Okay, fuck it. I am so scared of n*ggas with outie belly buttons. Itâ€™s just something evil about a n*gga with a outie belly button. You know what Iâ€™m talking about? Like, Andre McLaurinâ€¦ he had an outie belly button. He was the bully in my hood. He terrorized me my whole childhood. He was an evil little n*gglet. 4 years old, he was buff. Look like Kevin Hart buff. Likeâ€¦ Looked like he just got out of baby prison and shit. And he was a kid. 4 years old, he had lats. The only way you get lats is from doing prison time and doing pull-ups. He was a badass little kid. He was so evil, his first baby tooth, it came in chipped. [Laughter] And he was an evil fucker. He used to always steal the one cherry out of my fruit cocktail at lunchtime. And if you went to a public school, you know how much that fucking one cherry meant to you? It took you 15 cups to get to the fucking cherry. Otherwise, it was all grapes and fucking nectarines. Yo, I donâ€™t want that shit. I want a cherry! And Andre, he had an outie belly button, right, and he had this six-pack. And the outie belly button looked like someone threw a Vienna sausage at that n*ggaâ€™s stomach and it caught. [Grunts] He was bowlegged. All them little outie belly button dudes, theyâ€¦ They all bowlegged â€™cause they mama make â€™em walk when they only 5 months old before their legs harden. [Laughs] And then she give himâ€¦ Because she doesnâ€™t believe in walkers or strollers. She goes, â€œThose are for pussies!â€ She make him walk when he 5 months old and she give him man responsibility, â€™cause you know his daddy ainâ€™t there. Oh, outie belly button n*ggas ainâ€™t got no daddy, shit. And they make them goâ€¦ â€œTake your little brother Lamar to school!â€ And she put Lamar on his neck, and be, â€œIâ€™ll take him,â€ and that weighed down his legs. So he walk around with heavy-ass Lamar on his shoulders, and now he gotta go, â€œTake Dede to daycare!â€ And now he gotta drag his little brother Dede to daycare. â€œCome on!â€ And she always screams shit to him out the window. Quit smoking my Newports! â€œI know itâ€™s you, you piece of shit!â€ That was his little nickname. â€œPiece of shit!â€ He be out till, like, 5:30 in the morning with his saggy diaper full of shit, justâ€¦ Oh, they ainâ€™t potty trained. Outie belly button n*ggas is dumb as shit. They canâ€™t read or write or donâ€™t know their ABCâ€™s or 123s, but theyâ€™re super athletic. They can backflip into a public pool with their jeans and sneakers on. So he walking around the neighborhood just looking for trouble with a little saggy-ass diaper hanging out his fucking G-Star jeans, and he just looking for trouble. Walking around the neighborhood, smoking his mamaâ€™s cigarettes, justâ€¦[Inhaling] But heâ€™s still a kid, so he suck his thumb, too. [Laughs] Never fight a b*tch with a outie belly button. You will lose that fight. Oh, let me tell you something, outie belly button women, they can do two things. They can fight, and they can fuckinâ€™ Double Dutch. Oh, shit. They always got Vaseline in their back pocket. And they put it on their face and say evil shit like, â€œOh, b*tch, this what I wanted you to do! Oh, b*tch, I prayed for God you was gonna fuck with me today, ho! Ooh, Iâ€™ma fuck you up.â€ And they always gotâ€¦ They always got littleâ€¦ Little â€œB*tch, I can fightâ€ hairdos. They got cornrows, right? But the cornrows be real little, â€™cause they ainâ€™t got a lot of hair, so it look like stitches. Look like Wolverine wentâ€¦ [Deep voice] â€œGet over here, b*tch!â€ [Normal voice] And they hairâ€™s so small [chuckles] the shit be unraveling. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So they put them little colorful hair braids on the back, but half the time, they canâ€™t afford that, so they put them Venus and Serena braidsâ€¦ Beadsâ€¦ on the end, and clump them with some aluminum foil? And God forbid if she got that â€œb*tch, I could fightâ€ ponytail. You know them little ponytail? It look more like a Rottweiler tail or a Doberman Pinscher tail? Itâ€™s a little struggle tail. Oh, and her girlfriend help her get that little bit of hair in a ponytail, be like, â€œShit, sit still, Faye, sit still! We almost got it!â€ And the hair never make it. The ponytail never make it. All this be broke off. There will be, like, nine scraggly hairs here and, like, seven over here. And she gotta slick it down with some Vaseline and try to make some baby hair. But one time she sweat, boom, that shit come right back up. And all this be bald as shit. This be bald. Look like somebody fading her shit at all times. But itâ€™s â€™cause all the stress from trying to have a ponytail when, b*tch, you ainâ€™t got no hair, soâ€¦ Her eyes be sâ€¦ Real tight, you know? She got the tight eyes? Itâ€™s because she actually gotta put her skin in the ponytail to make the ponytail reach. And when it reaches, itâ€™s finally, itâ€™s a little, little ponytail. [Childâ€™s voice] Oh, itâ€™s so little! And it look likeâ€¦ [Normal voice] B*tch look like a water balloon. Iâ€™ma give you some stats on outie belly button people, and then we can move on, â€™cause Iâ€™m really offending this brother with the outie belly button in the front row. Him and his comrade. Uh, these are real statistics. You can look it up after the show. Uh, Google it. Whatever search engine you use, Safari perhaps. Firefox.

You know that 87.3% of our entire prison system is filled with n*ggas with outie belly buttons. 84.6% of all the fathers that donâ€™t take care of their children. Itâ€™s a shame. Outie belly bâ€¦ [Laughs] Every rapper thatâ€™s ever been to prison? The n*gga got a outie belly button. I ainâ€™t lyinâ€™. They always got they shirt off in pictures. Google it.

[Chuckles] I know, this is real shit. You know whatâ€™s funny? I almost didnâ€™t have children, because I was afraid one of them was gonna have an outie belly button. I got kids, got two. [Applause] Yes. Some brave woman let me cum in her twice. And thatâ€™s 90 pâ€¦ I love them, man. My daughter, she just graduated, uh, high school. [Cheers and applause] And she went to her prom.

Ladies, yâ€™all ainâ€™t shit. Yâ€™all ainâ€™t shit. Ainâ€™t nobody correct me. None of yâ€™all are worth a damn cent. Look at yâ€™all. You gonna sit here and let me and your n*gga next to you believe that you lost it prom night? Yeah, right. You know you lost that shit in the tenth grade in some fucking stairwell to a random Puerto Rican named Orlando. [Chuckles] Prom nightâ€™s just the first night your nasty ass gonna do it in the bed, and your daddy gotta pay for it. See, I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t like the setup â€™cause I feel like a sucker as a father. â€œCause prom night is not about impressing the daughter or the mother. No. See, the mother and the daughter, they in cahoots with this little motherfucker across town, whoâ€™s trying to come fuck your daughter. Thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re trying to do, fuck your daughter. Whatâ€™s he doing? Trying to fuck your daughter. And he come, and he come, he think he Prince Charming. He pull up in a limousine. Oh, heâ€™s wearing a tuxedo, and he has these shiny tuxedo shoes on. And he rings the doorbell all respectfully. [Imitates doorbell] Boom-boom. And you open the door, and he says some really polite thing like, â€œHow are you, Mr. Wayans? Itâ€™s a pleasure to meet your acquaintance. Iâ€™m here to pick up Amai.â€ And then he produces a corsage. â€œOoh, a corsage! Ooh, for my daughter?â€ Oh! You gentleman, you! Here. Fuck her. â€œYou fuck my daughter, you gentleman, you!â€ Get the fuck outta here with that bullâ€¦ Slap you in your little face. Donâ€™t come to my door with that shit. Donâ€™t do that. You come to my house, you trying to bang my daughter, be a man! You wanna pick up my daughter? Be a man. Donâ€™t come in some limousine your daddy rented for you. No, Iâ€™m not impressed.

Nah, donâ€™t wear no tuxedo. Some rent-a-tux. Come on, man. You wear it today, but it was on a dead body yesterday. You smell like embalming fluid. You come to my house, you show upâ€¦ Iâ€™m a â€™90s n*gga. So you come to my house, impress me. You wear a pair of FUBU jeans. Yeah, some Karl Kani, something with some big writing on the pocket. And make sure you have an Aniche shirt and a Mecca sweater over that. Tie a Phat Farm cardigan around your neck. Yeah, and then have a Eight-Ball jacket just sitting off your shoulders like Dom Perignon. And then you have a Yankee fitted thatâ€™s not that fitted just sitting off the side of your dome. And donâ€™t bend the brim. Leave that shit new! Donâ€™t bend the brim. And you better not take the sticker off. I wanna see that little black sticker with your head size. I wanna be like, â€œOh! Seven and five eighths? Oh, he got a big-ass head. Heâ€™s smart!â€ And when you come to my house, do me a favor. Donâ€™t ring my doorbell. [Imitating doorbell] Boom-boom. Nah. Nah. Letâ€™s be real.

Come with someâ€¦ Knock on my door. Knock! Let me hear you knock. Donâ€™t ring my doorbell. Knock. Yeah, thatâ€™s a real n*gga right there. And let me hear your intentions in the knock. I wanna hear your knock say, â€œIâ€™m here to fuck your daughter!â€ You feel me? Thatâ€¦ that gets my attention. â€œBoom-boomâ€ donâ€™t get my attention. N*gga, I be on the toilet taking a shit, I hear â€œBoom-boom, boom-boom,â€ I ignore it. I just keep checking my Instagram. â€œBoom-boom, boom-boom,â€ dropping my load.

Yeah, my pussy made that pussy, so respect the guy when you come through! Donâ€™t say no smart shit to me, [Mocking voice] â€œHow you doing Mr. Wayâ€¦â€ [Normal voice] Shut up! Just look at me and have some compassion, have some empathy. You took your S.A.T.? Thatâ€™s a S.A.T. word. You took your S.A.T.â€™s, you got a 870 or over, you know what the fuck empathy is. â€œCause you give me that look like you know what the fuck Iâ€™m going through as a father. I open the door, be likeâ€¦ [makes creaking sound] â€œJust give me that look like you understand, likeâ€¦â€ [Exhales] [Sighs] Then say some cool shit likeâ€¦ [Inhales deeply] [Deep voice] â€œYou know what it is.â€ [Normal voice] â€œYou know what it is.â€ Thatâ€™s real n*gga talk right there. You won my heart with â€œYou know what it is,â€ â€™cause â€œYou know what it isâ€ says so much without saying shit. So, letâ€™s say likeâ€¦ And brothers understand this. Like, letâ€™s say Iâ€™m leaving the amphitheater tonight and I see some young brothers outside and they wanna rob me. And they see itâ€™s me, and they be impressed like, â€œOh, shit!â€ N*gga, thatâ€™s Marlon Wayans! Oh, I love you! Wayans Brothers? Wayans Brothers? Wayans Brothers? Come on, my guy.

[Cheers and applause]
â€œYo, thatâ€¦ Yeah, it was a little gay, but, n*gga, that shit was funny though. But, yo, yo, I love yâ€™all, man! Yo, my family love your family, but, yoâ€¦â€ [Sniffs] â€œMe and my n*ggas is hungry.â€ And you got that little chain on, you know what Iâ€™m saying? And I like them sneakers you got on. So as much as I love youâ€¦ [sniffs] â€œYou know what it is.â€
[Cheers and applause]
[Normal voice] Somebody give me that shit, and here, â€œTake the chain. Take my sneakers.â€ Thatâ€™s a real n*gga right there. Donâ€™t even pull the gun out, just take it. The heist is done. Same thing with my daughter. â€œN*gga, here, take her, take her, take her. She deserve a real n*gga like you.â€ And then when you grab her, grab her hand and be like, â€œYo, listen, you did a good job, man. Just do yourself a favor. Donâ€™t wait up.â€ And pull up on your skateboard, ka-ta, ka-ta, ka-ta. And donâ€™t let her on. Let her chase after you like a real n*gga. And then turn around and show me your outie belly button like, â€œYou know what it is! You know this shit is real!â€ I actually had no anxiety at all on my daughterâ€™s prom night. Not a drop. Know why? â€˜Cause my daughterâ€™s gay, so, yeah. [Chuckles] That took allâ€¦ All the anxiety away. You know whatâ€™s funny? Knowing that my daughter wasnâ€™t gonna be banging some dude or getting pregnant or having no disease, Iâ€¦ That doorbell rang, I was so relieved. I went to the doorbellâ€¦ Boom-boom! I looked through the peephole, I seen it was a girl, I said, â€œYes!â€ [Laughs] â€œOoh, this b*tch is bad, too. Hey, how you doing? Ah, donâ€™t call me Mr. Wayans, call me Mama!â€ [Smooches] â€œAmai, your date is here!â€ Oh, baby girl, donâ€™t you look beautiful? Look at you. Donâ€™t she look pretty? But why your dress so long, girl? Hike your dress up. Yeah, show some pussy. She hoâ€¦ Yeah. Girl, you safe. This like fishing. Throw that chum in the water. Go on, show some pussy! â€œNow, you girls have fun. Donâ€™t do nothing I wouldnâ€™t do.â€ [Evil laugh] â€œNow, check it out, I got yâ€™all a little hotel room, and guess what? Itâ€™s a suite! Curfew? B*tch, stay out till Thursday, yeesh.â€ â€œNow, check it out, I got yâ€™all some party favors.â€ I got you, uh [sniffs] I got you a little bit of weed. Just tell the driver you want some collard greens, he got that shit rolled up for you. I got you some liquor. I got that good liquor. I got that Ciroc. Yeah, that shit that make Diddy and his kids dance like this. Every time they hear â€œCiroc,â€ they just be dancing like this. Here, take this Molly. Take the Molly. Donâ€™t do the whole pill. I got this shit from Miami, â€œI donâ€™t know what the fuck is in this shit.â€ [Cheers and applause] â€œJust give her half, and you take the other half. You do the whole thing, trust me, itâ€™s gonna be really hard for you to eat vagina like this.â€ [Chuckles] Thatâ€™s just how it was, man. I ainâ€™t trippinâ€™. My daughter told me she was gay when she was, uh, she was how old? She was 15 years old. And, uh, you know, I realized Iâ€™m not God. I canâ€™t judge. Iâ€™m a father. And my job as a father is to love my daughter unconditionally, no matter what. So, I told my daughter, you know, I said, â€œListen, baby girl,â€ I said, â€œYou know, I accept you, but for you,â€ I said, â€œDonâ€™t be concreted in your thoughtsâ€, because youâ€™re still a baby. I mean, life is not a sprint. This is a marathon. â€œAnd what you love today, you may hate tomorrow.â€ And I cited an example, I said, â€œRemember when you was little, you hated peas?â€ Yeah, you did. You fucking hated peas. And what did we do? We went to the bookstore, and we got that book. â€˜Green Eggs and Hamâ€™ by Dr. Seuss. Now who loves peas? You do! Right, so letâ€™s go to the bookstore, and letâ€™s see if we can find another book. â€˜Green Eggs and Dickâ€™ by Dr. Seuss. Yeah, and Daddy will read it to you â€œlike I did when you was little.â€ [Clears throat] â€œâ€˜You can suck it in the park.â€ You can fuck it in the dark. You can suck it in the rain. Watch out for big, buff, Black dick. It will surely give you pain. Oh, dick, it comes in all shapes. Some are narrow, some are wide! Some are round at the top and others have sleeves. They call those uncircumcised. And if you know these dicks Iâ€™m speaking, the uncircumcised ones usually belong â€œto Dominicans and Puerto Ricans.'â€
[Laughter]
[Chuckles] No, but my daughter was like, â€œNo, Dad, youâ€™re not getting it.â€ She said, â€œIâ€™m gay, so you love me or you leave me alone.â€ And she gave me two options, but I only heard one, which is to love her, right? Yeah. I mean, it actually made me look at myself. Like, the fact that sheâ€™s living her truth? I picked up the mirror and I said, â€œShit, am I living my truth? Iâ€™m lying here next to her mother every night, and this shit donâ€™t feel right.â€ â€œIâ€™m wearing these skinny-ass leather pants thatâ€™s giving me male camel toe. What the fuck is going on?â€ And I realized something. I wasnâ€™t living my truth. And I thanked my daughter. I said, â€œThank you, you freed me.â€ I said, â€œBaby girl, Daddy likes pussy, too.â€ â€œI do! Oh, I love pussy! Not your mamaâ€™s. Iâ€™m tired of that shit.â€ Iâ€™ve been fucking that for 25 years. Itâ€™s like an old piece of chewing gum. I just wanna put it up underneath a desk and watch it get on somebody elseâ€™s jeans and be laughing. Iâ€™ve learned I like all kinds of pussy. I like White pussy. Yes, I said it, sisters. And Iâ€™ll say it to your face. I like White pussy. So white, you can hear the â€œHâ€ when I pronounce it. Hh-white! And look at this brother, he smiling. He said, â€œMan, me too!â€ And I like them a little racist. I like a little Karen. Iâ€™ll go downâ€¦ Iâ€™ll go down to Sarasota and grab me a fucking Karen, and Iâ€™ll fuck her ass and change her whole perspective. Iâ€™ll put that dick so deep, sheâ€™ll be like, [Screaming] â€œBlack Lives Matter!â€
[Cheers and applause, laughter]
And I like Latina chocha. SÃ­! Me gusta Latina chocha mucho! Yeah, I like the gorda labias. Ah, yes. And [with accent] yes, yes. [Normal voice] And then I fuck, and she fucking call me names, she like, â€œAy, negrito sucio!â€ And I say, â€œSÃ­.â€ Negrito suâ€¦ cio!â€ And I like Black. I like Black, Black, Black, Bla-a-a-a-a-a-ck pussy. Iâ€™m talking fucking Black Lives Matter black. Civil Rights Movement black. Wyclef Jeanâ€™s kneecap black. Bobby Brown crack finger black. [Laughs] Wesley Snipesâ€™ everything black. And that pussy been through so much. All Black women been through so much trouble and oppression. She ainâ€™t impressed by nothing you do. You canâ€™t hurt that pussy. You pull their panties down and pussy got attitude, look at you like, â€œTsk.â€ â€œThatâ€™s all you got?â€ [Sighs deeply] Ah, it feels so good to live my truth. Thank you, baby girl, for accepting me. [Sighs] Come on. Letâ€™s go live our truth. Letâ€™s go tell your mother, huh? You first, b*tch. Iâ€™ll be over here. Iâ€™m proud. Iâ€™m so proud of her that Pride month passed, and I put a post up on my Instagram. And I wrote her a beautiful caption. I said, â€œHappy Pride Month to my pride and joy. Iâ€™m so proud of you for living your truth, for having the courage to just be you.â€ I said, â€œDaddy loves you to the moon and backâ€, around the stars, through every galaxy. And one day, when God takes me, may he bring me back again to find you exactly the way you are and love you for the rest of eternity. â€œLove always, Daddy.â€
[Applause]
But you know, on Instagram, thereâ€™s always that one comment. That one negative n*gga with a little dick. Lonely, insecure, mad he living in his mamaâ€™s basement thatâ€™s full of fucking mold. Well, this piece of shitâ€¦ Chaz0135. He writes, â€œI canâ€™t believe you would teach your daughter this.â€ I said, â€œHey, motherfucker. I didnâ€™t teach this little girl how to be gay!â€ How do you teach somebody to be gay? Tell me. What do you think I did? You think I sat her down and told her her alphabets like this? â€œListen, fuck ABC. All you need to know is LGBTQ. Thatâ€™s all!â€ I didnâ€™t teach her to be gay. Sometimes thatâ€™s just the way they are. I need yâ€™all to listen to your kids. I should have known she was gay. You know how? I remember when my daughter was born, right? My daughter was threeâ€¦ My daughter was three and a half weeks late when we gave birth to her. Three and a half weeks. We had to induce labor. We used Pitocin to get her out. Her mother was in labor for 42 hours, trying to push this little girl out. So obviously, this little b*tch loved pussy! But see, I wasnâ€™t listening. So I look at guys like Chaz0135, and I go, â€œListen, sometimes thatâ€™s just the way the child comes. And how dare you try to shame a young lady thatâ€™s just trying to find her way in the world.â€ That shit pissed me off. Iâ€™m a troll, I went to that motherfuckerâ€™s profile, I started lookingâ€¦ Thinking of jokes. Oh, I called my brothers. Yes, I called for backup. I said, â€œShawn, Keenen, Damon. Instagram. Chaz0135. Koo-koo!â€
[Applause]
Oh, we a family full of n*ggas. They hit me back with the â€œSoo!â€ Yeah, and I was starting toâ€¦ Like, we about to light him up with jokes, but then I saw that Chaz0135 had a brand-new baby girl. And so I seen where his insecurity was coming from. So I instantly called my boys off, called the boys off, was likeâ€¦ [makes bird sound] Oh, thatâ€™s bird talk for â€œBack up, back up, back up.â€ And they hit me back with theâ€¦[makes bird sound] Thatâ€™s, â€œAlright, n*gga, you good, you good, you good.â€ [Chuckles] Because I know someâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna tell you something. Iâ€™m aâ€¦ Iâ€™m a man of God. â€œNo weapon formed against me shall prosper.â€ Yes. I saw the same Tyler Perry movie as you, sister, same one. Because you realize something, that thereâ€™s a karma to life. You ainâ€™t gotta do nothing to bad people. Let me tell you something, Chaz0135. One day when your baby girl grows up, and she turns 19, and she comes out the closet. Iâ€™m gonna have my daughter fuck her! â€˜Cause Iâ€™m a motherfucking troll like that. [Laughter] Guess what? I got gay friends. You should see the looks that I get from people when I hang out with my gay friends. Even my straight guy friends be looking at me when I hang out with my gay guy friends. They be looking at me like, â€œOh, hey, watch out, bro. Watch out.â€ â€œWatch out for what? This shit ainâ€™t contagious. This shit ainâ€™t COVID. Like, you canâ€™t catch gay, n*gga, likeâ€¦â€ You acting like I hang out with my gay friends and I catch gay and I show up the next day and Iâ€™m just coughing up dick. â€œHey, Marlon, how you doing?â€ â€œI donâ€™t feel so good!â€ â€œWhat happened to you?â€ â€œOh, I hung out with Aubrey, and he sneezed on me, and I just been coughing up dick all day!â€ [Sneezes] â€œOh, I keep this up, I think Iâ€™m gonna have to call in dick to work. This getting crazy.â€ No, canâ€™t catch gay. And Iâ€™m glad I got my gay friends. â€˜Cause thatâ€™s who I consulted with when it was time for me to figure out my daughter. I sat my gay buddy down, I said, â€œHey, bro,â€ I said, â€œLet me ask you ask you a question.â€ I said, â€œWhen did you know you were gay?â€ He looked at me, he said, [Effeminate voice] â€œWellâ€¦â€ [Normal voice] Heâ€¦ he did. He gotâ€¦ he got noodley on me. He said, [Effeminate voice] â€œWellâ€¦â€ [Normal voice] And he made this little noise. He went [clicks tongue] I said, â€œWhat the fuck? What was that noise? You just pull off an imaginary penis to answer my question?â€ [Laughs] You know, me and my friend, we continued to talk. He asked, â€œWhat are you gonna do?â€ And I said, â€œIâ€™m gonna accept her.â€ And he said, â€œThatâ€™s the only thing you can do. I wasnâ€™t so lucky. I havenâ€™t spoken to my father since the day I came out.â€ And that shit fucked me up, man. That shit had me thinking. I was like, â€œDamn. What if it was my son that was gay?â€ Like, what would that prom night be like? Letâ€™s go on a little journey. [Chuckles] Doorbell rings. â€œBoom-boom.â€ I get all excited. Yeah, letâ€™s see what he working with! [Laughs] [Screams] Unh-unh. What in the fuck? Aw. This n*gga. â€œShawn, come downstairs, your dick is here.â€ I mean, your date is here! Yeah, thereâ€™s weed in the glove box. Roll me a blunt, please. Shit, I need one. Uh, also, guys, I-I got you some, uh, liquor. I got liquor. I got Ciroc in there. Yeah, yeah, you can drink the Ciroc. But also I got you some Hennessy. You may wanna pour the brown liquor on your booty hole and just numb it up a little â€œbefore you do what youâ€™re gonna do.â€ And I be like, â€œHere, here, hey, guys, here. Take the Molly. Take the Molly. Wait, howâ€¦ how tall are you? 6â€™4â€? Oh, Goddamn, here take five. May be a little easier for you to take that dick â€œif youâ€™re a little bit high.â€ Likeâ€¦[groans] But then I would take a beat, and I would think to myself that on the other side of my fear is my son. My child that God gave me, the boy that I raised. And no child deserves to go unloved or unsupported because of their sexuality.
[Applause]
This is a real issue for fathers, especially in the Black community. So yes, I will call my gay son back. Iâ€™ll be like, â€œCome here, n*gga. Come here. Come here. Just him please. Thanks, Sasquatch.â€ Iâ€™ll be like, â€œLook, Iâ€™m sorry, okay? Iâ€™m sorry.â€ Itâ€™s just that, you know, this whole gay thing just crept up on me from behind. Not behind like, â€˜Oh!â€™ You know what I mean? You know, itâ€™s just that, you know, Iâ€™m just having a hard time trying to swallow it. Not swallow it like [gagging] Okay, itâ€™s just that, when you was little, I-I-I was like, â€˜Hey, I got a son, and we gonna play ball together! Yay!â€™ And I didnâ€™t know you wanted to play with dudes, so thatâ€™s kinda fucking me up. But let me ask you something. Are you happy? No, are you really happy? And this is your life? Then fuck it, Iâ€™m happy for you. And I accept you. Youâ€™re my son. Come here, boy, I love you. Iâ€™m proud of you. Come here. Give me a hug, come here. Put your arms around me. Stop being gay. Put your arms around me. I love you, boy. [Smooches] Alright. Go ahead, n*gga, go enjoy your prom night. â€œYeah, you look pretty in your dress, okay?â€ Just do me a favor. For your dad. From n*ggaâ€¦ to n*ggette. Just donâ€™t be no b*tch-ass n*gga. You fuck that n*gga in his ass. Yeah! You give him the Wayans stroke! Yeah, boy! Yeah! Yeah, boy! Yeah, boy! Yeah! [Speaks indistinctly] I got a son. He ainâ€™t gay, but heâ€™s an asshole. I donâ€™t know what happens to kids when they become teenagers. They just turn into dickheads. My sonâ€™s a dickhead. Like, you know, when he was little, when he was 4 years old, that boy worshipped the ground I walked on. I couldnâ€™t go anywhere without him following me around or crying. I would leave the house for one minute, this boy would lose his mind. [Crying] â€œI want my daddy! I want my daddy! I want my daddy! No, get off me, Mom! I donâ€™t want you, I want Dad!â€ [Normal voice] And Iâ€™d come back in the house, Iâ€™d be like, â€œHey, son! Iâ€™m home!â€ Heâ€™d go, â€œDad!â€ and he would run to me, and heâ€™d grab my leg and go, â€œDad, you my best friend. Donâ€™t ever leave again. Donâ€™t ever leave again.â€ And Iâ€™d say, â€œAw, there, there, little n*gga. [Chuckles] I just went to the store, man. Get the fuck up off me.â€ Thatâ€™s when my son was 4 years old. My son is 18 years old now. Boy, does times change. I was gone for three and a half months. Three and a half months. I would call my son. Shit go right to voicemail. So I text his little ass. He didnâ€™t text me back. No bubbles, no nothing. He wasnâ€™t even attempting to hit me back. So I FaceTime his ass. Shit said â€œUnavailable.â€ Just a picture of me looking stupid likeâ€¦ So I hit him on Facebook. You know he unfriended me? So I dipped into his Instagram. This motherfucker unfollowed me. But he still follows Chaz0135. So now at this point, Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatâ€™s this dudeâ€™s problem?â€ And I started getting mad, but then I started thinking, â€œWell, maybe he just misses me, and he donâ€™t know how to express that.â€ But you know what? When I come home after three and a half months, heâ€™s gonna come running to me like he did when he was little. Heâ€™s gonna grab my leg and say, â€œDad, donâ€™t ever leave again. Donâ€™t ever leave again.â€ And, boy, was I wrong. I came in the house after three and a half months. I was so cocky. I walked in, I dropped my bags, I said, â€œSon! Daddyâ€™s home!â€ This jackass looked at me, he said, [Sniffs] â€œWhat up, n*gga?â€ And then he walked away. I said, â€œHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, n*ggaâ€, if you donâ€™t get the fuck over here and give me the proper greeting, a hug and a kiss, I swear to God, I will shove you back in my dick, â€œand I will shoot you into a sock!â€ Yeah, you better consider yourself lucky you here. Itâ€™s â€™cause of me. Itâ€™s â€™cause of my shot. â€˜Cause, boy, I coulda shot you anywhere. I coulda shot you on a wall, I coulda shot you on the ceiling. I could reach! I just gotta hold it and then, bow! I coulda shot you in the sink, right down the drain. I coulda back-handed you or shot you in your mamaâ€™s hair. I coulda shot you in her face, â€™cause your mama like that type of shit, son. And itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m upset. Itâ€™s that Iâ€™m hurt. Fatherâ€™s Day come. The one fucking day that fathers get to be loved and appreciated. My daughter, she posts a picture of me, she writes me nine measly words. â€œHappy Fatherâ€™s Day, Dad. You a good dude.â€ I said, â€œNo, little gay b*tch. You a good dude.â€ But I gotta give it to her. At least she gave me some effort. She wrote words. My son, this little dickhead, he writes me three letters. #HFD. Yâ€™all, I was so confused, I was like, â€œHouston Fire Department, what the fuck?â€ [Chuckles] It took me to Christmas to realize this jackass was saying â€œHappy Fatherâ€™s Day.â€ And I donâ€™t know what I did wrong. â€˜Cause when you parent, thereâ€™s no proper formula. But I know I left one important ingredient out. Iâ€¦ didnâ€™t spank my children. Um, all the sisters like, â€œOh, you did what?â€ Send them motherfuckers to my house. I got you, boo. Iâ€™ll beat they ass and send them right back to you. No, I woâ€¦ Iâ€™ll put cocoa butter on they little scars â€œand send them right fucking back.â€ Spankingâ€™s just some shit that we inherited from slavery. And all we doing is passing that damage down to our own children. White folks donâ€™t do that. They talk to their kids. You see little kids in the supermarket throwing shit and shitting in fucking cereal boxes andâ€¦ [Mock White voice] â€œStop that, Jimmy. Jimmy, no, thatâ€™s not nice. Youâ€™re making me anxious, Jimmy.â€ [Normal voice] Nig? Black folksâ€™ kid grab a cereal box, â€œIâ€™ll kill ya, n*gga! Bap bap!â€ We gotta stop that shit, yâ€™all. Thatâ€™s some bullshit. And I remember the day that I was at that crossroad where I was gonna spank â€“ where Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I chose not to spank my son or my kids. So, my son was 4 years old, and he had one of his buddies over at the house. Little badass kid. Little n*gga, name was like Tyrese or Tyrell. I think anything with a â€œTyâ€ in itâ€¦ Tyrese, Tyrell, Ty-Ty, Tyrone, he gonna spend time in juvie at some point in his life. He a bad little n*gga. He had the cornrows, little tattoo on his neck and shit. And my son, they wereâ€¦ He playingâ€¦ They were playing ball in the house. Boppity-boppity-boppity-bah. And you know, my childrenâ€™s mother, she got all upset. She started nagging. â€œShawn, stop playing ball in the house!â€ And you know kids, they donâ€™t listen to their mother. Like, â€œYeah, whatever, b*tch.â€ Boppity-boppity-boppity-bah. So she calls me in. â€œMarlon, I told Shawn to stop playing ball in the house and he ainâ€™t listening!â€ So, you know, I hit him with the daddy voice. I said, [Deep voice] â€œHey, hey, hey!â€ [Normal voice] Every n*gga with a father justâ€¦ Thatâ€™s what my son did. I said, [Deep voice] â€œHey, hey, hey! Your mama says stop playing ball in the house, you stop playing ball in the house, you understand me?â€ [Normal voice] My son said, â€œOkay.â€ And then Tyrese, this little fatherless motherfucker. I say that â€™cause he was immune to daddy voice. So I squeezed one of my balls to get the ballâ€¦ To get the voice a little deeper. I said, [Deeper voice] â€œHey, n*gga, I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m your daddy or not, you better stop playing ball in the Goddamn house before I kick your little ass.â€ [Normal voice] He said, â€œMan, you ainâ€™t my daddy.â€ I said, â€œI see why your daddy left you, you little piece of shit.â€ And so heâ€™s still dribbling the ball. I told my son, â€œHey, you better not play.â€ He can do what the fuck he want, but you? You better listen to me.â€ My son said, â€œOkay.â€ So Tyrese is dribbling the ball. Bobbity-bobbity-bobbity-bop. Bobbity-bop. He crossing over. Bobbity-bop. Bobbity-bop. Through the legs. Bop-bop-bop. And he doing behind-the-back drills. Bop-bop. He playing ball so good, this shit looked fun. I want the n*gga to pass me the ball. So, at a point, my son looking at Tyrese, and heâ€™s all impressed, and then he look at me. And heâ€™d look back at Tyrese dribbling the ball. And heâ€™d look at me. And heâ€™d look at Tyrese dribbling the ball, and heâ€™d look at Tyrese, heâ€™d go, â€œHey, Tyrese! Pass me the ball!â€ Man, I got so mad, I forgot my son was my son. Matter of fact, I forgot he was a kid, period. I talked to him like he was a grown-ass man. I said, â€œMan, are you out your motherfucking mind!â€ You know who the fuck I am, n*gga? You donâ€™t know me, n*gga! Oh, fuck, Iâ€™ll fuck you up, boy! Iâ€™ll fuck you up! You donâ€™t know me! You donâ€™t know me, n*gga! My mama donâ€™t know me, and I came out of her. You know who you fucking with? â€œIâ€™ll fucking chuck your little ass!â€ And his mother ran to him, she said, â€œMarlon, what you doing?â€ I said, â€œB*tch, this your fault!â€ She said, â€œPut him down.â€ So I put his little ass down. She said, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with you?â€ I said, â€œI donâ€™t know!â€ So she grabbed me, brought me to the bathroom. And I came out the door, said, â€œIâ€™ma fuck you up, Shawn! And Tyrese, Iâ€™m fucking you up, too!â€ And thatâ€™s when Tyrese pulled out his knife, he said, â€œYeah, n*gga, come on with it. Come on with it.â€ So Angela grabs me into the bathroom. And at this point, Iâ€™m fucking crying and Iâ€™m shaking. And sheâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with you?â€ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t fucking know!â€ And I look in the mirror. And then my face morphs to me as a little boy. And I started thinking about all the ass-whoopings that my father gave me. And I started thinking about how much those ass-whoopings hurt. Not just my heart, but my ass. And I started thinking that every time my father hit me, it only made me further away from him. It made me distant from my father. I love my father now as a man, but as a kid, I didnâ€™t love him. I feared him. Every time my father called my nameâ€¦ â€œMarlon!â€ Yo, my heart would beat fast, Iâ€™d piss my leg a little bit. My leg would get itchy, my ass would get small. My booty hole get nervous. Booty hole be looking over. [Silly voice] Oh, shit, you in trouble now. [Normal voice] And it got to the point where sometimes it wasnâ€™t even for a spanking. For good shit, Iâ€™d get scared! â€œMarlon!â€ Ha! [Sobs] â€œHere, take this, go get some ice cream.â€ â€œOh, my God, what kind of fucking mind trick is this?â€ Because what parents donâ€™t realize, especially a father, you are your childâ€™s superhero. So every time you hit your kid, itâ€™s like Spider-Man made a web that was a belt and whooped his little ass. Like Superman took off his cape and made one of them little towels that you hit n*ggas in the ass in the locker room. Sh-pap! Sh-pap! Thatâ€™s what it feels like! And so I chose not to hit my son. Instead, I sent him to bed. I said, â€œGo to bed! And donâ€™t eat! Ever! N*gga, you better not ever eat again!â€ So 4:00 in the morning, I woke his little ass up. I said, â€œShawn!â€ He got up all scared. I could hear his heartbeat. Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. I could see a little pee dribbling down his leg. His little ass got tight. His little booty hole started talking to me. [Silly voice] Oh, shit, you in trouble now! [Normal voice] And my boy started crying, he said, â€œYou gonna spank me? You just gonna spank me, Dad? You gonna spank me? I donâ€™t care, you can spank me! I donâ€™t care! You can spank me!â€ I said, â€œI ainâ€™t gonna spank you.â€ Said, â€œIâ€™ma talk to you.â€ And I sat him down. I said, â€œLet me tell you something. What you did yesterdayâ€¦â€ I said, â€œYou hurt my feelings.â€ And my son started crying, he said, â€œOh, God, Dad. Donâ€™t say that. I didnâ€™t mean to hurt your feelings, Dad.â€ I said, â€œYou broke the trust.â€ He said, â€œOh, God, no!â€ Say it ainâ€™t so! Say it ainâ€™t so! [Sobs] I didnâ€™t mean to break the trust, Dad. Not the trust! Whatâ€™s trust? How much is it? â€œCan Mom buy some more trust on Amazon?â€ I said, â€œYou disappointed me.â€ He said, â€œOh, Dad, I didnâ€™t mean [sobs] to ussapointâ€¦ you!â€ And I said to myself, â€œOh, shit. White power words work!â€ So I started hitting him with all kind of White power words. I said, â€œYes, and furthermore!â€ â€œNo, Dad, donâ€™t go no further!â€ â€œIâ€¦ Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m appalled.â€ â€œNo, Dad, donâ€™t call Paul!â€ â€œAnd Iâ€™m exacerbated by your action!â€ â€œOh, Dad, donâ€™t masturbate on the actions!â€ I said, â€œSo why would you listen to Tyrese over me?â€ He said, â€œI donâ€™t know, Dad.â€ He said, â€œShit, â€™cause I was scared, Dad! I was scared!â€ I said, â€œWhy? Of what?â€ He says, â€œOf Tyrese.â€ I said, â€œWhy?â€ He said, â€œDad, he got a outie belly button!â€ [Laughter] And you know whatâ€™s funny, man? Is I wanna blame my kids for our relationship, but that would be wrong of me, and thatâ€™d be immature. As a man, I gotta blame myself. I fucked up. Somewhere along the line, I fucked up. And Iâ€™ve been trying to trace my steps, like, â€œWhat did I do?â€ Did I spoil them? I knew I shouldnâ€™t have never told them n*ggas I had money. I should have raised them in the projects. â€œThey need more government cheese in their life.â€ [Chuckles] Or was it because I got caught cheating on their mother on a boat in St. Bartâ€™s? I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s it. I think it was spoiling them, I definitely think. I fucked up, man. I did. And Iâ€™ll tell yâ€™all a story. Fuck it, you know? What had happened wasâ€¦ [Laughs] Thatâ€™s how you know it was bad, when you, â€œWell, what had happened wasâ€¦â€ Alright, uh, shit. Alright. Real talk.
Alright, so years back, I did a movie called A Haunted House. And, yeah, it was really successful. Like this shit, I made it for a million dollars. It made like $100 million dollars worldwide. I made so much money, I felt like Jay-Z. I was like, â€œYo, Iâ€™m going somewhere hot where thereâ€™s no mosquitos! Yeah!â€ I was like, â€œYo, Iâ€™m going to St. Bartâ€™s.â€ Iâ€™ma rent a yacht!â€ But see, Jay-Z is so smart, I see why this n*ggaâ€™s a billionaire. â€˜Cause Jay-Z, he brings BeyoncÃ© and them babies to St. Bartâ€™s with him. Yeah, see, me, I fucked up. I brought a n*gga named Steve. Iâ€™m out in St. Bartâ€™s, right? And Iâ€™m in the middle of the ocean. I donâ€™t even know how paparazzi got my picture. We was in the middle of the fucking ocean with some girls on the boat. And I swear, paparazzi is sneaky. I was like, â€œWhere the fuck were they?â€ Were they in a fucking dolphin, justâ€¦[Imitating dolphin] [Imitating camera shutter clicking] I didnâ€™t know where they was! And so, I didnâ€™t know until I got back to my hotel. I get back to my hotel, Iâ€™m feeling myself, got my shirt off, got the Coppertone tan. Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, we did that, Steve! Yeah, we did that.â€ And then my phone buzzed. [Makes buzzing sound] What the fuck is that? So I picked up the phone, and see, I put Google alerts on myself, â€™cause as yâ€™all see from this set, I say a lot of stupid shit, so I need to know the stupid shit I say, so I can call my publicist, so she can put the stupid shit I say, and say it was a lie, when it probably was the truth. [Laughs] I pick it up. â€œParis Mail.â€ [French accent] â€œMarlon Wayans caught on the boat kissing the beautiful mademoiselle, or was this a mistress in St. Bartâ€™s? Uh-oh!â€ [Normal voice] I put that phone down. I was like, â€œOh, fuck! Fuck!â€ I was like, â€œShit!â€ I was like, â€œOkay, Angie donâ€™t know shit about France.â€ Okay, she donâ€™t know shit about French at all. She calls Gucci â€˜Gucky.â€™ She donâ€™t know shit! She still think I bought her a â€˜Channelâ€™ bag for Christmas. Alright, so maybe Iâ€™ll go by the Louis â€˜Voottonâ€™ store and buy her a bag â€œjust in case she does find out.â€ But I was like, â€œAlright, relax, relax. She donâ€™t know no publications out the country. Thatâ€™s some White shit.â€ So I put my phone down. Motherfucker buzzed again. [Makes buzzing noise] I pick it up. N*gga. â€œBossip.â€ â€œMedia Take Out.â€ â€œShade Room.â€ â€œEssenceâ€ magazine. â€œEbonyâ€ magazine. Everybody had the same title. â€œMarlon Wayans caught on boat in St. Bartâ€™s, cheating on his childrenâ€™s mother with a White b*tch!â€ [Chuckles] And I donâ€™t know if yâ€™all know Black culture, but look, itâ€™s one thing to fuck aâ€¦ fuck around, but you fuck around with White girls, sisters donâ€™t like that shit too much. Thatâ€™s why we be lying. N*ggas be like, â€œOh, she wasnâ€™tâ€¦ she wasnâ€™t White. She was mixed. Yeah, she was Swedish and Irish and German, but she wasnâ€™t White, you know what I mean?â€
And sisters, you should have seen the articles. They was lighting me up. They was like, â€œI canâ€™t believe this funny-looking n*gga had the nerve to cheat. I could see if it was Shawn, but not this bird-looking n*gga. He look like a ostrich that fell in some fucking oil. I can see if it was Damon, at least heâ€™s funny. I wanna sit on his smushed-up face. But Marlon? He got some fucking nerve. Him and Nick Cannon need to go crawl â€œunder the same rock and die.â€ I was like, â€œOh, shit!â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œI canâ€™t believe he got caught cheating with a White b*tch,â€ and Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, sisters, if she was Black, would yâ€™all be happier about that?â€ Like you pick up the thing and you see, â€œOh, my God, I canâ€™t believe Marlon Wayans got caught cheating. [Gasps] With a Black b*tch! Thatâ€™s why I fucks with Marlon. I always like Marlon the best! â€œI did. He got big dick swag.â€ And so now, I start getting the phone calls. Paparazzi took so many pictures of me, my brothers find out shit about me they didnâ€™t know I did. Phone rings. Keenen. [As Keenen] â€œNow, whatâ€™s up, little boy? How you doing? Mm, looks like youâ€™re having a bad day. And when did you learn how to scuba dive?â€ [Normal voice] Hang up on him. Shawn. [As Shawn] â€œHey, stupid! What are you doing, stupid?â€ What are you doing in the fucking ocean? You fucking drowned in a bathtub when we was fucking 8 years old, you fucking stupid. When did you learn how to Jet Ski? You crashed your fucking Big Wheel three times. â€œWhy would you get a fucking Jet Ski, stupid?â€ [Normal voice] He hangs up the phone. Damon. [As Damon] â€œHey, ugly, how you doing?â€ Mm. Iâ€™m doing better than you, thatâ€™s for sure. Hey, let me ask you something. When did you learn how to snorkel? â€œMm-mm-mm.â€ [Normal voice] So then my childrenâ€™s mother. [As Angieâ€™s] â€œYou stupid motherfucker. I canâ€™t believe you got caught cheating! Canâ€™t you be more discreet?â€ [Normal voice] I said, â€œBabyâ€, I was in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, 8,500 miles away. You gotta know the latitude and longitude of my dick â€œto catch me.â€ â€œWell, they caught your stupid ass. And look at you looking all stupid.â€ Women are funny. â€˜Cause it wasnâ€™t the kiss that she was mad about. She found the little shit. I said, â€œI know, I canâ€™t believe I was sitting there kissing that girl, Iâ€™m soâ€¦ I know itâ€™s so embarrassing.â€ She said, â€œI donâ€™t give a fuck about that little, pastyâ€, little b*tch with her little, thin-ass bologna lips, that scraggly-looking b*tch. Look at your stupid foot. Look at your stupid little foot. Look at that shit all pigeon-toed, bird foot motherfucker, looking like a old sonâ€¦ A fucking parrot twisted his ankle. Look how stupid your fucking foot look up in the air, â€œlooking all stupid.â€ [Chuckles] She had me looking like, â€œOh, shit, I am pigeon-toed. Ainâ€™t that a b*tch.â€ And she goes, â€œI canâ€™t believe you got caught cheating with a White b*tch!â€ I said, â€œAng, she wasnâ€™t White. She was mixed. She was Swedish and Irish and German, andâ€¦ and I think she might have had been a little bit Nazi, but she wasnâ€™t White, like, youâ€™re tripping.â€ She hangs up the phone. Then my buddy Steve, he comes to the rescue. [As Steve] â€œMarlon, listen.â€ [Scoffs] All she got was pictures. Pictures are worth a thousand words. All you have to do is corroborate a story. We donâ€™t know what happened in that picture. So hereâ€™s the story weâ€™re gonna tell. We went in the middle of the ocean, andâ€¦ andâ€¦ and we went in a yacht, â€œand we saw some mermaids.â€ â€œAnd the mermaids was drowning.â€ Bloop-bloop-bloop. Bloop-bloop-bloop. And you, being the good Samaritan that you are, you jumped overboard, being a hero. You grabbed the mermaid to safety, and you brought her on board. And you wasnâ€™t kissing her! No. No, no, no. â€œYou was giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.â€ [Normal voice] I said, â€œN*gga, if you donâ€™t get the fuck awayâ€ from me, I swear to God, I will wrap this anchor around your neck and put you in the bottom of this fucking ocean, â€œso help me God.â€ So now, I gotta go home, and I gotta face the music. And see, that day was the worst day of my life. Thatâ€™s some shit that Iâ€™m gonna regret till my dying day. Iâ€™m gonna be in the coffin. They gonna close the lid, Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m sorry about the boat!â€ Because itâ€™s one thing to break your womanâ€™s heart. Itâ€™s another thing to break your kidâ€™s heart. And I remember, I went to her house. I stop at my house, and I grab my Bible. Yeah, â€™cause itâ€™s really hard to throw hot grits on a n*gga holding a Bible. And I walk up to the door, and I knock on the door. And she sees me holding the Bible, I said, â€œBible study, my sister.â€ And she starts to laugh, because, you know, Iâ€¦ Thatâ€™s the thing that she fell in love with. The fact that I have humor. I ainâ€™t cute, so itâ€™s definitely the humor. And she was like, â€œDonâ€™t make me laugh.â€ Donâ€™tâ€¦ I fucking hate you. Donâ€™t make meâ€¦ Is that really a Biblâ€¦ Fuck it, I hate you. Donâ€™t make me laugh!â€ And she hit me. I said, â€œUm, sister, it says â€˜Thou shalt not kill.'â€ And she said, â€œYeah, and it also says, â€˜Thou shalt not fuck White b*tches in St. Bartâ€™s.'â€ I said, â€œShe wasnâ€™t White. She was mixed.â€ [Laughs] And sheâ€™s like, â€œGet your ass in there.â€ And then [chuckles] she goes, â€œGo ahead. Talk to your kids.â€ I said, â€œTalk to the kids?â€ â€œYeah, tell them what you did.â€ â€œTell them what you did?â€ Fuck it. You got a page out the book â€œThe Mackâ€? What the fuck? Stick yourself, Tony. Stick yourself. So she said, â€œNo, talk to them.â€ I look at the table, and my kids are sitting at the table. My son, he looked likeâ€¦ Heâ€™s so sad, he looks like his pet turtle died. And my daughter, sheâ€™s sitting there holding her little naked dollies, just [humming] I said, â€œHey, kids, how you doing?â€ Um, remember when Daddy said he wasnâ€™t perfect? Well, thereâ€™s something on the Internet that proves that theory, so whatever you do, â€œdonâ€™t Google my name.â€ My daughter said, â€œToo late, Dad. Hmm. Canâ€™t believe you got caught cheating on Mom. [Chuckles] With a White b*tch.â€ I said, â€œShe wasnâ€™t White. She was mixed! She was Swedish and Irish and German, and a little bit Aryan, but I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t think she was White.â€ And she goes, â€œDonâ€™t worry, Dad. I accept you.â€ I said, â€œYou do?â€ I said, â€œYou forgive me?â€ She goes, â€œYeah, I forgive you. And I accept you. But, you know, thereâ€™s gonna be some things youâ€™re gonna have to accept about me, too, later on in life.â€ And she took her two little white dollies and put they pussies together. And I was like, â€œOkay.â€ And so, I said to my son, I said, â€œSon, do you forgive me?â€ He said, â€œYeah, I forgive you, Dad.â€ But Iâ€™m really ussapointed. And furthermore, I think you should call Paul. And I need you to really masturbate on your actions, â€œâ€™cause shâ€¦â€ And I said, â€œI think I know what you mean. Iâ€™m sorry.â€ I said, â€œI love you, and Iâ€™ma make it up to you guys.â€ I promise. If I gotta spend the rest of my life making it up to you, I will. â€œAnd I love you.â€ And I gave them both kisses. [Smooches] And they said, â€œOkay.â€ And I went to walk off, and I was like, â€œOh, thank God.â€ And my son said, â€œHey, Dad?â€ I said, â€œHuh?â€ Said, â€œI got a few more questions.â€ I said, â€œYou do? Okay, shoot, Tiger, whatâ€¦ What you got? You wanna know the weather in St. Bartâ€™s? Itâ€™s hot, humid, you know, no mosquitos. Itâ€™s cool.â€ He said, â€œMnh-mnh.â€ He said, â€œHow many girls was on the boat?â€ Where did you meet these girls? How did they get there? Did you know them all? That one you was kissing, how do you know her? Where do you know her from? Did you fly her in? Did she fly first class? Did she fly coach? Or was she Delta Comfort? Whatâ€™s this girlâ€™s Instagram? â€œWhatâ€™s her number? Do you love her?â€ I said, â€œHey, n*gga, where you get these fucking questions from?â€ And I look over at his mother, who got a whole list of questions, and sheâ€™s checking them off. â€œMm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And donâ€™t forget to ask if he wore a condom.â€ I said, â€œYou wanna know the truth?â€ Fuck it. You wanna know the truth? Iâ€™ma tell you the fucking truth. Hereâ€™s the truth. The movie was very successful. I made a lot of fucking money, and I wanted to go somewhere hot where there was no mosquitos, so I went to St. Bartâ€™s. And me and my boy rented a boat, and we went out to the middle of the ocean. And we saw some mermaids, â€œand they were drowning.â€ [Laughs] No, but reâ€¦ [chuckles] real talk? You know, you gotta understand, fame is hard, man. Iâ€™ve been doing this shit for 30 years. And temptation is fucking real, man. Like, I could say â€œNoâ€ to a thousand girls. But, man, a thousand and one, sometimes they come with a thousand and two. And then they bring a thousand and three and four andâ€¦
[Deep voice] You know what it is.
[Normal voice] I love yâ€™all, I thank yâ€™all. Good night!

Iâ€™m Kyle Kinane. Kyle Christian Kinane. Yeah, these are my jokes. Theyâ€™re not real funny on a paper. Get me pretty. I just feel like a little princess. Send them back. This is Kyle. Heâ€™s gonna tell jokes. ** Howâ€™s it going, San Francisco? Yeah. Man. Thank you for coming. San Franciscoâ€¦ one city where you can ask, â€œAre we in a dog-friendly lesbian bar or a lesbian-friendly dog bar?â€ Doesnâ€™t matter, itâ€™s San Francisco. Have a good time. I know you got a lot of choices of what to do with your free time. Thanks for coming to see Uncle Barbecue tell us dum-dum stories for a little while. Heâ€™s gonna spin a couple yarns and weâ€™ll all get on to our fun, carefree lifestyles. I think a lot of comedy comes from shared experiences, things that we can relate to. Keeping that in mind, anybody else in here get so drunk last month you had to call a cab just to take you to Wendyâ€™s?
Yes!
Just a couple? All right. Maybe a couple? Right there. Yeah. Get to that special point in your mid-30s where you realize that drinking responsibly and crying for help just kind of turned into the same thing. A real successful Saturday night home alone, â€œI want those spicy nuggets! â€œYouâ€™re too drunk to drive. â€œWell call a cab, â€™cause you deserve â€™em. Iâ€™m doing the right thing. How come it still feels sad?â€ Thatâ€™s what I did. I called a cab, and another grown man drove to my house, for money, because that was his job. And he got to my house and I jumped in his cab, and I said this. Donâ€™t do what I did when you get a cab. I just jumped in and I just said, â€œWeâ€™re going on an adventure!â€ Thatâ€™s just $80 on the meter right away. They donâ€™t want to be a tour guide. Thatâ€™s 80 bucks. Thatâ€™s the Peter Pan tax, is what that is. Thatâ€™s the same amount of money if I were to just jump in and be like, â€œTake me to Neverland!â€ â€œ80 bucks. You smell like youâ€™re probably gonna barf in here, â€œso weâ€™re starting at 80. Doesnâ€™t matter where youâ€™re going.â€
And so we drove to the Wendyâ€™s and I made him take me through the drive-thru because I did not trust him not to leave me there. It was fair. He was suspicious of me. I was suspicious of him. It was fair play. But this is where I got in trouble, see, is â€™cause he was driving a van cab, which means I had to open the whole side door to place my order. I was like, â€œWell thereâ€™s no way in hell Iâ€™m not gonna fall on my ass doing this.â€ So I had one hand wrapped up in the seatbelt. I was just kind of hanging out the side like a helicopter machine gunner. I was just kind of hanging out. I realized like, â€œThis is how they do â€œthe high-speed ransom exchanges â€œin the action movies I love so much. Iâ€™m gonna Bruce Willis the shit out of this.â€ So I wasnâ€™t even at the window, I was just hanging out. I was like, â€œYou throw me the nuggets, Iâ€™ll throw you the cash!â€ And the lady working there, she threw me the little bag. Sheâ€™s gotta cut loose. Sheâ€™s working late at a Wendyâ€™s, Have some fun with your life. Have some fun with it. So I got the stuff, Iâ€™m yelling at the getaway driverâ€¦ At this point, itâ€™s the â€œgetaway driver.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œI got the package, step on it! Go!â€ But heâ€™s not in it. Heâ€™s like, â€œI cannot go if the door is open. â€œI cannot drive if the door is open. â€œIt is illeâ€¦ Itâ€™s an illegal thing for me to do with the door open.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBut weâ€™re doing a whole thing right now. Whereâ€™s your imagination?â€ But somebody clearly had not taken improv classes in college like some other of us have. â€œYou are not â€˜Yes Andâ€™-ing right now.â€ â€œThis other Frosty was gonna be for you, yeah. But you blew it, yeah.â€
Spent $114.00. Two Frostys and a dozen nuggetsâ€¦ â€™cause Iâ€™m an American hero. Right now, theyâ€™re losing their shit â€™cause I spilled on my shirt, and thereâ€™s somebody like, â€œItâ€™s not gonna match! Itâ€™s not gonna match! â€œWhat do we do? Itâ€™s not gonna match. Why didnâ€™t you buy two shirts, Kyle?â€ I barely need this one. â€œYou got something that will make me look like a sassy janitor?â€ Thatâ€™s myâ€¦ my fashion sense is just the wise, high school janitor. â€œI think I know a thing or two about love, young man. â€œCome sit in the closet with me. Iâ€™ll tell you all about it. Fuck it, weâ€™re going for it. I shouldnâ€™t even be alive. I know, you look at my life on paper, youâ€™re like, â€œThis is an obituary. This guyâ€™sâ€¦â€ Like, â€œYou should cherish life. Every day as a gift!â€ Yeah, keep the receipt on some of those. Iâ€™m gonna return some of those for store credit. I donâ€™tâ€¦ like, at least three times a week, I will microwave food, grab it with my hands, think,â€ This is burning my flesh!â€ And then immediately think, â€œWell, then quick, put it in your mouth!â€ Thatâ€™s not a blueprint for survival. Thatâ€™s not how you stick around. I just eatâ€¦ I eat garbage. I eat the same way Doc Brown fuels the DeLorean at the end of Back to the Future. â€œDid somebody hit a trash can with a time machine?â€ â€œWhat? Iâ€™m making lunch. What are you talking about? â€œWhat? â€œVitamins? Where weâ€™re going, we donâ€™t need vitamins.â€ Iâ€™ll eat, like, a big bowl of pho and follow it up with sugar-free Red Bull â€™cause I donâ€™t care about myself. For those of youâ€¦ If you donâ€™t know what pho is, itâ€™s a Vietnamese soup that answers the question, â€œWhat happens when a former child soldier pours hot rainwater over fish nightmares?â€ Itâ€™s delicious and I canâ€™t stop eating it.
Thatâ€™s what happens. Thatâ€™s what happens. And for those of you that know what it is, you think Iâ€™m saying it wrong. Itâ€™s spelled P-H-O and people are like, â€œItâ€™s pronounced â€˜fuh,'â€ and they get all upset. â€œItâ€™s pronounced â€˜fuh.'â€ I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m already eating it. What more do you want from me? Iâ€™m guaranteeing thereâ€™s nobody in Saigon right now going, â€œItâ€™s pronounced â€œmeatball sandwich,â€™ donâ€™t be culturally insensitive.â€ So Iâ€™m going to continue to support the Vietnamese community by eating pho all the time instead of just correcting peopleâ€™s pronunciation of it. You think about that when you crash your fixed-gear bicycle on the way home. â€œItâ€™s a fixed-gear. You canâ€™t stop pedaling.â€ Sounds broken to me, dumb-ass. I rally against hipsters. I shouldnâ€™t. Ifâ€¦ If youâ€™re a hipâ€¦ Thatâ€™s fine. Be a hipster. Itâ€™s okay. Youâ€™re 22. Youâ€™re supposed to be an asshole. Just donâ€™t get so embedded in it that you become, like, hipster Serpico. That you donâ€™t knowâ€¦ Then all of a sudden, youâ€™re 26, you got, like, a Golden Girls neck tattoo and youâ€™re on a unicycle. And somebodyâ€™s like, â€œWhat do you really like?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œI donâ€™t even know anymore!â€ You know, donâ€™tâ€¦ Donâ€™t become so entrenched that you forgot that youâ€™re a human being in 2012. None of thatâ€™s gonna go on the special. I just got pissed because people were making fun of how I said â€œpho.â€ Iâ€™ve learned that optimism and stupidity are two sides of the same coin. I learned that one trying to change my pants without taking my shoes off. Too many mornings go like that. â€œJust make the ballerina toes, Kyle. â€œMake the ballerina toes. â€œYou gotâ€¦ youâ€™re gonna shave a good 30 seconds off â€œyour getting-ready time. Make the ballerina toes.â€ Didnâ€™t work. Cramped up. Cramped up. Spent 20 minutes jammed up in a pair of jeans. â€œYouâ€™re wearing slip-ons, stupid. You could have figured this one out.â€ Iâ€™ll double-check scratch-off tickets I find on the sidewalk, â€™cause I think anybody that plays scratch-off tickets is stupid. Stupid enough to discard a winning ticket. â€œYou fools are throwing your money away. â€œOoh, hold on, whatâ€™s here? Free ticket? Thatâ€™s like a dollar gift certificate for hope.â€ I thought I had it all figured out for a while there, then I was delivered an unsliced pizza.
Boo!
Everything you believe in just unravels. Everything you hold true. To some people, it sounds like a simple mistake. Not me. I took it personally. I was like, thatâ€™s somebody down at Dominos making a judgment call on my life. Thatâ€™s somebody seeing my name come up on one too many tickets and finally just being like, â€œListen, manâ€¦ â€œwe know that youâ€™re probably gonna eat this by yourself. â€œMore than likely, all in one sitting too, soâ€¦ â€œYou know what to do, man. Just fold it in half andâ€¦ bon appetit.â€ Just â€™cause they were right, I didnâ€™t appreciate the assumption. â€œYou donâ€™t know me, Dominos!â€ Plumph! â€œThis giant taco tastes like Italy!â€ Iâ€™m trying to be more tolerant, you know? Iâ€™m tryingâ€¦ Thereâ€™s too manyâ€¦ Everybodyâ€™s got their own thing going on. Itâ€™s a waste of time to not be open-minded at a lot of these things. Iâ€™m trying to be tolerant, but itâ€™s difficult. The tolerance, itâ€™s tested, routinely. I was on a flight going from Denver to Chicago, and halfway through my flightâ€¦ Midair, 35,000 feetâ€¦ The guy sitting next to me starts eating pancakes out of a bag. Not, like, a Ziploc bag with, like, a little seal and, like, a, â€œHey, I meant to do thisâ€ vibe. Like a bag from the store. Not a store that sold pancakes. See, Iâ€™m saying like a Foot Locker bag. You get me? Theyâ€™re just loose. Theyâ€™re just loose in there. Theyâ€™re like bingo ballsâ€¦ Just loose. And thereâ€™s nothing wrong with what he was doing, morally speaking. But you gotta realize that if you do some wackadoo shit like eat pancakes out of a shoe store bag on an airplane, youâ€™re forcing strangers around you into a world of questions they never anticipated they would ever have to ask. First off, â€œWhaâ€¦ howâ€¦ What?â€¦ â€ First off, all the questions. All of them. First off, every question. â€œWhy are youâ€¦ why? â€œHow did you get to this point in your life? Where are you going?â€ Becauseâ€¦ like, thereâ€¦ Thatâ€™s notâ€¦ How do you wind upâ€¦ If youâ€™re on an airplane youâ€™re on there with purpose. You are fighting gravity to travel through the sky to land on another part of the Earthâ€™s crust. Nobodyâ€™s, like, waking up casually like Amelia Earhart, like, â€œI think Iâ€™ll take to the skies today.â€ You have purpose. You have reason to fight nature to go somewhere else. How do you have that purpose in your life but still do it with hastily-packed hobo snacks in your midst? Thatâ€™s not how you catch a plane. Youâ€™re not like, â€œIs this one going southbound? â€œHavenâ€™t seen Grapefruit Joe in a while. Drop in, weâ€™ll share some beans.â€ Thatâ€™s not how you catch a plane. Usually, getting to an airport, thatâ€™s your number one priority in the day. â€œI donâ€™t care what happens, Iâ€™m gonna get to that airport. â€œYou can cutâ€¦ Iâ€™ll lose a hand. â€œIâ€™ll fix it when I get there. Just get me to the airport.â€ This guy, it was number four or five on his list. This guy was like, â€œI know I got a flight, but it is Tuesday, â€œand you know what happens on Tuesday. â€œSilver-dollar flappies, thatâ€™s what happens. â€œTuesday is silver-dollar flapjack day. â€œA lot of people say, â€˜Hey, â€œhow come you make the silver dollar ones?â€™ â€œI make â€™em that wayâ€¦ I donâ€™t make â€™em full size. â€œI make them smaller â€™cause I can eat more of them â€œand I can get more of a sense of accomplishment. â€œAnd so I like to do that. â€œAnd thatâ€™s a lot of batter over there, â€œbut Iâ€™ll freeze it up. I donâ€™t have to eat them all. â€œBut Iâ€™ll make them all and Iâ€™ll freeze them â€œin Ziploc bags, and when I need them, â€œIâ€™ll just have them ready. What time is it? â€œShit, I gotta go! â€œWhatâ€™s around? â€œWell, I did buy some new shoes the other day. â€œFoot Locker bag. Shovel, shovel. â€œKnot, bindle, boxcar, airport. Made it.â€ And he got on the plane. Heâ€™s on the plane, meaning we went through security. He went through an X-ray machine. His stuff went through. Pancakes got X-rayed that day. A TSA agent, somebody with a badge and responsibility. And if they were fulfilling even a fiber of their requirements of keeping the skies safe, somebody had to at least just, like, mumble something like, â€œUm, sir, Iâ€™m sâ€¦ umâ€¦ â€œis this a bag of pancakes? â€œItâ€¦ It is. â€œO-Okâ€¦ yeah. â€œYeah. â€œItâ€™s panâ€¦ pancakes, yeah. â€œWell, Iâ€™ve never dealt with it before either. â€œIâ€™m gonna say go ahead. â€œI donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know. â€œWe might get an earful for this, but right now, bon voyage, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m gonna say.â€ And when you eat pancakes out of a bag in a semi-public place, there are rules. First off, let people know what youâ€™re getting into. Make a little announcement. â€œHey, everybody, I got a bag of pancakes over here. Donâ€™t get freaked out.â€ Offer â€™em around. Donâ€™tâ€¦ you donâ€™t have to go front and back, just same row. Donâ€™t worry, nobodyâ€™s taking any. Itâ€™s just a gesture. â€œSee, they are, in fact, pancakes. â€œWould you care for some? No? I understand.â€ Then, when you go to eat themâ€¦ With your hands, â€™cause my man did not have fork and knife on his personâ€¦ You eat them one at a time. Driverâ€™s ed style, 10:00 and 2:00. You take a little nibble out of 12:00, and you hold it in your lap until youâ€™re ready for another bite. You follow those rules, go crazy. Hell, I like your style. Way to usurp inflated airport pricing. â€œNo, I got my own.â€ Good move. This fucking guyâ€¦ he starts offâ€¦ Heâ€™s just rustling around under there. Heâ€™s just rustling. You canâ€™t rustle on an airplane in this day. Itâ€™s suspicious. Heâ€™s rustling, heâ€™s kicking up odors. Now we got peopleâ€¦ â€œIs that breakfast? I smell breakfast.â€ Youâ€™re not supposed to smell food on a domestic flight. All it takes is one paranoid weirdo to be like, â€œI think hydraulic fluid smells like breakfast! Weâ€™re going down!â€ Now weâ€™re all in a panic, â€™cause you donâ€™t know what hydraulic fluid smells like. He gets the bag out, rips it open with a confidence like, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m eating all these bitches.â€ Rips it open, starts rooting around in there, doing this cotton candy thing. Rooting around, but heâ€™s not looking in the bag. Heâ€™s looking up and off into the distance with this look of glazed determination on his face. The kind of look you only see on the faces of people that are neck-deep in swamp water â€™cause theyâ€™re gonna catch a catfish with their bare hands. You know, just likeâ€¦ â€œWe gonna get â€™em!â€ Pulls his hand out, heâ€™s got two or three just in a grip, in a fist. Heâ€™s not going discreet, under the chin. Heâ€™s not going like, â€œHey, Iâ€™m sorry for this,â€ under the chin. Heâ€™s going over the top, just, like, â€™93 Jordan layup style, just, â€œHaa!â€ Dropping â€™em in, then looking around with an attitude after each bite, like, â€œSnack time, motherfuckers! Boom! Jealous much?â€ Are you shitting me? Iâ€™m a Delta Gold member. I gotta sit next to this? No syrup? You go straight to hell! â€˜Cause I donâ€™t know where youâ€™d get syrup in a situation like this. Probably another bag, seeing as how this dude operates. But even then, unwritten rules of decent society state you open up that bag of syrup, you pour it into your original bag of pancakes, and you tie it off nice and tight and shake it around for even coverage. â€˜Cause you might be making a bit of mess, but at least people are like, â€œWell, heâ€™s not gonna eat them dry like a psychopath.â€ Why is this what Iâ€™m upset about? Why are these the things that anger me? Thereâ€™s bigger problems in the world. I got a blank fortune cookie. Thatâ€™ll fuck up your whole day. You donâ€™t know what it means. Somebody with common sense would just be like, â€œMaybe the paper wasnâ€™t aligned right, it didnâ€™tâ€¦ â€ Not me, Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s Confucius himself weighing in.â€ Thatâ€™s Confucius. His advice is â€œI got nothing for you man. You are on your own.â€ Or maybe this is some Jason Bourne-type stuff. Maybe this is how they let the super spies know theyâ€™re activated. I donâ€™t know, I watch too many movies. I crack that open, Iâ€™m like, â€œI must be activated. â€œIâ€™m a super spy. â€œThat means I know all kinds of martial arts and foreign languages.â€ So I start yelling in what I assume to be Mandarin. It seems appropriate, given my surroundings. Becomes very apparent right away all I know is remedial Spanish, which at least they understand it because Iâ€™m having this outburst at a Panda Express in east L.A. Some guy behind the counter like, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with white boy? Why does he keep yelling about where the library is?â€ Meanwhile, Iâ€™m just making a mess like, â€œDonde esta la biblioteca? Krav Maga!â€ Bang! Kicking over lunches. Then I just go to apologize, buy combo B platters for everybody. Lo siento, lo siento. No soy Jason Bourne. Lo siento. The worst are, like, the thoughts that you donâ€™tâ€¦ Like, the stuff that just pops in your head. Youâ€™re like, â€œWhy? Why is that who I am?â€ Just the scary stuff. The scary stuff that you just keep pushed down all the time and then just one day, justâ€¦ bink! â€œGod, Iâ€™m a horrible person.â€ You know? You drive by a forest preserve or a nice park on your way to work. Nine times out of ten, youâ€™re like, â€œMan thatâ€™s a niceâ€¦ â€œOne of these days, Iâ€™m gonna have a picnic â€œin that forest. â€œIt was nice that they set that land aside. â€œIâ€™m gonna have a picnic. â€œMaybe Iâ€™m gonna fly one of those fancy kites â€œthat people learn how toâ€¦ â€œMaybe thatâ€™ll be my hobby, nice kites. The fancy, ornate ones.â€ And then thereâ€™s that one time like, â€œMan, if I have to hide a body, â€œthatâ€™s the park I would do it in. â€œThatâ€™s the best place. â€œYeah, man, chop it up, spread it out, â€œmake sure to get rid of those fingers and the teeth, â€œâ€™cause how they find them. I watch CSI a whole bunch.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œWhy are you thinking about hiding a body?â€ â€œWell, I donâ€™t know, maybe I would have to kill somebody.â€ â€œWhy would you have to kill somebody?â€ â€œWell, what if somebody hurt my family?â€ â€œNow youâ€™re just making a list of justifiable murders.â€ And then thatâ€™s on your way to your work, and you donâ€™t like your job so much. And nine times out of ten now, youâ€™re like, â€œThatâ€™s where I hide bodies. Maybe one of these days, when Iâ€™m done hiding these bodies, Iâ€™ll learn how to fly that fancy kite Iâ€™ve been talking about.â€ I donâ€™t like those thoughts. I donâ€™t like â€™em. Itâ€™s justâ€¦ bink! â€œYou thought this.â€ â€œYou son of a bitch.â€ I was in Louisville, Kentucky. I hadnâ€™t been there before. Just walking around, trying to get some lunch. Looking for lunch in all the wrong places. Walking around I sawâ€¦ It was, it was two black guys, and one of them was holding a white baby. I was like, â€œThey stole that baby.â€ I didnâ€™t wantâ€¦ Itâ€™s not like I put it together. It was likeâ€¦ bink! â€œThatâ€™s what you thought.â€ â€œYou son of a bitch.â€ And the irony was, I was on my phone trying to find out if a particular sandwich chain had donated to anti-gay charities, â€™cause Iâ€™m like, â€œI cannot support that. â€œThat is hatred, and I will not eat there. â€œIâ€™ll make my own sandwich. â€œIâ€™ll go buy bread and meat if I have to, â€œbut I will not support that kind of hatredâ€¦ â€œThose guys stole that baby. But I will not go eat at this place.â€ I didnâ€™t even think that theyâ€¦ Maybe they were gay, â€™cause one of them was smoking. I was like, â€œGay dads donâ€™t smoke.â€ Thatâ€™s not even a thing. Thatâ€™s what I made up after the other thing that popped in there. â€œHow are you gonna justify â€œthinking that the two black guys stole the white baby? Why arenâ€™t they just gay guys?â€ â€œWell, one of themâ€™s smoking. Gay dads donâ€™t smokeâ€ â€œStop making up stereotypes.â€ Iâ€™m disgusted with myself. I went to Seoul, South Korea, last year. Iâ€™d never been to Asia. I was just taking in this amazing, amazing city. And Iâ€™m just walking aroundâ€¦ Bright, sunny day, walking around the market, and just out in the sunshine, and Iâ€™m the only one wearing sunglasses. Iâ€™m like, â€œHow come Iâ€™m the only one wearing sunglasses?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThey donâ€™t need them â€œâ€™cause their eyes are alreadyâ€¦ â€œdonâ€™t even finish it. â€œDonâ€™t even finish it. Why is that whatâ€™s in here?â€ And itâ€™s not even, like, a badâ€¦ Itâ€™s like, you donâ€™t need sunglasses, thatâ€™s kind of a nice thing. Thatâ€™s convenient, but itâ€™s still bad. Iâ€™m not any happier about this than you guys are, all right? Iâ€™m upset with myself. But thatâ€™s whatâ€¦ like, you see people like, â€œStereotypes exist for a reason.â€ â€œYeah, â€™cause youâ€™re a dickhead. Thatâ€™s why they exist.â€ Thatâ€™s great. â€œAsians are bad drivers.â€ Go to Asia. Asians are amazing drivers. Theyâ€™re just punk rock about it. They just donâ€™t give a shit about the rules when they come over here. Thereâ€™s a traffic circle with 9,000 people in Seoul, South Korea. No lines, no lights, just whirring. I saw a guy on a scooter with 19 chickens on the back cut off a bus. He didnâ€™t lose the ash off his cigarette. That guy comes over here, youâ€™re like, â€œYouâ€™re not using your signal.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œScrew you. â€œIâ€™ve driven over bombed-out bridges, I can handle a merge.â€ But redefine that. If youâ€™re Asian, put NASCAR bumper stickers all over the back of your car and just blow some hillbillyâ€™s mind that wants to believe like, â€œCourse heâ€™s a crummy driver, heâ€™s an Asianâ€¦ â€œHold on a second here. What? â€œWait, no, this guyâ€™s clearly a fan of the sport. â€œNo, I think this guy knows exactly whatâ€™s heâ€™sâ€¦ â€œthis is some kind of new drafting technique. â€œWe gotta watch this guy. â€œCall up Dale. Call up Dale. Tell him the Asians are on him now.â€ You know, thereâ€™s a stereotype that black people like to talk in movie theaters. Thereâ€™s a stereotype that white people are uptight. Kind of proved that one when I said that thing about black people and nobody knew if they could laugh or not. If youâ€™re black and youâ€™re here, please do this. Sit next to the most uptight, white person you can find in the movie theater. Not tough to do. Like, single guys at the movies. The worst. See those guys who are like, â€œNo, you sit two down, you sit three down. No. Gay buffer. Gay buffer.â€ â€œYeah. â€œGoodâ€¦ good thing you did that, â€œâ€™cause I was totally waiting for Transformers 3 â€œto, fuck you. â€œNow I canâ€™t â€™cause of the seats. â€œNow I canâ€™t blow you during Transformers 3 because of your elaborate scheme.â€ Sit right next to that dude, and watch him already, like, â€œWell, thereâ€™s plentyâ€¦ I put those seats here for a reason.â€ And then say something during the movie, but say something thatâ€™s gonna blow the white dudeâ€™s mind. Thatâ€™s how you twist it. You like, you wait until, like, the action gets right at theâ€¦ at the pinnacle, then you just blurt something out like, â€œThis reminds me of Woody Allenâ€™s earlier work!â€ And heâ€™s just likeâ€¦ â€œThatâ€™s exactly what I was thinking,â€ you know? Really let him have it. â€œThis lighting is reminiscent of Kurosawaâ€™s.â€ â€œCan we go to the movies all the time?â€ I think between that and a quality spicy mayonnaiseâ€¦ weâ€™re not gonna solve racism, but weâ€™re gonna shave some of the sharp edges off of it.
Spicy mayonnaise? Spicy mayonnaise. Youâ€™re the same idiot upset about pho. Of course youâ€™d understand why spicy mayonnaise will unite the races, youâ€™re whiter than I am.
All right. Pull it together. Thanks for being here.
It was free.
Whatâ€™d you say? Your friends even shut you up there. All right. I had one flightâ€¦ I was going cross-country, L.A. to New York, And I bought a ticket on Orbitz and I got a direct flight on Orbitz, and thatâ€™s not supposed to happen. No. No. Orbitzâ€¦ Itâ€™s a good website, but weâ€™d would be like, â€œHey Orbitz, I wanna go from here to that stool,â€ and Orbitz would be like, â€œNo problem, man. You just gotta go to Denver five times first.â€ And I like saving $37, so Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right. â€œGo Broncos or whatever. â€œLetâ€™s see whatâ€¦ letâ€™s see whatâ€™s going on in Denver. I donâ€™t know, â€™cause Iâ€™m gonna save $37.â€ So I get it andâ€¦ I get it and Iâ€™m excited, but Iâ€™m suspicious at the same time â€™cause thatâ€™s not how itâ€™s supposed to work. And I canâ€™t just have nice things â€™cause I was raised Catholic, so everything has some kind of guilt price tag attached to it. Like,â€ somethingâ€™s working out. Something bad has to happen. Whatâ€™s it gonna be?â€ Like, you just canâ€™t have that, youâ€™re Catholic. â€œTwo sunny days in a row?â€ â€œYeah, but your friendâ€™s gonna die.â€ â€œWhy? Why canâ€™t things just be nice? Why canâ€™t I just like something andâ€¦ because itâ€™s nice?â€ So I get to the airport. I got a lot of trepidation at the airport. Iâ€™m thinking maybe the airplaneâ€™s gonna be messed up. Like, itâ€™s gonna have, like, one jet engine, one propeller engine. Some kind of Johnny Cash, one-piece-at-a-time assembled aircraft. So Iâ€™m inspecting it with all aeronautical knowledge Iâ€™ve accrued being a comedian. So Iâ€™m, like, in the gate, looking at it. Iâ€™m looking under it from the gate. Like, â€œYeah, it looks like itâ€™s all right. Looksâ€¦ looks safe.â€ Iâ€™m telling people like, â€œIt looks safe.â€ They donâ€™t care. I get to board first. Itâ€™s like, â€œAll right. Well, how about this?â€ I get, you know, I get an aisle seatâ€¦ â€œAre you kidding me? I get to stretch the ponies out the whole time? Maybe things are just looking up.â€ The planeâ€™s boarding. Iâ€™m sitting there. Everybody else is coming on. Along come the people thatâ€™ll be sitting next to me in my row. Theyâ€™re two chubby Spaniardsâ€¦ A couple. Spaniards. They were white, but speaking Spanish. They werenâ€™t, like, conquistadors. They werenâ€™t looking for gold, wearing armor. They were just white and speaking Spanish. You donâ€™t know how to comprehend that, â€œSpaniardâ€ is a fun word to say, the hell with it. Weâ€™re calling them Spaniards. And they take their seats. All right. And away we go. Plane taxiing, takes off. In the ascent of the airplane, the Spaniards, wasting no time, that armrest goes up and they start trying to fuck. Just right there. Seats A and B. Seat C, Kyle Kinane. A and B, fucking. Two-thirds, fucking. One-third, Kyle Kinane, not invited to the party, and Iâ€™m upset about that. And in their defense, they werenâ€™t, likeâ€¦ There wasnâ€™t just naked butts in the air. They had pulled a big coat up over them, but you know whatâ€™s happening under there. Thereâ€™s movements. Theyâ€™re not playing cards under there, all right? Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m just gonna hear â€œUno!â€ You know, thatâ€™s not how it works. I guess I would probably hear â€œOne.â€ I donâ€™t know how it works with the translation. A little wordplay for you. Butâ€¦ so Iâ€™m upset. Right away, Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, this is unacceptable, and I do not like this, and Iâ€™m upset.â€ I can see my flight attendant. Sheâ€™s still strapping. Weâ€™re taking off. Weâ€™re not even in a place where the flight attendant can even walk around. And Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ve got my speech prepared for her.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€¦ When we get up there and you get over here and youâ€¦ â€™cause this is not appropriate behavior for air travel.â€ But exactâ€¦ Whatâ€™s she gonna say? I know exactlyâ€¦ sheâ€™s gonna come over and be like, â€œDid you get your ticket on Orbitz?â€ Iâ€™m gonna be like, â€œSon of a bitch.â€ $37 of savings right there. $37. And so I gotta sit there and deal with my emotions. Iâ€™m forced to deal with this situation. Why am I upset about this? I started to get a little bit easier with it because I got flattered for a second, because thatâ€™s premeditated behavior. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ you know that youâ€™re gonna do that. You donâ€™t just, like, start on a plane, like, taking off, like, â€œYou feel like having a screw? â€œYeah? All right. Good. Good, good. Here we go.â€ You know, youâ€™re at least at the gate making the eyes, like, â€œYou know. â€œYou know. You know. We go up and then we get down.â€ So that means they walked on the plane with that knowledge already, meaning they had to go by me and put a judgment on me. They had to walk by and silently be like, â€œI bet heâ€™s cool with it.â€ So that got me. That flattered me. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m a cool guy. I am a cool guy. I donâ€™t want you to think Iâ€™m not a cool guy.â€ I donâ€™t know, maybe they got a bucket list. Number 97, you know? â€œScrew on a cross-country flight.â€ I donâ€™t know. But I just realized that Iâ€™m not on this Earth to be a goalie. Iâ€™m not here to stop somebody from accomplishing their goals. If youâ€™re not hurting anybody, Iâ€™m here to either assist or get out of the way. Thatâ€™s really all it is. Thatâ€™s really how it should be. Theyâ€™re not hurting anybody. Theyâ€™re doing the opposite. Very aggressively, but theyâ€™re doing the opposite. So Iâ€™ve realized, like, listenâ€¦ like, listen, Iâ€™m gonna put my own theories to the test. Iâ€™m gonna let them do what they need to do. Iâ€™m gonna be a cool guy about this. But because Iâ€™m gonna let them do what they have to do, Iâ€™m gonna do what I have to do, which, in this situation, is get wildly drunk and watch the shit out of this. Not like an old-time spy, you know, like, newspaper and fedora. No. Tray table down, elbow posted up, like Iâ€™m watching a chess match. So I was like, â€œOoh, youâ€™re gonna move the rook? Whatâ€¦ ooh, Bobby Fischerâ€™s back in town!â€ Finally, the flight attendant comes by and she looks overâ€¦ Like, looks at me, â€™cause itâ€™s clear whatâ€™s going onâ€¦ And I was just like, â€œCâ€™est la vie,â€ or whatever dumb thing I said to her. And so I was getting my drinks, and so I ordered â€™em two at a time. And justâ€¦ bang, bang. â€œLook at that over there. Thatâ€™s a good move. I like that one.â€ Bang, bang. â€œHow did youâ€¦ â€œNow thatâ€™s justâ€¦ I donâ€™t evenâ€¦ Well, good for you.â€ And eventually, theyâ€™re not coming fast enoughâ€¦ the drinks. The Spaniards are doing fine. Theyâ€™re doingâ€¦ Theyâ€™re European. Theyâ€™re a passionate people. Theyâ€™re okay. So eventually, I decide Iâ€™m going to procure my own beverages. This process starts with a blanket statement I make to the entire cabin of â€œIâ€™m gonna go to the bar.â€ Nowâ€¦ if you wanna know how you can tell if youâ€™ve been over-served on an airplane, start with a blanket statement to everyone. And in that statement, include a part of the aircraft that doesnâ€™t exist. â€œThe bar.â€ I may as well have been like, â€œIâ€™m gonna take a dip in the hot tub.â€ Like, it made just as much sense. I get up, I address the people sitting across the aisle from me, who Iâ€™ve never spoken to before. But now itâ€™s like weâ€™re old bar buddies, â€œHow we doing? Jimmy, we need a topper? Todd, you good on that?â€ Theyâ€™re asleep. They donâ€™t even know. I bumper bowl myself back to the bar, which is just the emergency exit and a cupboard. And I find my flight attendant and I ask for two more drinks. And sheâ€¦ she obliges initially. And she goes in there, and sheâ€™s tinkering around. But for some reason, she came back out with the drink, but she had this change of heart from that moment to here, Because she came likeâ€¦ Like just then she realized I pulled an A-ha video down the whole aisle, just slamming into stuff. â€˜Cause she brings the drinks out but sheâ€™s not presenting them to me, sheâ€™s got them locked back here. And she looks at me with this look of concern and she leans in and, like, does that whisper, like she doesnâ€™t want to embarrass me by what sheâ€™s about to say. And she just says, â€œAre you driving?â€ And I know she meant eventuallyâ€¦ but when the world gives you a little gift like that, you donâ€™t let it go to waste. So I put my hands around her hands on the drinks and then I leaned in even closer and I was like, â€œI hope not. I think we might be on an airplane.â€ And it was a little one of these, like, whoâ€™s joking around with who? And then I got â€™em and it was like, â€œYeah.â€ Wink. Point. â€œKeep it cool, hot stuff.â€ Whatever I said. And I get back to my seat with my little trophies there, and the Spaniards, theyâ€™re justâ€¦ Theyâ€™re sitting there. Like, I donâ€™t know if they got busted or they finished or what, but they think they were, like, smooth about it. They had no idea that the â€œtroisâ€ in the menage a trois we were havingâ€™s coming back. Third spokeâ€™s rolling by. So they just see this coming up with two drinks sloshing around going, â€œWhat? You donâ€™t dismount when the coach isnâ€™t around.â€ And then sittingâ€¦ Slam the drinks down like, â€œGoddamn Orbitz!â€ And they donâ€™t know what I mean by that. They think Iâ€™m just cursing the movement of celestial bodies. I want this to be an art form. I want comedy to be taken as an art form. I feel I put just as much heart and blood, sweat, and tears into this as any musician or any sculptor. And I want it to be appreciated as such. But then I was in a van with my friends not too long ago. And I unsolicitedly just announcedâ€¦ I said, â€œHey, guys, these farts are like contractions for the turd baby Iâ€™m gonna have later.â€ And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not an artist. Thatâ€™s why this is not getting federal funding. Thereâ€™s not gonna be a grant to perform this in the City Center for the citizens. I canâ€™t believe I made it anywhere creatively though, because I was raised by two loving and supportive parents, and nothing squashes creativity more than unconditional love and support from a functional household. If you have kids, shit on their dreams a little bit. Not all the way, but enough. Give â€™em some friction. You need to give â€™em something to fight against. I was supposed to be a musician, but I didnâ€™t get that friction. I wanted to be a musician. 16 years old, just, â€œIâ€™m starting a punk rock band! Screw you guys!â€ My momâ€™s like, â€œYou can practice in the basement Iâ€™ll make chili dip for your friends.â€ â€œNo!â€ So we practiced in the basement. I remember, â€œThis songâ€™s gonna take down the whole Bush regime.â€ Bass player was like, â€œIs your mom making that really good chili dip?â€ â€œGod damn it, Greg! â€œWould you focus on the anarchy at hand? We only got till 11:00 till we got to shut it down.â€ Anarchy closes at 11:00 in the suburbs. Iâ€™m from the suburbs. I think thereâ€™s some credit due to anybody that made it out of the suburbs because thatâ€™s a creeping oppression that you donâ€™t realize. Itâ€™s not a glaring, clear oppression. I mean, you grow up in the inner city and thatâ€™s bullets whizzing over your head. Youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m just gonna join a gang and deal drugs, â€œand Iâ€™m gonna get shot right in front of my mommaâ€™s house. And thatâ€™s how life is in the streets.â€ But thereâ€™s the one guy like, â€œNo, Iâ€™m gonna be a playwright, â€œand Iâ€™m gonna take this story to Broadway. And Iâ€™m gonna make it. Iâ€™m gonna get out of here.â€ And you grow up in the countryside and you just till the fields, sun up till sun down. And then when you die, they just take your body and they put it right in the field â€™cause itâ€™s fertilizer, it makes the corn grow higher. So youâ€™re just like, â€œFuck it! Iâ€™m gonna be a dancer!â€ And you move to the big city and you make it as a dancer. But you grow up in the suburbs, and itâ€™s just like, â€œWell, we can drive around smoking pot, â€œtalking about that philosophy class â€œthat we took at community college. And, you know, if you keep ordering stuff at Dennyâ€™s, â€œthey canâ€™t kick you out. â€œSo as long as weâ€¦ as long as we get, like, coffeeâ€¦ â€œIf we get, like, coffees or French fries, we can just hang out thereâ€ until, likeâ€¦ â€œHoly shit, Iâ€™m 35!â€ You know, you donâ€™tâ€¦ You donâ€™t realize that itâ€™s right there. I have friends that get surprised when you tell them how many kids they have. â€œI have three? â€œI forgot about the little one. Iâ€™m 35 now. Iâ€™m 35, I just got my own place. Took a while. Some people my age are astronauts. Iâ€™m just excited that I get to pee with the door open. Which is what I did at my old place, it just made my roommate sad. Be like, â€œYouâ€™re 35, you think you can close the door?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re 40 and living with a guy â€œthat pees with the door open. Maybe you need to get your life together.â€ â€œJudge not, lestâ€¦â€ how the rest of that goes. I just like how you get reminded of, like, your own immaturity. Like, I was using one of those accelerator hand dryersâ€¦ Like, the super high-powered onesâ€¦ And I realized, if I put my hands just right, I can make a totally wicked fart sound. And right as I perfected the fart sound, I remember like, â€œYeah, one of my best friends from high school is a surgeon.â€ But then I was just like, â€œThatâ€™s too bad. â€œHeâ€™s got no time to make wicked fart sounds â€œwith the hand dryer. â€œHeâ€™s got to scrub up â€œand get right to the operating room. â€œRough life for him. Rough life. Heâ€™s missing out.â€ I donâ€™t know if I got my own place because itâ€™s like, Iâ€™m thirâ€¦ like, thatâ€™s whatâ€¦ Like, it was the pressures of, like, societal pressures. Like, â€œThatâ€™s what you do. â€œYouâ€™re 35. Youâ€™re a grown man. â€œYou live by yourself and youâ€™re an independent man. â€œYou live by yourself and you start drinking scotch â€œinstead of crappy beer, and you switch back to briefs. â€œThatâ€™s what you do, â€™cause youâ€™re a grown man and thatâ€™s what grown men do.â€ Or if I got my own place â€™cause I realize Iâ€™m about to get the type of weird that I canâ€™t even have people witness on accident anymore. Things are about to get strange and Iâ€™m gonna need some solitude for that. And I think itâ€™s much more that. Itâ€™s not so much like, â€œIâ€™m gonna pay my bills on time and read more books.â€ Itâ€™s much more like, â€œTwizzlers look like they fit in buttholes, and I cannot have somebody walking into the laboratory when Dr. Kyleâ€™s conducting his experiments.â€ Itâ€™s this corkscrew shape. Lick â€™em and stick â€™em, fellas. Find out about your bodies. Itâ€™s 2012. Itâ€™s not gay. Itâ€™s about loving yourself. Itâ€™s okay. A lot of people think Henry David Thoreau went into the woodsâ€¦ Civil disobedience, self-reliance. No. Twizzlers in buttholes. â€œTâ€ in the â€œB.â€ Thatâ€™s what he needed. Read Walden real close. â€œTâ€ in the â€œB.â€ That is stupid. Man.
Hey, you guys ever get so lonely you sleep on your own couch instead of in your own bed â€™cause at least that way it feels like youâ€™re laying next to somebody? â€œLooks like Iâ€™m the little spoon again tonight.â€ Maybe throw an ex-girlfriendâ€™s old t-shirt on a pillow. Not for humping, just for cuddling. Nobodyâ€™s weird here. â€œLonelinessâ€ is a subjective term. You know, itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s different for everybody. I mean, youâ€™re a castaway on an island. Thereâ€™s nobody around. Thatâ€™s lonely, you know? But it could also mean you lack the simple courage to be able to say, â€œHelloâ€ to somebody sitting next to you on a bus. Thatâ€™s lonely too, you know? For me, I can define loneliness. I can just hone it in as the very moment that I realized that I had forgotten I was masturbating at a motel in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s the point. That what I remember. â€˜Cause thatâ€™s what happens. Iâ€™m a comedian. My dream came true. A lot of my dream is just me in a hotel room treating myself like an animal. Justâ€¦ Itâ€™s not even sexual anymore. Itâ€™s just, like, an aggressive shooing away of a nuisance at this point. So like Iâ€¦ â€œCome on, get out of here.â€ Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m taking a broom to get raccoons off the porch. Like, â€œCome on. Justâ€¦ yah! Yah!â€ I understand now why a dog can hump something but still look right at you. Like, I understand that. You see a dog, itâ€™s like, â€œWhat? â€œThis feels good and youâ€™re my buddy. â€œWhatâ€™sâ€¦ why? â€œYouâ€™re the one making it weird. What? What?â€ It was. I was just, like, in the shower and thereâ€™s a boner. I was like, â€œWell, roll up your sleeves, you know?â€ â€œItâ€™s like shoveling snow at this point. You know what we do. Something you gotta do.â€ Just dead-eyed, staring at a wall. And I realized that on the shelf there, Iâ€™d bought the little size of shampooâ€¦ I bought dandruff shampoo on accident. And I saw that and I was like, â€œI donâ€™t have dandruff.â€ And I remembered thatâ€™s, like, the old Head and Shoulders jingle. â€˜Cause I was like, â€œI donâ€™t have dandruff,â€ and then, out loud, I just went, â€œExactly.â€ Then I gotâ€¦ And I had a little chuckle. I had a little chuckle to myself. Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s funny. â€œIf youâ€™re making jokes like this and youâ€™re in the shower, â€œyouâ€™re right to go out there and pursue your dreams, Kyle. â€œYouâ€™re on the right path. â€œYouâ€™re doing this stuff in the shower. â€œYouâ€™re cutting yourself up. â€œYouâ€™re doing the right thing with your life. â€œAnyway, what elseâ€¦ What were we doing? Yeah, wellâ€¦â€ Man. Itâ€™s good I got my own place, because, like, instead of going to the gym like, I could just stay home and cry now, so thatâ€™s pretty awesome. You macho guys crying yet? You doing any of that stuff? Tough guys? Having a good cry? Waylon Jennings, you getting one? I love a good old cry. Itâ€™s good for you. Do what you gotta do. Allow that. Itâ€™s not good to keep that stuffâ€¦ do what you do. Pull the drapes, put on a DVD of How To Train Your Dragon, let it out. Let it out. Itâ€™s not good to keep all those emotions bottled up inside of you. Now, itâ€™s not great to uncork â€™em all at the grocery store at 11:30 at night. But once youâ€™ve allowed yourself these triggers, you donâ€™t know when that magical Linda Ronstadt song is gonna play, and youâ€™re just in the frozen food section like, â€œWeâ€™re doing this here? â€œWeâ€™re doing this here. Okay. â€œWhoo-hoo-hoo. All right. â€œWow. â€œStoufferâ€™s frozen dinner for two? â€œLooks like Iâ€™m gonna have leftovers on that one, Yeah, she is gone. All right.â€ You ever see a TV dinner just abandoned in the beer aisle? Yeah, thatâ€™s me. I did that. Thatâ€™s my street art. Take that, Banksy. I donâ€™t even have to mess up anybodyâ€™s wall or nothinâ€™. Just left some Salisbury steaks up top some Coors Lights. I think you get the message. I amâ€¦ Iâ€™m very fortunate. Iâ€™m lucky Iâ€™m a comedian, â€™cause otherwise my life would just be a series of undocumented low points. I donâ€™t know how you guys do it. Hats off to you, really. I meanâ€¦ Fighting the good fight out there. No, I just try to, like, make sure I learn a lesson from whatever I get into. Get the lesson out of it, you know? Like, I had a veryâ€¦ I had a very particular low point. It was a few months back, and I was at a 7-Eleven buying dinner. And thatâ€™s not where you get a staple if youâ€™re in the vicinity of somebody that loves you. I was not. I was in Los Angeles. Nobody loves anybody down there. Nevertheless, I was there, I think even sadder yet is I knew exactly what I wanted too, â€™cause I made a beeline right for that little hot dog aquarium thatâ€™s on the counter in there. Which is its own metaphor for sadness, â€™cause all those meats, theyâ€™re all rolling towards you but theyâ€™re not gaining any ground. Itâ€™s just steamy frustration in there. Like, you could almost hear the hot dog like, â€œI can see the horizon! Weâ€™re gonna make it! No, no, no, no, no!â€ Andâ€¦ and amongst all the tumbling, sweaty meats, there was one lone Cheeseburger Bite left in there. Which if you donâ€™t know what a Cheeseburger Bite is, Iâ€™ma tell you. Itâ€™s a cheeseburger, sure, but itâ€™s shaped like a hot dog. Because 7-Elevenâ€™s whole ad campaign right now, I think, is just â€œFuck it. â€œYouâ€™re gonna eat it. â€œYouâ€™re gonna eat it. â€œYouâ€™re not gonna eat it? â€œFree cheese. Told you youâ€™d eat it.â€ And I donâ€™t know how it came into being, you know? I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s some weird Dr. Moreau-type character in R&D at 7-Eleven thatâ€™s just trying to mash shitty foods into one another. Like, â€œHot dogs will become cheeseburgers! Cheeseburgers will become hot dogs!â€ Or if somebody dropped an actual cheeseburger onto that perpetual motion machine, and then just the sheer force of time and movement, it acquired the shape of a hot dog, a lot like how broken glass gets smoothed out and jewel-like if the waves crash on it in the sand. Clearly, Iâ€™ve thought about this far too much. But Iâ€™m in there and Iâ€™m just pointing it out. Iâ€™m excited about it. And the midnight clerk at 7-Eleven comes over, a man who should not have hope left for society. He shouldnâ€™t care what anybody does. This guyâ€™s offâ€¦ Heâ€™s off the grid at this point. Even this guy tried to give me an out. Even he tried to, like, stop what he was about to see. See, like, the sameâ€¦ like, when a blackjack dealer sees somebody thatâ€™s just wasted, theyâ€™re hitting on 20, and even they canâ€™t take it anymore. Theyâ€™re just likeâ€¦ just likeâ€¦ He gave me one of those. He came over, but he put the question on me, let it be my choice. He just came over and heâ€™s like, â€œWhat are you doing? â€œLook at what youâ€™re doing. What are you doing?â€ And I justâ€¦ I didnâ€™t even look up from the plastic. I was just like, â€œIâ€™m a gambler!â€ And he didnâ€™t even realize what that meant. But thatâ€™s where his face just dropped. He didnâ€™t even use tongs, just grabbed it with his hands. Bun, here you go. I didnâ€™t eat it as much as I made it disappear like a David Blaine illusion. Thing came at me, it was just like, â€œCrumbs. Magic hands!â€ Like, one fell swoop. Myarf! Debit card, 1.89. Shoomp, shoomp! Chase rewards points! And I had to get out to the sidewalk before I realized what, like, everything that just happened. Like, I just ate the same dinner as a homeless person, but I didnâ€™t even savor it. I didnâ€™t even appreciate it. And, that was a low point. That was aâ€¦ that was a Tuesday. And then Wednesday I got a DUI and I went to jail. For the more poetic of you out there, Whiskey Icarus finally flew a little too close to the sun. And, I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever been to jail before, but when you go there, itâ€™sâ€¦ You get to sit on a little bunk bed without your shoelaces and you get to contemplate your life. You get to askâ€¦ say things to yourself like, â€œHey, Kyle, â€œremember when you thought eating that Cheeseburger Bite â€œwas a real low point? â€œItâ€™s time to recalibrate your definition of fucking up. They took your belt so you donâ€™t hurt yourself.â€ And Iâ€™m not trying to make light of drinking and driving. I made a mistake, I screwed up, but understand that there are grades to that crime. There are degrees to drinking and driving. I got my DUI in Los Angeles. Iâ€™m from Chicago, where to get a DUI in Chicagoâ€¦ We got some people. You, clearly, will understand this. You would have to drive through a playground at recess and still fail a field sobriety test. I pulled over on the highway once â€™cause even I knew I was too drunk to drive in Chicago. Pulled over, shirt open. Gonna take a nap. Keys in the ignition, â€™cause I like to listen to tunes while I slumber. Woke up with police flashlights shining in my face and them just saying, â€œLet me see your hands!â€ And my first thing I just blurt out is like, â€œHowâ€™d you guys get in my room?â€ They let me drive home. Said, â€œYou take this room back to the house that it is a part of.â€ I got my DUI in Los Angeles, where to get a DUI there, you just have to look like this and be singing classic rock a little too enthusiastically at 1:30 in the morning while going five miles an hour over the speed limit. But I learned my lesson, donâ€™t drink and drive. Also learned my lesson, donâ€™t get your lawyer based off of Yelp reviews. â€œWell, Darrell from Burbank gave him four stars. â€œHow bad could he be? â€œDarrell also reviewed the coffee at a Jiffy Lube. â€œAlso four stars. â€œHe doesnâ€™t want to praise too much, â€œbut he wants to be encouraging. I like his style.â€ I think Iâ€™m just gonna start believing in God again. Why not? Not out of any kind of, like, repent or anything. Iâ€™m not soâ€¦ Iâ€™m just bored. Itâ€™s just a more fun place if youâ€™re agnostic. Like, just leave the â€œmaybeâ€ there, you know? It just more fun. Like, â€œWhy do trees grow so tall?â€ â€œMaybe itâ€™s God.â€ â€œIs that a guy following us with a knife?â€ â€œMaybe itâ€™s a chupacabra.â€ You know? It justâ€¦ The worldâ€™s a more whimsical place if you get into that. I want to believe in ghosts. Like, thatâ€™s why I get maid service. I like to pretend itâ€™s a real courteous poltergeist. â€œSpirits are real and they made the bed. That was real nice of them.â€ I believe in Bigfoot. I think Bigfootâ€™s real, but I think his whole thing is that heâ€¦ He fucks you while youâ€™re camping. And thatâ€™s why the true story never came out. Youâ€™re just camping, your tent opens up and youâ€™re like, â€œMan, itâ€™s Bigfoot.â€ And heâ€™s just like, â€œShh. â€œNobodyâ€™s gonna believe you, bro. Take off your pants.â€ Thatâ€™s why Bigfoot walks like that. All laid back. Just got done fucking. â€œShit, there goes Bigfoot! â€œLooks like he just got his dick wet, yeah! Bigfoot!â€ Thatâ€™s the dumbest joke Iâ€™ve ever written. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m justâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna be agnostic. I was an atheist, but, man, those people are just the worst. Theyâ€™re just as bad as everybody else. Atheism. Atheismâ€™s just, likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s dangerous when youâ€™re a teenager. Itâ€™s interesting in college. And after that youâ€™re just a drip that ruins parties by starting everything with, â€œYou seem like an intelligent person.â€ Itâ€™s cool that you haveâ€¦ I just donâ€™t trust anybody that is so positive thatâ€¦ Like, so certain about something you canâ€™t prove, you know, either way. Eitherâ€¦ either side you fall on, God or no God. I donâ€™t trust them and I donâ€™t trust people that have confidence without alcohol. I do not trust those people. Somebody that can dance when theyâ€™re sober is the scariest person youâ€™ll ever meet. Those should be the first people in line for murder suspects. If youâ€™reâ€¦ Youâ€™re just at a wedding, you see somebody getting really loose. Like, â€œMan, how many have you had?â€ â€œNot a drop since â€™97. Donâ€™t like losing control of myself.â€ â€œYou get outta here, baby eater.â€ But, yeah, I donâ€™t know. Like, I had thisâ€¦ I hadâ€¦ I guess itâ€™s an epiphany. I donâ€™t know what it was. I was making some IKEA furniture and I wasnâ€™t even using the instructions. So I was just, like, freestyling on it. So that pretty much makes me a carpenter. And so I started like, â€œHere I am, â€œjust this little bearded guy being a carpenter, â€œand Jesus is just a little bearded carpenter. â€œAnd he just traveled the land â€œtrying to make people happy and better. â€œLike, I just travel the land trying to make people happy. â€œAnd maybe Iâ€™ve been a Christian this whole time, â€œI just didnâ€™t even know it, because you try and live â€œin a more Christlike way. And thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been doing this whole time.â€ But then I realized that Jesus probably never called a TV stand a bitch five times and then took a nap to Cheers reruns out of frustration. He would have persevered where I faltered. So that, and some other things, are why Iâ€™m not like Jesus. But I have been getting the stigmata a whole lot lately, so thatâ€™s been throwing me off. Not traditional, like, holes in the hands and speakingâ€¦ Iâ€™ve just been getting fat and going bald. Itâ€™s some Buddhist stigmataâ€¦ Something. Iâ€¦ I watched this documentaryâ€¦ You guys probably know it up hereâ€¦ Called The Bridge. Yeah, nobody ever cheers if they saw it. They justâ€¦ For those of you that donâ€™t know, itâ€™s a documentary about all people that jump off the Golden Gate Bridge trying to kill themselves. And it was justâ€¦ I thought it was a fascinating film â€™cause they set up cameras and they caught these people. Well, they didnâ€™t catch â€™em, but on film. And theyâ€¦ Yeah, yeah. I did that in San Francisco. Like I understand the why. I understand if you want to take an early exit. Like, if you get to that point in your life where youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m just gonna go to work for the next 40 years. I donâ€™t like this today. 40 years of this?â€ And right when you kind of get your mind around like, â€œMaybe itâ€™ll be okay,â€ a coworker pops by like, â€œDonâ€™t forget, thereâ€™s karaoke every Tuesday!â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m taking off. No way.â€ So I understandâ€¦ I just never understood the how. â€˜Cause they show these people. Itâ€™s always the same kind of person, just kind of disheveled, dirty sweatpants, shuffling up the edge. A little bit of hemming and hawing, and then justâ€¦ pfftâ€¦ Over the side. Just, like, not even one of them wore a cape or anything. Itâ€™s the last thing youâ€™re gonna do. Go out with a question mark instead of a period. Let your loved onesâ€¦ Itâ€™s a selfish thing youâ€™re doing. Give your loved ones just, like, a moment of like, â€œWhaâ€¦ Really?â€ I donâ€™t know, you know? Go nice suit, umbrella at the last minute. Mary Poppins theme. Confuse people. Have one last trick up your sleeve, you know? If I get to that point where Iâ€™m gonna get outta here, Iâ€™m not gonna lose my commitment to the art of performance or personal flair. I will do it. Iâ€™m gonna jump off a building. But Iâ€™m gonna do it wearing a snorkel mask and flippers. And then right next to where Iâ€™m gonna land, I wanna have a little glass of water set up. Because that way, people can wonder, â€œDid he wanna kill himself or is this just the worst daredevil weâ€™ve ever seen?â€ There wouldnâ€™t even be a suicide, thereâ€™d just be a Post-it on the ledge like, â€œI think I can make it.â€ People are like, â€œMake what? â€œWhat was he gonna make? â€œThereâ€™sâ€¦ â€œLogistically, this is impoâ€¦ Maybe he didnâ€™t calculate for wind, I donâ€™t know.â€ Just allow that much. And then when I do dieâ€¦ I donâ€™t have a lot of goals for my earthly time, but when I do pass, I want eitherâ€¦ I want to be cremated, and I want the remains sprinkled on my motherâ€™s living room carpeting with a little plaque that says, â€œLook whoâ€™s not vacuuming now?â€ It was one of my chores. Itâ€™d be like an inside joke. Itâ€™d be a cute thing for her. â€œYou want to keep your baby boy close? â€œIâ€™m right here. â€œLiving roomâ€™s only for guests? Well, now Iâ€™m the guest. â€œYou take the plastic off the couch. Iâ€™m sticking around.â€ Thatâ€¦ orâ€¦ Your gravestone doesnâ€™t have to be factual. You know that, right? Your graveâ€¦ thatâ€™s yours. Make sure you take advantage of that. Thatâ€™s yours. Donâ€™t let some uncreative relative just put some schmâ€¦ â€œloving father.â€ Youâ€¦ that guy could have been a dick. You donâ€™t even know. I do wantâ€¦ thatâ€™sâ€¦ If I get that, I wanna have just the littleâ€¦ The tasteful little rectangular, flush with the ground headstones. Nothing fancy. Tasteful font. Itâ€™ll just say, â€œKyle Christian Kinane. â€œBorn December 23rd, 1976. Died in your arms tonight.â€ Quotes, â€œMust have been something you said.â€ Because listen, thatâ€™s not a great joke, all right? But itâ€™s the best one youâ€™re gonna read in a cemetery. And where more do you need a laugh in this world? Kyle Kinaneâ€™s got you, even after death. Kyle Kinane, A.D.â€™s here for you. Youâ€™re walking in there, itâ€™s a sad day, maybe you just see that, like, right there, peripheral vision, walking in and you justâ€¦ â€œLook at this. â€œYou see this? â€œItâ€™s â€™80s lyrics. â€œThis guy. â€œItâ€™s that songâ€¦ â€œ* Died in your arms tonight â€œThis guy. â€œCome here and look. Sheâ€™s not going anywhere. â€œCome here and look at this. â€œMy God. Thatâ€™s funny. â€œThat is all right. I like that. â€œNo flowers, thatâ€™s a shâ€¦ â€œIâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m stâ€¦ â€œYou donâ€™t get these today. â€œYou earned those today, buddy. That is a funny joke.â€
Guys, thank you so much. Thank you very much. ** Thanks for watching my show. Unless you chose to watch DVD extras first, in which case, you have strange priorities. I kind of like your style.

[indistinct chatter]
Ladies and gentlemen, Kyle Kinane!
[cheers and applause]
Wellâ€¦
[cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you very much. All right, all right. Wow. Thank you very, very much. Itâ€™s good to be taping a special in Chicagoâ€¦ at Metro. Back in my hometown. This feels great. Thank you for being here. I am on the road most of my life, so to come back home to tape a special, it means a lot to me. So, yeah.
[cheering]
Itâ€™s weird. I spend most of my time on the road, and I have to leave my girlfriend at home. And sometimes sheâ€™ll make mention that she might be getting a little bit jealous, that when Iâ€™m on the road, I might meet women after my shows. And itâ€™s hard to explain to her that I donâ€™t meet women after my shows. I meet guys that look exactly like me after my shows. Yeah. Not a line of babes waiting around backstage. Just a bunch of hirsute fart factories, smelling like expired mustard, leaning in, saying stuff like, â€œI get it, man.â€ Iâ€™m like, all right, okay, all right. Iâ€™m not sure what you get, but thanks for being here. Couldnâ€™t do it without you, fellas. Glad youâ€™re here. It is. Mostly, Iâ€™m glad about everybody who comes out and comes see me do comedy. Once in a while, an odd pickle will turn up. Most of the time, itâ€™s great, but once in a whileâ€¦ Like, I was in Louisiana, and there was a fella in the front row. He was like a real unpainted Juggalo type dude. You can pick them out sometimes. Like, oh, man. You see them in the raw, youâ€™re like, â€œAh, somebody hosed you off for a job interview, didnâ€™t they?â€ And his wardrobe of choice for the evening was a black t-shirt with white letters that just said, â€œI heart squirters.â€ Thatâ€™s what he wore. Thatâ€™s what he wore out in the world. Just wore that. Thatâ€™s like youâ€™re just dressing up for a mug shot with a shirt like that. And thatâ€™s one thing. Like, all right, thatâ€™s the sentiment you wanted to put into the world. Like, what were you hoping for? Whatâ€™s the intention of wearing that? Like you read â€œThe Secret,â€ and thatâ€™s what youâ€™re gonna will into the world. And do you think youâ€™re gonna connect with that special young lady whoâ€™s gonna relate to that shirt? You think that your princess is out there just going, â€œOh, no fellaâ€™s gonna understand me and my body, and how I get all strange when I get excited down there.â€ And thenâ€¦ And there you are. Youâ€™re right there with your â€œI heart squirtersâ€ shirt, like her shining wet knight, just waiting for her. And it was in the South too. If youâ€™re in Jersey and thatâ€™s your shirt, I understand. Itâ€™s like, â€œUh, I like squirters, see? I put it on my shirt.â€ But, like, the South, the South, you can finesse the language better down there. Itâ€™s a romantic region. You can massage the words to get your message out without being so direct. Like, in Louisiana, I would expect more of a gentlemanly sort of effort, like, â€œI do enjoy the fountain-esque ladies.â€ And just, â€œMm, mm.â€ Wish him the best of luck. Hope you find love out there. Iâ€™ve been out a lot. I was in Edinburgh, Scotland, for a month last year, doing shows. It was a fine time. I said the whitest thing Iâ€™ve ever said in my life in Edinburgh. Not anything terrible, but just white. Just white. You know, sometimes how youâ€™re hyper-aware of, like, â€œWhoa, that was white.â€ Like, where you even have to step back after something comes out of your mouth, like, â€œHo-ho, mm.â€ â€œThis tuna salad is pretty good, but it could use a little bit more mayonnaise, Barbara.â€ Ugh. Thought you were more well-rounded than that, dude. Come on, man. â€œA karaoke birthday party on a Monday. Youâ€™re crazy for this one, Timothy.â€ Egh. But then, once in a while, you just top yourself. Thatâ€™s what happened to me in Edinburgh. I think the exact phrase I used in Edinburgh, I was like, â€œI canâ€™t believe this castle doesnâ€™t have wi-fi.â€ That was it. Itâ€™s not getting whiter than that, dude. Thatâ€™s it. You complained about brand-new white shit inside of real old white shit. You just made a honky turducken, is what you did. All right. And then, I went from there. I went down to London. And I went on the Jack the Ripper tour in London, because thatâ€™s what I do, still. Like, I should grow up, but thatâ€™s the stuff Iâ€™m into. And itâ€™s a big deal there. Like, thereâ€™s still big advertisements. Like, â€œYou got to go on this Jack the Ripper tour.â€ And itâ€™s from the 1800s, but thatâ€™s still their big tour thing. â€œGo on the Jack the Ripper tour.â€ And you sign up for a tour, and thereâ€™s so many tours. Thereâ€™s like competing tours, and theyâ€™re cutting each other off in the street. Itâ€™s so popular. And you sign up, and you get assigned a tour guide whoâ€™s just a decrepit little English man, and heâ€™s dressed in the period. Heâ€™s got a top hat and a cloak, and heâ€™s using the scariest British voice. Or maybe just his British voice, â€™cause itâ€™s hard to tell with the old ones. The old ones always sound like theyâ€™re just dooming you no matter what, you know? â€œWhat time is it? 7:30.â€ All right. Heâ€™s leading us around the city on this tour. And the tour is interesting, but itâ€™s hard to focus on it, because youâ€™re still in a modern city. So heâ€™s trying to put you in the time period that this all happened, and heâ€™ll stop you on some part of the street where heâ€™s like, â€œAnd here, one of the victims was found, dissected with medical precision.â€ But youâ€™re still in front of a KFC. Itâ€™s kind of like, â€œEh.â€ Itâ€™s hard to focus. I mean, Iâ€™ve dissected a family bucket with medical precision. â€œThis tour is boring as shit.â€ But then we get to the end of it. We get to the big finale, and heâ€™s got everybody gathered around, and this is his big climax moment of the tour, and heâ€™s got everybody there, and this is where he just sends it home. And heâ€™s got everybody, he goes, â€œAnd itâ€™s believed that, in total, â€œJack the Ripper may have killed up to five victims.â€ Now, I know that this is a weird time to get welled up with national pride.
[laughter]
[applause]
But I had to turn to my friend. I was like, â€œDid he say five? â€œWeâ€™ve been rolling our ankles on cobblestone for three hours â€œfor five? â€œWe paid Â£60. â€œI donâ€™t even know how much that is in real money. For fucking five?â€ And I got real USA. I was like, â€œIâ€™m from America, baby. We got somebody killing five people right now.â€ And we donâ€™t give them walking tours, neither. You get a walking tour for everybody that killed five people in this country, the whole 48 lower states would just look like half-price tickets at Disneyland. Thatâ€™s what itâ€™d just look like. Wisconsin alone would have so many people in there, theyâ€™d be tipping off into the lake. You kill five people, you could defend yourself in court after killing five people and get off with, like, just, like, a warning. Thatâ€™s where weâ€™re at. You could be like, â€œAll right, yeah, â€œI know what happened, Your Honor, but listen. â€œYou know how they say McDonaldâ€™s â€œhas breakfast all day? â€œYeah, and then you get your hopes up. â€œBut then they can still run out of that shit. â€œAnd thatâ€™s what they donâ€™t tell you â€œwhen youâ€™re trying to have an egg McMuffin for dinner â€œand, like, â€˜Weâ€™re out of Canadian bacon.â€™ â€œSure, I got a little out of hand. I got a littleâ€“ I got a little out of hand.â€ The judge is like, â€œRough weekend, I understand. â€œWe all have them. â€œWe all have them, we all have them. It was a rough weekend.â€ You kill one person on accident in America, you donâ€™t even get arrested anymore. They make you a cop. Thatâ€™s what happens.
[applause]
â€œBut I donâ€™t want to be a police officer.â€ â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter. â€œYou passed the test, youâ€™re qualified. Welcome to the force.â€
Itâ€™s gonna be a veryâ€“ Itâ€™s gonna be a very interesting conversation weâ€™re gonna have to have in this country when thereâ€™s a mass shooting that targets a group of people we can all agree donâ€™t really need to be around anymore anyway. Itâ€™s gonna cross that line at some point. Letâ€™sâ€“I mean, all right, morose, yes. True, yes. â€œThere was another mass shooting.â€ â€œOh, my god, who were the victims this time?â€ â€œWestboro Baptist Church.â€ â€œHuh, hmm.â€
[applause]
See, no, no, no, itâ€™s a senseless loss ofâ€“ I canâ€™t. [laughing] Oh, God hates who? God hatesâ€“ I donâ€™t hear them anymore. I donâ€™t hear them.
[cheers and applause]
â€œRemember how you said you wanted to ban all the guns?â€ â€œI didnâ€™t say all the guns. â€œDid I say all the guns? â€œWhat kind of guns did they use? â€œI didnâ€™t mean those, not those. The other ones that kill the nice people.â€ I mean, Fred Phelps died. He was the leader of the Westboro Baptist Church. He died; Iâ€™ll miss him. He was such a good villain. You donâ€™t understandâ€“ you donâ€™t understand, like, how necessary a good villain is, â€™cause a good villain unites unlikely groups of people, and thatâ€™s what he did. Theyâ€™re so terrible, that you had just people that you have no idea would even know each other are now on the same side of picket lines against him. Thatâ€™s a good villain. You know, â€™cause you had, like, obviously, the gay rights people and that whole community, â€™cause they hated them for their tastefully worded signs they would hold up at all the street fairs and parades. But you know who else would protest Westboro Baptist Church? Hellâ€™s Angels would protest. You were such a dick, the Hellâ€™s Angels didnâ€™t like you. Thatâ€™s impressive. You know, the Hellâ€™s Angels were also anti-Westboro Baptist Church, because those Westboro folks, what they would do was, they would picket soldiersâ€™ funerals because they thought that American troops were dying overseas in wars because America was allowing gay people to get married. And I donâ€™t care what kind of spiritual mathematics youâ€™re working with. That doesnâ€™t add up at all. â€œNo, see, because of that, and now this.â€ No, man, no. Show your work. Yeah, you canâ€™t. You canâ€™t show your work. You canâ€™t show your work on that. So, yeah, obviously you have the gay rights, the gay people against them, but then, also, you had Hellâ€™s Angels, because bike gangs all formed from veterans coming back from World War II. Thatâ€™s how these bike gangs started. You donâ€™t mess with the veterans without the bike gangs getting involved. So now you had Hellâ€™s Angels and gay people on the same side of the line, just in their shared hatred of somebody. And you got to respect that level, that you brought those unlikely groups together, just lining up side-by-side, just like, â€œHa, huh, heyâ€¦ All right, yeah.â€ â€œHate these guys too, huh? â€œYeah, fuck these guys, man. â€œYeah, all right, all right. â€œYeah, they suck, yeah, all right, okay. â€œWhatâ€™s that? â€œCute vest? Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks.â€ â€œI like yours too. â€œI wouldnâ€™t have done all the fringe, but I like what youâ€™re doing with yours.â€ â€œOh, the hell with it, you know what? â€œWeâ€™re all going out for beers after this, â€œand I donâ€™t know what you guys were doing afterwards. â€œIf you want to just, you know, â€œhang out with us, have some beers. â€œYeah, okay, cool, yeah, why not, right? â€œAh, you need a ride. â€œUh, oohâ€¦ â€œI got the bike here. â€œWeâ€™re coming together. â€œYou know, get on, yeah, get on, buddy. â€œWeâ€™ll handle it, you get on there. â€œOh, look at that, youâ€™re getting on the front. â€œOkay, all right. â€œYou know what, itâ€™s a special day. â€œItâ€™s a special day. â€œLetâ€™s just let our hair blow in the breeze together. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ll say to that.â€ Got to be appreciative of that. Iâ€™m not evenâ€“ I donâ€™t know. I know itâ€™s weird with all the violence. Iâ€™m not even, like, an anti-gun guy or nothing. I donâ€™tâ€“whatever. Thatâ€™s my political stance. â€œWhatever.â€ Iâ€™m confused with, like, the open carry law, where you can legally just have one, justâ€¦ Not even hidden, just have it out. First off, like, thatâ€™s weird that you need to have it. Second off, I donâ€™t like the term â€œopen carry,â€ because thatâ€™s what I always would use for, like, open containers. Like, you could just walk around with a beer. And so, then, the first of the year rolls around, and theyâ€™re like, â€œWell, these are all the states where open carry is legal.â€ And Iâ€™m the idiot going, â€œWell, itâ€™s about time. â€œI should be able to walk around with one. â€œIâ€™m not hurting anybody. â€œShould be able to walk around with six of them, all right? â€œFriday doesnâ€™t even get started â€œunless I get through six of them, man. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m saying.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re not talking about beers, Kyle. Theyâ€™re talking about guns.â€ â€œHa-ha, oh, boy, I feel silly.â€ So the beerâ€™s still illegal? It is? Okay, cool laws. Cool laws, everybody. Cool laws that make total sense.
[cheers and applause]
I donâ€™t know. I just think that if you need to have the gunâ€¦ there needs to be a dress code also. You canâ€™t just have the gun and then wearâ€“ You needâ€“the rest of this needs to match, â€™cause not only do you have a weapon. You also have a very aggressive accessory now, all right? You have a centerpiece to your outfit. Itâ€™s the focal point, and the rest of it needs to coordinate. All right? Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m saying. Do you ever see a woman out with a tiara, but no ball gown? Just, like, sweatpants? Thatâ€™s a crazy person. Thatâ€™s what crazy looks like. Thatâ€™s not someone making sensible decisions. No, thatâ€™s a woman just yelling out, â€œThe Kremlin stole my babies!â€ And everybody is like, â€œI donâ€™t even need to be in this AutoZone right now. â€œI donâ€™t even needâ€“ â€œWhat did I need, seat covers? â€œIâ€™ll get seat covers tomorrow. â€œIâ€™m gonna let this weird, homeless princess find her children.â€ Thatâ€™s the same thing with a gun. You canâ€™t just have that, and then notâ€“ Thisâ€“if you have a gun here, the outfit needs to make you look like a responsible member of society, like you know what youâ€™re gonna do if that gun comes out of the holster. If thereâ€™s a gun here, this shit needs to look like John Wayne or Indiana Jones or Captain America. I donâ€™t know. Something that people will be like, oh, he knows what heâ€™s gonna do with the gun if itâ€™s got to come out of the holster. I was in Colorado. I saw a guy who was open carry right there, and I saw the gun first, and then I saw that it was attached to some board shorts. No! Long pants! Long pants! You have a weapon. Long pants! This low-rent Johnny Utah shit, when you got it clipped onto some swim trunks? With drawstrings? Heâ€™s using drawstrings to hold up the weight of a gun. You know how tight you got to pull those drawstrings? Now I know heâ€™s in a bad mood, â€™cause his hips have been chaffing all day. And thatâ€™s not the attitude you should have with a firearm, walking around like, â€œI should have powdered, â€œbecause Iâ€™m just getting all red on my hip bone. â€œWhat are you looking at? Stop looking at my calves!â€ And flip-flops. Get out of my country. Flip-flops. Flipâ€¦flops. I donâ€™t even own guns, but I know that if youâ€™re gonna draw down on somebody, â€™cause youâ€™re one of those good guys with a gun that stops all that crimeâ€“ thank you so much for how often thatâ€™s been happeningâ€“ if youâ€™re one of those guys, if you want to getâ€“ if you want good aim, close-toed shoes. God damn it! Close-toed shoes. Oh, youâ€™re gonna beâ€“youâ€™re the one whoâ€™s gonna stop a crime when you justâ€“you justâ€“ you take it out of the holster, and then youâ€™re just swishing around in your Tevas. Explain that to the cops when they get to the scene. Like, â€œWhat happened here?â€ â€œWell, I saw the perpetrator run out of the bank â€œwith a duffel bag full of loose bills, â€œso I deduced that he had robbed the bank. â€œAnd then, fortunately, Iâ€™m licensed open carry, â€œand so I went and pursued the suspect, â€œbut what had happened during that pursuit is, â€œI Jimmy Buffetted myself right onâ€“ â€œI just straight-up Margaritavilleâ€™d myself â€œand blew out a flip-flop. â€œYou know the song, Parrotheads, right? â€œAll right, yeah. â€œAnyway, yeah, I shanked it. â€œI shanked it. â€œThat one went off. â€œThat one went off into the playground over there. â€œFingers crossed, fingers crossed, right? I was trying to do the right thing.â€ That joke takes a wild turn. Iâ€™ve been in the South. Iâ€™ll be in Tennessee and stuff, and I donâ€™t know where open carry is legal, so I have to ask. Iâ€™ll be like, â€œIs open carry legal in this state?â€ And some people will be like, â€œYes, it is.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, thank you for just your monotonous answer of just yes or no.â€ Sometimes Iâ€™ll ask it in a place where people are way too enthusiastic about it. Like, â€œIs it open carry here?â€ â€œYouâ€™re god damn right it is!â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œWhoa.â€ I just got to change gears real fast with that joke. â€œYou bet your ass. This is America. It should be legal everywhere.â€ And all of a sudden, Iâ€™m like, â€œMan, have you guys ever had burritos? Itâ€™s like a taco got cold, you know what Iâ€™m saying?â€
I mean, come on, weâ€™re in Chicago. Itâ€™s easy to get all rah-rah, liberal, open-minded and clap about that stuff. Weâ€™re liberal, open-minded. If weâ€™re at this show, I would think weâ€™re not conservative, closed-minded people. I like getting around my liberal, open-minded friends. Theyâ€™re like, yeah, of course, obviously. Yeah, open-minded people, open-minded. If youâ€™re gay, straight, whoever, you get to marry whoever you want to marry. And if youâ€™re a woman, thatâ€™s your body, and itâ€™s your right to do want to do with that body. And if youâ€™re transgender, youâ€™re in a rough place right now with the way laws are going on. But, hey, weâ€™re all just pilots dropped into different vehicles in this world, and if you got to work with after-market parts to get it to where you want it to be, you work with after-market parts to get it to where you want to be. Yeah.
[cheering]
Yeah. I love being around all these open-minded liberal friends of mine. And then I love just pouring ketchup on a hot dog. Fuck you. Fuck you. Thatâ€™s right. Ooh, ooh! Sounds like somebodyâ€™s taste buds are Republican. Whoo, yeah. Pat yourselves on the back about being open-minded a little bit later, when you can stop thinking about punching somebody â€™cause they want to put pineapple on a pizza, you dick-heads. Iâ€™m in my hometown. I just pissed all over the stage. What are you gonna do about it? I got paid.
[cheers and applause]
[laughs] This wonâ€™t go on the special. I like that I think Iâ€™m being real punk rock by doing a ketchup on a hot dog joke. I almost saw the singer of Samiam get a blow job on this stage 15 years ago. But look at me, really blowing peopleâ€™s minds up here. Ridiculous. [laughs] Thanks for being good sports, everybody. Really appreciate it, thanks for coming out.
[applause]
I donâ€™t haveâ€“ I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m at politically. I really donâ€™t. But I just like poking holes in all of it. Thatâ€™s the only thing I feel like. I think every side can be tested, no matter what their convictions are. Like, one of the things, Iâ€™m not a gambler, but I like playing craps, not because of the gambling aspect, but just because, if youâ€™re playing craps, and youâ€™re the one rolling the dice, you know, and you got a real hot hand, and everybodyâ€™s winning money â€™cause youâ€™re doing real good with the dice, that means you get to yell out whatever you want, in the name of luck, to test the greed of the people around you. And thatâ€™s a fascinating position to be in, in this world, where you can really push the morals of strangers just for a few bucks, you know? You got to make sure youâ€™re on a lucky streak. You know, you got two or three good rolls in. And you throw out, like, a little tester. You know, throw out something like, â€œCome on, daddy needs some new shoes,â€ and be like, â€œLook at those shoes, those shoes suck. Letâ€™s get him them shoes!â€ And, like, â€œYeah,â€ theyâ€™re all cheering you on. But then, you get a few more in there, and everybodyâ€™s chips are getting a little bit higher and higher, and thatâ€™s when you drop stuff like, â€œMan, these Laotian child brides arenâ€™t getting any cheaper. You know what Iâ€™m saying?â€ â€œWhatâ€“ What did you hear him say?â€ â€œWhatâ€“ â€œNo, no. â€œHe just said heâ€™s getting married in Laotia. â€œWe got to get him on that honeymoon. â€œThatâ€™s what we got. We got to get him on thatâ€¦honeymoon.â€ â€œEverybody down at the pet store knows what I mean â€œwhen I tell them I need a cage for a â€˜big dog.â€™ [laughs] Whoo!â€ â€œNo, I heard him that time. â€œI heard him. â€œHeâ€™s gonna lock up those Laotian women. â€œHeâ€™s just confessing to crimes â€œhe canâ€™t afford to commit yet. â€œYeah, Iâ€™m staying in. Iâ€™m about to pay off that Sonata.â€ [laughs] Oh.
Letâ€™s see. Iâ€™ve got gout. Ha-ha. Yeah! I got gout!
[sparse applause]
[indistinct shouting]
What? Yeah.
man: How old are you?
How old am I? 39.
[cheering]
Do you want to ask more questions, or do you want to just let me finish the joke, and Iâ€™ll probably answer them in the joke?
[cheers and applause]
First, wait, are you worried about yourself getting it? â€˜Cause if youâ€™re at this show, youâ€™ve got it, dude. You all got it! [laughs] Yeah, itâ€™s real dumb. Iâ€™m not being brave or nothing up here. Itâ€™s a real dumb disease. Itâ€™s real stupid. Yeah, got it? All right, okay. Well, weâ€™ll get a support group after the show. Yeah, itâ€™s real dumb. You just get it from just eating and drinking whatever you want to eat and drink. I thought thatâ€™s what I was supposed to do. I thought thatâ€™s how life worked, you know? â€œYou should live life to the fullest, Kyle.â€ I did. I got fucking gout. They donâ€™t tell you the side effects of living your life by all these bumper sticker philosophies out there. Thereâ€™s no asterisk on there telling you, like, â€œOh, well, be forewarned that this might happen.â€ But I listened to all that stuff. â€œJust dance like nobodyâ€™s watching, Kyle. Dance like nobodyâ€™s watching.â€ But theyâ€™re watching, theyâ€™re watching. Theyâ€™re called security guards at Toys â€œRâ€ Us, and they are watching. Iâ€™m usually alone on this one. I donâ€™t know if anybody else does this. Whenever you drive by a Toys â€œRâ€ Us, do you ever just mutter, â€œWe sure areâ€? And then you curse the Illuminati for the rest of the day. No? Theyâ€™re waving it right in our faces! And weâ€™re not doing a god damn thing about it. So I went in, and I was all panicked about the gout. I was freaking out. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, my god, Iâ€™ve got a disease.â€ And Iâ€™m just being a victim about it, like, â€œOh, god, I have a thing.â€ And even my doctor was like, â€œStop being a baby. â€œItâ€™s easily manageable. â€œLots of people have gout. â€œYouâ€™ve got nothing to worry about. â€œYou can totally manage it. â€œAll you have to do, you just have to avoid, like, beer and any food you might find at a barbecue.â€ Yeah, all I heard was, â€œYouâ€™re gonna die.â€ Thatâ€™s what I heard. I know she was saying other words, but all I heard was like, â€œYouâ€™ve met the shepherd â€œthat is going to guide you into the great beyond, Kyle. And that shepherdâ€™s name is gout.â€ And I was justâ€“I was freaking out hard about it. And my doctor is my age. Thatâ€™s another weird thing, that a doctor is my age. You know, itâ€™s like, youâ€™re 39. How can you be a doctor already? Weâ€™re so young. We got so much more to go, baby. How can you beâ€“ What are you, like, one of them smart kids or something? Iâ€™m 39. I still think I might be a prodigy at something. Thatâ€™s the level Iâ€™m working at. Iâ€™m like, I donâ€™t even want to play chess. Iâ€™ll probably just beat those robots right away. Iâ€™ll Bobby Fischer this whole place, is what Iâ€™ll do. I do, I think Iâ€™m a prodigy. You know what kind of asshole that makes me at a Guitar Center? Ugh. Just walking in, kicking the doors open. â€œAll right, Iâ€™m probably gonna be awesome â€œat one of these things. â€œLetâ€™s figure it out. â€œIs it keyboards? â€œBa-dup bup-bup-bup. â€œNot feeling it, maybe itâ€™s drums. Bah bah bahâ€“ nope, thatâ€™s not it.â€ Every employee in there is like, â€œNormally, we would call this kidâ€™s mom to come pick him up, â€œbut this guy has male-pattern baldness and came in here with a cane.â€ I didnâ€™t realize thatâ€™s what you could do with 39 years. Thatâ€™s what she did. Over 39 years, she gained enough of this specific type of knowledge, that now what she can do is fix the human machine. Thatâ€™s what she can do with four decades, is, she can fix the human machine. And what I did with four decades is, I ate like a campground raccoon, so much so that I show up to her place of work so I could take off my skateboard shoe so she could look at my too-much-bacon toe. Different paths, man, different paths. None more righteous than the other. And I hadnâ€™t been to a doctor in a long time. And so, since I was there, I tried to alley-oop it into a physical. Which isâ€“like, you could schedule a physical, but when youâ€™re just trying to ask, like, youâ€™re just putting your shoe back on like, â€œAlso, can we, like, look at other things? Check other stuff?â€ â€œYeah, weâ€™ll do, like, blood pressure.â€ â€œNo, no, no, likeâ€¦ â€œallâ€“all of it. â€œLike, at stuff, can we look atâ€“ â€œCan we look in stuff? â€œCan we look inâ€“up stuff? â€œCan we spread some things apart to squint at other things? â€œWhat Iâ€™m saying is, â€œget extra batteries for that little flashlight, â€œâ€™cause I need a full 15-point diagnostic inspection, is what I need.â€
And to her credit, sheâ€“ We did the full physical when I was there, and to her credit, she transitioned into the testicular exam portion of the physical smoother than any physician I have ever had. It was so smooth, like, I didnâ€™t even realize it happened. â€˜Cause, I mean, obviously, thatâ€™s an awkward thing. It should be awkward. Even though itâ€™s a professional, it should be awkward. Youâ€™re exposing your genitals to a stranger in the daytime for money. You shouldnâ€™t be at ease with that scenario, especially if one of you isnâ€™t a doctor. Thatâ€™s a crime. You know, you shouldnâ€™t beâ€“ you should be a little bit like, â€œAh, okayâ€¦â€ You know? And I can only imagineâ€“ I felt bad for her, being a female doctor, how many guys she had to deal with, just these undercover creeps that, like, function out in the world, but theyâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™ll crack a joke to lighten the mood.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œI need to check your testicles.â€ â€œI thought youâ€™d never ask, blaugh!â€ Get out of here, you sex criminals. Fucking sickos. And it goes the other way too. Doctors can be creeps too. I was in my 20s. Probably the last physical I had, I was in my 20s, and I had an old man doctor, the type of age doctors are supposed to be, just old, and just checking their own pulse to see if theyâ€™re gonna live through the appointment. You know, just old. And, like, Iâ€™m getting a physical, and he goes, â€œAll right, Iâ€™m gonna check your wiener now.â€ No, youâ€™re not, no, no, youâ€™re not. Did you say wiener? Did you say wiener? You thousand-year-old pervert. You just saidâ€“you called a part of my anatomy a wiener? You donâ€™t get this. You donâ€™t deserve this, and you donâ€™t get this, you pedophile. And I know youâ€™re like, if youâ€™re in your 20s, thatâ€™s not what pedophiles are looking for. Yeah, but I always shave my head, and when I have no beard, I look like Charlie Brown became a real boy and got into pills. So Iâ€™m still a sweet, sweet treat for those creeps. But sheâ€“ She transitioned into it smoother than any doctor I could even hope for, because I was sitting there, and Iâ€™m freaking out about the gout thing. And I was like, â€œMaybe I just got gout last week,â€ which is, I didnâ€™t know how you got it. Itâ€™s from years of abuse. I was like, well, I was back home, and I was eating all the junk food I would normally eat back home, but I was eating twice as much of it, â€™cause maybe I knew there was gonna be a sea change happening to my body. So maybe thatâ€™s what I did, â€™cause I was doubling down on all the crap that I like to eat. I was back here, and I was at my favorite hot dog place twice in one shift. Not even in a day, in a shift. Thatâ€™s a four-hour timeframe, â€™cause hot dog employees are part-time employees. Theyâ€™re not there for eight hours. Thatâ€™s four hours, I was back there. I should have just eaten the food in the revolving door in front of the place, just eating it with my chili dog hands on the glass, just eating cheese fries like, â€œWell, Iâ€™m pretty much gonna break even â€œburning calories if I just stay in here. â€œI think I might lose weight doing this. â€œTrish, hit me! Nice!â€ And then just stay, like some sort of slob aquarium twirling around in front of the place. But then, my doctor jumps in. Sheâ€™s like, â€œKyle, you donâ€™t have to tell me about eating junk food when you go back home.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m from Philadelphia. I go nuts on cheesesteaks when Iâ€™m back there.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m a doctor. I should know better than that.â€ I interrupt her, Iâ€™m like, â€œHave you been to this cheesesteak place down on Sunset here?â€ â€˜Cause my doctorâ€™s in L.A. Iâ€™m like, â€œHave you been to this place? Is it authentic? â€œI want to know if itâ€™s authentic, because I like it, but is it the real deal?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œKyle, itâ€™s great. â€œI go in there, they import the bread. â€œThatâ€™s important. They get the imported bread. â€œThatâ€™s good. And they do the provolone. â€œI donâ€™t mess around with that Whiz. â€œI get the provolone on there. Kyle, thatâ€™s an authentic place, if you want to know about it.â€ Iâ€™m telling her, Iâ€™m like, â€™cause Iâ€™ve been to Philadelphia, and I went to those places youâ€™re supposed to go to, that are across the street from one another, and theyâ€™re on all the TV shows, and they were terrible. I got to be honest, those places were trash. My doctor interrupts me, sheâ€™s like, â€œI hate it when people go to my hometown â€œand they think that those are cheesesteaks. â€œThose are garbage cheesesteaks, Kyle. â€œYou want a halfway decent cheesesteak, â€œyou wanna at least go to Jimâ€™s on South Street for a halfway decent cheesesteak.â€ But then she goes, â€œBut you want to know the thing here? â€œKyle, the real sandwich of Philadelphia isnâ€™t a cheesesteak.â€ At this point, Iâ€™m like, â€œDo tell.â€ Oh, weâ€™re gonna do sandwich secrets? Okay, all right. You want to bump some appointments? â€˜Cause if weâ€™re gonna talk sandwiches, Iâ€™ll hang out. Iâ€™ll stay here for another two hours, knock out my deductible, if weâ€™re gonna talk sandwiches. And then she told me, in just a very just knowledgeable, almost secretive way, sheâ€™s like, â€œKyle, the real sandwich of Philadelphia, â€œwhat you want to do, â€œyou want to find the Reading Terminal Market. â€œThatâ€™s what you want to find, Kyle. â€œItâ€™s the Reading Terminal Market. â€œYouâ€™re gonna go downstairs. â€œItâ€™s gonna be a very busy marketplace. â€œDonâ€™t get distracted. â€œYouâ€™re gonna look for a place called DiNicâ€™s. â€œThatâ€™s the place you want to find. â€œNow, when you get to DiNicâ€™s, thereâ€™s other menu items. â€œDo not get distracted by the other menu items. â€œWhat you want to order, itâ€™s a roasted pork sandwich â€œwith broccoli rabe on top of it. â€œItâ€™s a roasted pork sandwich. â€œTake off your pants. â€œIâ€™m gonna check your testicles. Broccoli rabeâ€¦â€ Iâ€™ve never been hypnotized before. And, therefore, didnâ€™t believe it was real. Itâ€™s real, because thatâ€™s what happened right there. Because I didnâ€™t hear her, but I did exactly what she said. Itâ€™s like, â€œYou get the broccoli rabeâ€¦â€ I was like, â€œI had that sandwich. â€œI had that sandwich. I went there. â€œI went there, and no offense, first off, â€œI went there and there was a line. â€œI had to wait in line for food. â€œThis isnâ€™t Russia. â€œMy friend waited. â€œI paid, he waited, if Iâ€™m being completely honest with you. â€œHe had the patience, I had the deep pockets. â€œWhatâ€“yeah, okay. â€œAnd, yeah, so he wouldâ€“ â€œBut I got to tell you, â€œwe had it, and no offense, it was okay. â€œThe pork was very good, but the broccoli was bitter, â€œand it distracted from the flavor of the pork. â€œThatâ€™s my honest opinâ€“ [coughing] â€œIt distracted from the flavor of the pork. â€œAnd I donâ€™tâ€“yeah, no offense to you. â€œIt was okay, it was okay, â€œbut it wasnâ€™t the best thing I had. â€œI did have one of those Jimâ€™s. â€œThat was a good sandwich over at Jimâ€™s. â€œI did like that Jimâ€™s. â€œThat was a good sandwich at Jimâ€™s. â€œWhatâ€™s okay? â€œMy testicles? â€œWait, whatâ€“what? â€œWait, whoaâ€“that was the thing? â€œYou just did it? â€œHo-ho, shit, look at you. â€œOh, youâ€™re a professional. â€œLet me see if my walletâ€™s still in my pants. â€œThat was smooth. â€œYou are a profeâ€“ â€œIâ€™m giving you five stars on, like, an Angieâ€™s List, â€œor wherever I can. â€œI mean, I wonâ€™t be specific, â€œbut Iâ€™ll be like, sheâ€™s professional. Oh, wow.â€ Just living with my disease now. Just living with it. Itâ€™s tough. Thereâ€™s not a lot of awareness out there for it. Thereâ€™s no ribbons. Thereâ€™s certainly not a walk for it.
[laughter]
[applause]
Itâ€™d be condescending, you know? I feel very fortunate that I get to do this, â€™cause itâ€™s not a real thing. Like, real in, you know, the three-dimensional sense that weâ€™re here. Mostly conscious. Canâ€™t speak for some of you in the back.
man: Yeah.
[laughter]
Prove my point. But itâ€™s not likeâ€“ this isnâ€™t a skill, you know? Itâ€™s a nice thing, but itâ€™s not a skill. Itâ€™s not a skill in the sense that itâ€™s necessary for the world. Like, if the shit goes down, my job disappears, you know? So itâ€™s nice, but itâ€™s not a necessity. You donâ€™t hear the apocalypse purveyors and the doomsday preppers who are out in the forest trying to disguise an abandoned school bus on the side of a hill, you never hear them saying something like, â€œTrish, Trish! â€œBefore you finish pickling those yams, â€œwe must go into the city center and lure us back a clown.â€ â€œBecause in addition to preserved foods and fresh water, â€œwe must also be able to ensure that we can tee-hee while society crumbles around us.â€ Thatâ€™s not what this is. All this is, is a personality trait Iâ€™m trying to capitalize on. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s it. You ever meet a comedian with an ego, kick him to the curb. You donâ€™t get to have an ego. All this is, is just somebody was like, â€œHey, man, you were pretty funny at that party last weekend.â€ Iâ€™m just like, â€œYeah, you want to give me 20 bucks?â€ Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m trying to say, is, thanks, chumps. Kidding, joke, itâ€™s a joke.
Chicago, thank you so much for coming to my show. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Have a good night.
[cheers and applause]

[crowd cheering]
Hi! [crowd continues cheering] How we doing? [chuckling] Hey. Hi. Nice to see you. Oh my God. This is the best. Thank you so much for being here. Whatâ€™sâ€¦ Uhâ€¦ Okay. [laughs] I have so much to tell you, genuinely. Umâ€¦ What is everybodyâ€™s name? Should we just startâ€¦ On the count of three, everybody say your name. Ready? One, two, three.
[crowd yelling names indistinctly]
Hello, uh, Iâ€™m Mae. Iâ€™m so pumped to be in Canada right now.
Just, I reallyâ€¦
[crowd cheering] Um, Iâ€¦ I am Canadian.
Iâ€™m very Canadian.
[scattered whoops]
But, please, Iâ€™ve been living in England for the past 12 years. Iâ€™ve been living in London. So I do sound a bit like an asshole. I do have a slight, like, Madonna lilt. And Iâ€™m trying so hard to fight it. Iâ€™m really sorry. But itâ€™sâ€¦ My dadâ€™s British. Like veryâ€¦ Heâ€™s very, very British. Heâ€™s likeâ€¦ My dadâ€™s like a mystical British gentleman. Heâ€™s veryâ€¦ Heâ€™s a magical man. Heâ€™s very into, like, the phases of the moon. Heâ€™sâ€¦ Heâ€™s a moon man. Heâ€™s into, like, umâ€¦ He knows all the birds that ever visit his garden and he has a specific relationship with each bird. And my childhood, like my whole childhood, was pretty mystical. Like, the best example I can think ofâ€¦ Okay, when I was about eight years old, my dad was driving my brother and I to karate class. And it was a very Canadian scene. Itâ€™s like 5:00 p.m., the sunâ€™s already going down. Itâ€™s snowing, weâ€™re on the highway. Weâ€™re going to the karate dojo. Me and my brother in the backseat. Iâ€™m eight, my brotherâ€™s 12. I was a green belt in karate, my brother was a yellow belt. So he was four years older, two belts lower. Umâ€¦ Which is not important, but I thought I would flag it. And, uh, weâ€™re driving along the highway and suddenly my dad, like, swerves to the side of the highway in, like, a panicked move. And tires are screeching, people are honking. Really dangerous. He pulls over, and heâ€™s really shaken up, and he goes, [British accent] â€œIâ€™m so sorry, children, but we have to get out of the car.â€ [regular accent] Weâ€™re like, â€œWhat?â€ And so we get out of the car. Weâ€™re standing by the side of the highway, in the snow. My brother, 12 years old, so embarrassed, heâ€™s like, in his karate uniform. And people are driving by, theyâ€™re like, â€œIs he a yellow belt? â€˜Causeâ€¦â€ â€œHang on a second. He looks olderâ€¦â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna turn the car around. Check this out.â€ And so weâ€™re like, â€œWhat is going on?â€ And my dad goes, â€œIâ€™ve just seen the new moon through glass.â€ So, he had seen the sliver of the new moon through the windshield and we had to pull over, get out of the car, and he made us bow to the moon three times. We had to do this whole ritual. We had to say, â€œGood evening, Lady Moon.â€ It wasâ€¦ It was mystical. Heâ€™s a moon man. Heâ€™s deep into the moon. And, um, I was just visiting recently, uh, visiting home. This is my childhood home that I grew up in, and theyâ€™ve had it since long before I was born. And Iâ€™m in the kitchen with my mom and dad, and my dad comes up to me and goes, â€œMeet me in the study at dusk.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBut Iâ€¦â€ I go to my mom, Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat time is dusk?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ [laughs] And I go up to the study, which is likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s been many things over the years, itâ€™s been like a spare room or whatever. My dadâ€™s there with a glass of wine, looking out the window. He wanted to show me thereâ€™s a family of raccoons that lives in a tree in the neighborâ€™s yard. And, like, every night at dusk, they emerge, and heâ€™s got, yeah, a relationship with them all. Umâ€¦ So, weâ€™re standing, waiting for the raccoons, and he just really dreamily goes, umâ€¦ â€œDo you know you were conceived in this room?â€ Whichâ€¦ So I was like, â€œOhâ€¦â€ And I donâ€™t like to shut him down when heâ€™s being vulnerable, soâ€¦ I was like, â€œWait. You remember the specific night that I was conceived?â€ And he said this phrase, which truly has haunted me ever since. He said, he goes, â€œYes, of course I remember it.â€ â€œI remember it well.â€ This is what he said. â€œThe moonlight shone in over your motherâ€™s bottom.â€
[crowd gasps, laughs]
Over yourâ€¦ I feel like youâ€™re not fully getting, likeâ€¦ I now know the position I was conceived in. Iâ€™m horrified. Nobody wants to be conceived doggy style. Itâ€™s so bleak. You donâ€™t wantâ€¦ You want to be conceived face to face. Eye contact. At the moment of ejaculation, just like weâ€¦ â€œWeâ€™re making a choice to make a life.â€ Not like, â€œAh! Bite the pillow!â€ Itâ€™s horrible. Itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s bleak. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s changed how I see myself. Like, how Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m a doggy-style baby.â€
[crowd laughing]
Makes a lot of sense, actually. Explains a lot. Itâ€™s, like, affected my posture. Iâ€™m just a little moreâ€¦ Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ Just a little hunched. [laughs] I feel like I can spot other doggy-style babies when Iâ€™m out in the world, 100%, thereâ€™sâ€¦ Iâ€™ll be getting on the subway, and thereâ€™s someoneâ€¦ [grunting] Smoking on the subway. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, yeah.â€ Or Iâ€™ll be in a bar, and the bartenderâ€™s like, â€œSorry, someoneâ€™s just sent you a drink.â€ I look down the bar, andâ€¦ [grunting] Another doggy-style baby. Thereâ€™s some in here tonight. I can see us. Several. [Mae laughs] Theyâ€¦ Every time I go home to visit, something like this happens. Something that derails myâ€¦ my grasp on reality. Like, um, okay, my parents have this anecdote, and itâ€™s a story theyâ€™ve been telling my whole life. Like, once a year, theyâ€™ll have a few drinks and tell this story at a dinner party or whatever. Umâ€¦ And it makes me feel crazy, because Iâ€™m like, â€œIt cannot be true.â€ So, why are you doing this to me? What is this? Um, and my brother and I get really upset. Iâ€™ll tell you the story and then you can be the judge, if you think itâ€™s true or not. Okay?
[audience whoops]
Okay. So, my parents swear that when they were in their late twenties, they were driving through Northern Ontario, down a winding road through a forest, and they drove under a moose.
[crowd laughing]
[scoffs] They swear. They swear. My mom says they were driving down this winding road, the moose was horizontal on the road, and they drove under its belly. It makes me feel insane. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ Itâ€™sâ€¦ And so itâ€™sâ€¦ [laughs] She does a sound effect of the sound of the belly fur of the moose gently grazing the roof of the car. Just likeâ€¦ [whooshes softly] Can you imagine? It makes me feel insane. It makes me feel crazy. And, uh, it makes my brother irate, as well. Becauseâ€¦ So, the last time I was visiting, me and my brother were like, â€œWe need to get to the bottom of this.â€ We need to find out if this is even possible. So we did research and we found out the height of a Toyota Tercel. Thatâ€™s the car they were driving. So, the height of the roof of the car. We Googled the largest ever recorded moose. And the infuriating thing is it could just have happened. It could just have happened. If they happened to stumble upon the biggest-ever recorded moose, I guess itâ€™s possible. It makes me feel insane. [sighs] You think itâ€™s true? Give a cheer if you think itâ€™s true.
[crowd cheering]
Really? Give a cheer if you think itâ€™s bullshit.
[loud cheering]
See? I donâ€™t know. I think it says a lot about your worldview. Like, if you believe in the moose, youâ€™re young at heart. Youâ€¦ Youâ€™ve retained a sliver of, like, childlike enthusiasm about life. And if you donâ€™t believe in the moose, youâ€™reâ€¦ Look, itâ€™s been a tough couple years. Itâ€™s been tough, hasnâ€™t it? Oh my God. It really has. We got to do whatever it takes to get by. You know? Whatever makes you feel good. Likeâ€¦ So my father sent me a news article recently. Uh, he sent me this news article, and was like, â€œI thought youâ€™d like this.â€ â€œI thought youâ€™d relate to it.â€ Those are the words he used. â€œI thought youâ€™d really relate to this.â€ This was the story, and I havenâ€™t stopped thinking about it. Iâ€™m going to tell it to you. So this, it happened in the Netherlands, in a small town in the Netherlands, where basically this family noticed that they werenâ€™t getting any mail. They were like, â€œWe havenâ€™t received any mail in a long time.â€ Weeks start going by. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWait. Weâ€™re not even getting our bills or pamphlets in the mail. This is really weird.â€ So they go to their neighbors. â€œAre you guys getting your mail?â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œNo. This is so weird. Not for so long.â€ So they go to the post office and speak to, like, the boss. The mail boss, you know. [chuckling] You know, the mail bossâ€¦ that you have to defeat to pass Level 10. [laughs] Heâ€™s likeâ€¦ [growls] And, umâ€¦ Theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™re not getting any of our mail.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ll look into it.â€ He goes to speak to the mailman whoâ€™s responsible for that block. And I canâ€™t remember the mailmanâ€™s name, so weâ€™ll call him likeâ€¦ Gary. Weâ€™ll call him Gary. Heâ€™s like, â€œGary, these people are saying that theyâ€™re not getting their mail.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s going on?â€ And Garyâ€™s like weirdly defensive right away. Heâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know what to tell you. I deliver the mail.â€ â€œIf theyâ€™re not getting mail, it means no oneâ€™s writing to them.â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œOkay.â€ So the mail boss is like, â€œOkay, Gary.â€ But privately, to his coworkers, heâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s up with Gary?â€ Gary is being really weird. So they decide theyâ€™re going to keep an eye on Gary and investigate the sitch. And so, the next day, Gary comes to work and first red flag, he picks up the mail and gets in his personal vehicle. Not the mail truck or whatever. Gets in hisâ€¦ And he drives out of town. So theyâ€™re like, â€œFuck.â€ And they followed him. They follow him, and he drives into the forest in the Netherlands. And they follow him at a distance. They watch him park. They park. Theyâ€™re keeping an eye on him. They see him get out of the car. He takes the bag of mail, he goes into the woods, heâ€™s gone 45 minutes. He comes back out with no bag. Gets in his car, drives away. So they go in after him. Into the forest. Andâ€¦ Imagine this. This is the sight theyâ€™re confronted with, okay? Beautiful, dappled sunlight, you know. Mist rising from the moss. Thereâ€™s a lone moose. A huge moose in the background. Just towering over the trees, truly. Umâ€¦ [laughs] And they see, as far as the eye can see, there are hundreds of piles of freshly turned earth. Littleâ€¦ In neat rows stretching through the forest. And they dust, they brush the dirt up. Garyâ€™s been burying the mail. Heâ€™s been burying the mail for ages. This has obviously been going on a long time and itâ€™s now amped up. Theyâ€™re like, â€œFuck.â€ And, uhâ€¦ They approach him the next day at work. Gently. They approach him gently. Theyâ€™re like, â€œHey, Gar. Umâ€¦â€ [clicks tongue] â€œIâ€¦â€ â€œWe noticed youâ€™ve been burying the mail.â€ â€œAnd we were just wondering, why are you doing that?â€ And in the news article, this was the direct quote from the mailman, in answer to the question, â€œWhy are you burying the mail?â€ This is what he said. He said, â€œI did it once, it felt good.â€ â€œAnd now itâ€™s just kind of what I do.â€ I love him. Heâ€™s my hero, Iâ€¦ Guys, Gary went to jail. He went to jail for eight months. Yeah. You canâ€™t fuck with the mail, thatâ€™s a federal offense. Umâ€¦ He went to jail. And I wanted to write him fan mail in jail, but I donâ€™t want to stress him out. â€˜Cause heâ€™d be like, â€œI want to bury it. Argh!â€ [laughs] But, no, I really was, likeâ€¦ Iâ€™ve never felt so seen by my father. Umâ€¦ Thatâ€™sâ€¦ [chuckles] It has been tough. Like, Iâ€™m trying to get back into life and sort of feel that enthusiasm again of pre-pandemic life. Especially, Iâ€™m struggling to feel that enthusiasm in my romantic life. I donâ€™t know if anyone is in the same boat.
[scattered cheers]
But post-pandemic dating, like, Iâ€™mâ€¦ â€˜Cause Iâ€™m 35, likeâ€¦ In my early 20s, so romantic. Obsessed with finding â€œthe one.â€ My parents are very in love and that was my model. So I justâ€¦ Somebody would be, â€œDo you have the time?â€ And Iâ€™d be, â€œI love you as well.â€ Is thatâ€¦ â€œAnd Iâ€¦â€ â€œAnd I want to go with you.â€ [awkward laugh] â€œWhere are we going?â€ Um, and now Iâ€™m just a bit likeâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. Last summer, I dated someone. A man, actually, a lovely man, if you can believe. Not if youâ€¦ Wait, not if youâ€¦ Not â€œif you can believe that men can be lovely.â€ Of course they can. But if you can believe that Iâ€¦ Umâ€¦ Yeah, so we dated for like six months, me and this guy and, uhâ€¦ You know it was really nice, but Iâ€™m 35, heâ€™s 36. Like, at this point, we both have big exes in our past. You know what I mean? Weâ€™re never going to be that big ex for each other. Like, weâ€™re never gonna properly traumatize each other, so itâ€™s kind of likeâ€¦ Whatâ€™s the point? Umâ€¦
[audience laughter]
Andâ€¦ [laughs] So, we were in bed one night, and we were just chatting, we were having a nice light-hearted chat. He wasnâ€™t trying to be heavy. He just goes, â€œIf we had kids one day, what would we name our kids?â€ I was, like, â€œI donâ€™tâ€¦â€ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ At this point, Iâ€™ve had that conversation with so many people. I was likeâ€¦ [sighs] â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ â€œLet me just wade through this graveyard of dead hypothetical children to try to get to the new hypothetical kids.â€ Iâ€™m passing the ghosts of â€™em. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, look!â€ â€œThereâ€™s Olive and Basil, the twins.â€ [laughs] Theyâ€™re there. Theyâ€™re like, â€œYou forgot about us.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, fuck off.â€ Thereâ€™s little Clementine, I sent her to a private school. You know? Sheâ€™s got a clarinet through her head. [in childâ€™s voice] â€œCome and play with me.â€ [regular voice] Iâ€™m like, â€œNo.â€ [chuckling] And I finally find the new hypothetical children, Iâ€™m like, â€œI have no creative energy left to name these children.â€ Like, â€œCan we just call them both Ian?â€ I donâ€™t know. Did you guys know thatâ€¦? This is true. In 2018, there were no new Ianâ€™s born. There were noâ€¦ Itâ€™s a true story. In 2018, not a single new Ian registered on this planet Earth. That is true. And if youâ€™re watching this, and you hate the show, at least take that with you. You know? Wait, so do you guys know what I mean when I say big ex?
Like, you have your exes.
[scattered cheering]
Okay. Really? Youâ€™re like, â€œYes, we know.â€ Like you have your normal exes and then you have, like, your big exes. Where you reach a certain page in the novel of your lifeâ€¦ No. Uh, I do feel you reach a certain age and you just have to accept that for the rest of your life thereâ€™s certain names, where every time you hear them, all of your organs are gonna dissolve. And just fall out of your vagina. Or your bum hole, if you donâ€™tâ€¦ And you have to carry around a plastic bag just in case you have to collect yourâ€¦ [laughs] Itâ€™s disgusting. Umâ€¦ So, I have a couple of significant big exes, but I have this one whoâ€¦ I want to tell you this story. So basically, this ex, it was a really intense relationship, it was like four years. And it was a secret relationship because it was her first non-heterosexual relationship. She was like, â€œWe canâ€™t tell anyone.â€ And we lived together. It was so stressful. And she broke up with me, which is not allowed. Umâ€¦ Whichâ€¦ I thought I had made that clear. [chuckles] Umâ€¦ It was a long, drawn-out break-up. Anyway, so at the point where this story takes place, I hadnâ€™t seen her in a year and a half or had any contact. I was in London and I was doing a show, and I was feeling good that night. You know what I mean? Like, I had a fresh haircut. I was freshly shorn. You know the feeling? I was wearing a crisp black T-shirt andâ€¦ [laughs] Crisper than this. Iâ€™m sorry about this. This isâ€¦ crumpled. Crumplestiltskin over here. [laughing] Do you remember Rumpelstiltskin?
[crowd cheering]
What happened to him? He used to be everywhere. We used to always talk about him. When youâ€™re a kid, Rumpelstiltskin this, Rumpelstiltskinâ€¦ Now you never hear about him. I get it. Itâ€™s hard to stay relevant. You know? Heâ€™s, like, faded into obscurity. Anyway, so Iâ€™m feeling good on this particular night, feeling crisp. Feeling shorn, and, uhâ€¦ And also my best friend Joe was with me that night. He was in the audience of my show. I love having Joe in the audience, heâ€™s a generous laugher. Heâ€™s a real angel, like, my best, best friend. And, um, I do the show, it goes well. And I go to the green room afterwards. Out the green room door to meet Joe. And Iâ€™mâ€¦ It was a good show. Iâ€™m like, â€œHey, man. Fun show.â€ But heâ€™s like green. Just all the color has left his face, and he just goes, â€œSheâ€™s here.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck.â€ I know exactly who he means right away, so Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay.â€ And he goes, â€œLook, sheâ€™s upstairs.â€ â€œShe doesnâ€™t know youâ€™re in the building. She came to the bar to have a drink with some of our mutual friends.â€ He goes, â€œLetâ€™s just sneak out the back.â€ â€œLetâ€™s have a fun night. Weâ€™ll go to a different bar.â€ And I thought about it. And then I thought, â€œNo.â€ â€œI donâ€™t want to have a fun night.â€ So, Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, weâ€™ll go upstairs.â€ We go up, Iâ€™m feeling confident. I see, there she is with our mutual friends and, umâ€¦ You guys would have been very proud of me. I walk over very cool. [laughs] What does that mean? I walk overâ€¦ Uhâ€¦ Umâ€¦ No, I walk over feeling confident. Andâ€¦ Iâ€™m alsoâ€¦ I have the element of surprise. She doesnâ€™t know Iâ€™m in the building. I think this is gonna work in my favor. So I walk over, go, â€œHey.â€ Our mutual friends, they all know how bad the breakup was by this point, so they see me coming. I go, â€œHey, howâ€™s it going?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œOh my God, hi.â€ She stands up. We hug. Itâ€™s really nice. I go, â€œGreat to see you.â€ â€œHey, I heard you got that part, thatâ€™s so great.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œYeah. Congrats on stuff.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, great.â€ Itâ€™s going well, and I suddenly think, â€œYou know what, I need to be the one to end this interaction.â€ Right? I need to retain control of the situation. Like, I need toâ€¦ We talked for a while, and I go, â€œListen, so good to see youâ€¦â€ She goes, â€œYou want to sit down?â€ Iâ€™m, â€œNo, no, Iâ€™m gonna hang with my friends at the bar, but itâ€™s really nice to see you.â€ We hug again, she sits down. Iâ€™m walking to the bar and sheâ€™s still kinda casting glances over her shoulder as I walk to the bar. And, as Iâ€™m walking to the bar, I suddenly realize, â€œWhat friends at the bar?â€ There are no friends at the bar. Joe has sat down at her table. Heâ€™s a snake. Heâ€™s dead to me. Iâ€™m panicking â€™cause sheâ€™s still kinda looking. And Iâ€™m walking to the bar. Thank God, at the last second, I see three girls who were in my show. They were in the front row of my show. So Iâ€™m approaching the bar, thank God, one of them goes, â€œHey, great show tonight.â€ So I thinkâ€¦ I think probably what she wanted out of that interaction, like, what she expected from that interaction, was kind of like, â€œHey. Great show tonight.â€ â€œOh, cheers, thanks for coming.â€ What she got was so intense. I was like, â€œHi, how are you? What are all of your names and jobs?â€ So tactile as well. Weirdly tactile. Like my arm around all their shoulders, like my head on their shoulder. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ Mm! [laughs] Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhoa, okay. Uhâ€¦â€ Weâ€™re chatting. Then, thank God, we start chatting, itâ€™s going well, weâ€™re getting along. So Iâ€™m like, â€œCrisis averted.â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œYou want a drink?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah.â€ Weâ€™re having a drink and I suddenly feel a tap on my shoulder, and I look around and itâ€™s my big ex. This time she has the element of surprise, because I wasnâ€™t expecting it. She goes, â€œHey, sorry to interrupt, I want to say bye, Iâ€™m leaving now.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, yeah.â€ And we hug. And she said something awful, likeâ€¦ Likeâ€¦ â€œIâ€™m sure our paths will cross one day.â€ You know what I mean? Something like that, where all my organs dissolve. Get the plastic bag out. Oh God. Umâ€¦ [laughs] And so we hug, and sheâ€™s leaving, she turns. Sheâ€™s still kind of saying goodbye to some people here, and I turn back to my â€œfriends,â€ and suddenly, like, I guess I just got overwhelmed. And the floodgates just open and I just start sobbing. Soâ€¦ No, my face like crumbles, my shouldersâ€¦ Iâ€™m literally just likeâ€¦ [sobs] Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh my God, are you okay?â€ And I just go, â€œLaugh, laugh!â€ [sobs] â€œLaugh!â€ It was psychotic behavior. Iâ€™m literally like, â€œFucking laugh. Ah!â€ [sobs] And theyâ€™re all likeâ€¦ â€œHa-ha-ha-ha.â€ [laughs] [sighs] Thereâ€™s no real punchline to that story, itâ€™s justâ€¦ a vignette, if you will. To illustrate the level of emotion Iâ€™m operating on. I meanâ€¦ I have a lot of feelings. Do you guys have a lot of feelings?
[crowd whooping, clapping]
Itâ€™s exhausting, you know. Iâ€™m full to the absolute brim with feelings. I always visualize, umâ€¦ like Campbellâ€™s tomato soup. That itâ€™sâ€¦ You know what I mean? Campbellâ€™s cream of tomato soup. And then Iâ€™m full to brim. Right to the top of my skull, just trying to keep it contained. Just trying to keep it from sloshing out of my orifices as I make my way through life. Thatâ€™s how I feel about my feelings. All it takes is one person goes, â€œHow are you?â€ And itâ€™s likeâ€¦ fling! Like, it shoots out my ear. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh God.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€ [sobbing] [sadly] â€œThatâ€™s not about you.â€ [chuckles] No, Iâ€™m all right. I got a therapist recently.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[crowd cheering]
Yeah, you have to, guys. You do. Likeâ€¦ Well, if youâ€™re gonna complain as much as I complain, unfortunately, you do have to get one. Umâ€¦ Yeah. I feel like my friends were starting to be like, â€œYou should pay someone to do what you expect of us.â€ I was like, â€œOh, okay.â€ I found this therapist and heâ€™s really smart and we Zoom. And he said something interesting where he said, â€œRemember, you are not the feeling.â€ â€œSure you feel consumed by the feeling, but you are not the feeling.â€ He said, â€œWithin you, and within everyone, thereâ€™s a very still, neutral, eternal self.â€ â€œAnd you experience the feelings, but youâ€™re not consumed by them.â€ He said, â€œRather than identifying so much with the feeling, like, â€˜Iâ€™m anxious, Iâ€™m this.'â€ He said, â€œDonâ€™t be consumed by the feeling.â€ â€œJust observe the feelings as they come, with curiosity.â€ Have you heard that before? Apparently thatâ€™s theâ€¦ So I think youâ€™re just supposed to be like, â€œHuh.â€ â€œIâ€™m experiencing rage.â€ â€œHow curious.â€ â€œHow curious.â€ [laughs] I had a really, um, weird thing where, during the pandemicâ€¦ I spent the whole pandemic in London. I was just in my apartment, in the rain, in London forâ€¦ years. [laughs] And, uh, I noticed an unexpected feeling bubbling up where I was, â€œWhy do I feel embarrassed?â€ Like, I would wake up feeling embarrassed. And I was spending a lot of time, obviously, in my apartment. in my living room, and in my bedroom, specifically. And I was like, â€œWait, okay, maybe itâ€™s this.â€ Okay, stay with me. Donâ€™t you think itâ€™s kind of embarrassing that weâ€™re adults and we still have rooms? Okay, stay, wait. That weâ€™re like, â€œThis is my room. Hm.â€ â€œThis is my room.â€ â€œDonâ€™t go in my room.â€ [laughs] Itâ€™s embarrassing. â€œI have to clean my room.â€ And, like, please. I, of course, accept and understand that we need rooms. You need four walls within which to lay your weary head each night. But I think what I find so embarrassing about it is, like, the way we decorate our rooms to reflect our individuality. And weâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m me.â€ Right? â€œIâ€™m myself in my room.â€ Itâ€™s so embarrassing. â€œI have one Himalayan salt lamp.â€ â€œYes I do, and Iâ€™m me.â€ â€œI have my picture on the wall and Iâ€¦â€ When you finish reading a book, you never get rid of it. Youâ€™re like, â€œI put it on the shelf in myâ€¦â€ â€œThat is my personality on display for all to see.â€ [chuckles] â€œNo one else is me.â€ And then I was thinkingâ€¦ Okay, this is a little abstract, but donâ€™t you think, in a way, our brains and our minds are like our rooms, and we furnish our minds with experiences that we collect to then build what we think of as our identity and selves? And thatâ€™s all weâ€™re doing. Weâ€™re little experience hunters, collecting these to put them on our brain shelves and be like, â€œIâ€™m me.â€ And I always visualize every experience that we collect is like a little novelty snow globe. Weâ€™re just going around, being like, â€œOne time I saw Antonio Banderas at the airport. Yes, I did.â€ â€œIâ€™m myself. And no one else is me.â€ [laughs] And then all human interaction is, reallyâ€¦ I really noticed this coming out of the pandemic. All interaction is just basically taking turns showing each other our snow globes. And being like, â€œIâ€¦â€ And just pathetically taking turns. And, like, someone will be showing you their snow globe, you know, and youâ€™re trying to be a good listener. Itâ€™s a story about a party they went to five years ago. And youâ€™re like, â€œYes, and you are you as well.â€ Like, â€œYes, exactly, yes.â€ â€œHow wonderful to be yourself as well.â€ But the whole time, your eyes are darting to your own shelf. A hundred percent, the whole timeâ€¦ Youâ€™re like, â€œMmm, yes. Well, no. Yes.â€ Waiting for your moment to be like, â€œAnd me as well. I have oneâ€¦â€
[laughs]
[crowd cheering]
Thank you. This is so exciting. You know what? I was thinkingâ€¦ Well, I watch a lot of stand-up specials. Then my friendâ€™s special came out recently, and they put out the trailer. I was like, â€œFuck, itâ€™s so dynamic.â€ Like, sheâ€™s so physical onstage and doingâ€¦ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t really move much.â€ Like Iâ€™m veryâ€¦ Then I was like, â€œWhat if?â€ â€˜Cause I really want my trailer to be dynamic. So, I was like, â€œWhat if I justâ€¦â€ I know in my head the things I want to see in my trailer. I just havenâ€™t written the jokes that go with the movements. So I was like, â€œMaybe I just do the movements.â€ And then I put it in the trailer and itâ€™s just, likeâ€¦ Just like this. Thatâ€™s in the trailer, how good would that be? Youâ€™d be like, â€œI gotta watch that.â€
[crowd cheering]
I should just have, like, a hundred trained dogs. They all come out on the stage like this. And theyâ€™re all on their hind legs jumping and then we just have it in the trailer and never in the show. [laughs] Umâ€¦ Yeah, feelings. I got a lot of feelings. Soâ€¦ rage, embarrassment. These are some of the feelings. Umâ€¦ Another feeling that Iâ€¦ Itâ€™s very dominant in my life, and I think a lot of people relate to this, itâ€™s, like, nostalgia. Iâ€™m very nostalgic. You know? And I know thatâ€™s kind of a useless emotion, like Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m nostalgic for pre-pandemic times and we didnâ€™t know how good we had it. Iâ€™m very nostalgic, really, for pre-puberty, if Iâ€™m being honest. Thatâ€™s where it all went wrong. Likeâ€¦ Yeah, and my friends are like, â€œOh, yeah. You missed the â€™90s.â€ Thatâ€™s so original. â€œDo you miss how all of our parents used to have a lot of rubber bands?â€ Do you remember how everyone had rubber bands? Youâ€™d find them around drawer handles and shit. Thereâ€™d be a whole ball of them. What were they for? I have no rubber bands now. â€œDo you miss how all parents had one big conch shell in the bathroom?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYes. Yes, I do miss that.â€ Yeah. And I miss the easier access to abortion and less populism.
Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah.
[crowd cheering]
I do feel, I think Iâ€™m someone who I never really got over puberty. Well, for a couple of reasons. I think puberty hit me like a ton of bricks, really. First of all, Iâ€™m exactly the demographic where, um, for me, puberty coincided almost exactly with the arrival of the Internet and the popularization of the Internet. Iâ€™m so lucky. I had, like, one to 13, kind ofâ€¦ It wasnâ€™t around. And I remember the one computer in our classroom got the Internet. And overnight, the world just exploded, everything changed, it was likeâ€¦ We all got our first e-mail addresses. Mine was hot-mae-el@hotmail.com.
[audience laughter]
Thank you. Those were the days you could get the good email addresses. But it was like overnight the world went from being very manageableâ€¦ Everything I needed to know was in just in one set of Encyclopedia Britannicaâ€™s in my parentsâ€™ basement. It was so relaxing. It was like a finite amount of facts. That was it. The nice, thin paper. You know what I mean? It was manageable. It wasnâ€™tâ€¦ Also, it was like objective truth. Like, no one was putting out the devilâ€™s advocate set of encyclopedias. You know what I mean? Like, â€œWellâ€¦â€ â€œAre you sure Lima is the capital of Peru?â€ Umâ€¦ [chuckles] And then overnight it was likeâ€¦ I was obsessed with it. I remember my friends at lunch being like, â€œWeâ€™re gonna go out and play at recess. Wanna come?â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œNo, thereâ€™s so much work to be done on the Internet.â€ â€œThereâ€™s so much going on.â€ I was like, â€œI have to copy and paste images of Buffy the Vampire Slayer into a Word document.â€ I then have to print that Word document. The paper will be sodden with ink. Just heavy with ink. Likeâ€¦ I have to cut those pictures out, and itâ€™s going to be like cutting wet toilet paper. I then have to stick those pictures onto my homework diary. Like, Iâ€™m busy. Iâ€¦ I truly feel like Iâ€™ve been busy ever since. Iâ€™m exhausted. And another reason that I think puberty really hit me was, likeâ€¦ Okay, so, yeah. Regular puberty stuff, then the Internet arrives and the stuff that brings with it. And then for me, also, puberty triggered kind of a wild gender dysphoria and a gender thing.
You know what I mean?
[crowd] Yeah!
[laughs] Uh-huh? Dead silence. Umâ€¦ No, but really, like, before puberty, I felt like I was this bounding, androgynous child, very confident, did a lot of Ace Ventura impersonations. And then suddenly puberty hit and my bodyâ€™s changing, I felt very likeâ€¦ And this was the â€™90s too. This was the era of girl bands and boy bands, right? This was the very pop-fueled binary. And I went to an all-girls school, which I just, likeâ€¦ The ubiquitous question, the question you needed to know an answer to at my school was which Spice Girl are you? And it was like, thereâ€™s only five possible answers. You needed to know. Youâ€™d be in the hall, and a group of girls would corner you, â€œWhich one are you?â€ â€˜Cause theyâ€™re organizing lip-syncs and stuff. They need to know, no judgment. They did need to know where you fit into the constellation. It was like, â€œWhich one are you?â€ And I was like, â€œJustin Timberlake. I donâ€™t know.â€ â€œNick Carter?â€ Umâ€¦ I think, regardless, if you experience gender stuff, puberty anyway is a fucking nightmare. Like, you feel like an alien, and everything that was cool about you just becomes worthless overnight. Like, okay, I had this trick. Okay, well, itâ€™s a noise that I can make with my hand. And I swear, it was really popular. People loved when I did it, it killed at parties. Iâ€™m going to do it for you now. Uhâ€¦ Okay, maybe some of you remember this. Um, okay, this is the noise. [high-pitched vibrating vocalizing of â€œThe Lion Sleeps Tonightâ€] Do you remember that? Guys, I swear, it used to kill at parties. People would request it, theyâ€™d be like, â€œDo the noise.â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œOkay.â€ I did it in a school assembly once. That wasâ€¦ That was too far, but, umâ€¦ It was really cool, and then, all of a sudden puberty hit, suddenly Iâ€™m at a house party, Iâ€™m in a cupboard with a pimply 13-year-old boy whoâ€™s got a semi, and Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [vocalizing â€œThe Lion Sleeps Tonightâ€] And heâ€™s like, â€œWhat the fuck?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œI thought you were gonna give me a hand job.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo.â€ â€œI saidâ€¦ that I could do something cool with my hand.â€
[cheering]
He leaves me alone in the cupboard. Iâ€™m there in the dark by myself, likeâ€¦ [vocalizing â€œMad Worldâ€] Really mournful. [cheering] Itâ€™s hard to live at that age. Itâ€™s reallyâ€¦ I meanâ€¦ Donâ€™t you think that the only way to flirt when youâ€™re 13, the only acceptable way, is to go, â€œHow big are your hands?â€ Thatâ€™sâ€¦ Donâ€™t you think? Do you remember that? â€œHow big are your hands?â€ I still kinda think thatâ€™s a great move to make physical contact with someone that you like. Except I was at my all-girls school, just sort of slightly getting it wrong. â€œYeah, my hands are pretty massive.â€ â€œYeah, yours are tiny, of course.â€ Going around the playground, being like, â€œWell, you know what they say.â€ â€œBig hands, massive labia.â€ [laughs] [exhales] Butâ€¦ So all that was going on, you know? And I think for everyone, at puberty, you do kind ofâ€¦ You develop critical thinking and suddenly, sort of, the hard facts of life are hitting you. I think if youâ€™re, like, different in any way, like, if the dominant narrative thatâ€™s being told to you by everyone doesnâ€™t match what youâ€™re experiencing, know what I mean? Like, with gender, people being like, â€œThereâ€™s two. And youâ€™re a woman and this is what itâ€™s like.â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œOkay.â€ But youâ€™re experiencing something completely different. Then you kind of have two options. You can either question the validity of yourself and your experience or you can question the validity of everything else and the whole system. Once you start pulling that thread, youâ€™re fucked. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Monogamy, youâ€™re likeâ€¦ Can I bring two people to prom? Why not? I donâ€™t get why not. And I really feltâ€¦ And also, likeâ€¦ For me, I, um, I started doing comedy when I was 13 and I discoveredâ€¦ I got really into drugs, like psychedelic drugs. So that just exacerbated the general existential wave. Like I felt like I was peeling back the wallpaper on reality and I was seeing this very flimsy scaffolding holding everything up. I was just like, â€œWhat is going on?â€ You suddenly realize your parents are flawed, your teachers are, like, lonely or something. I remember being, â€œMm, I think Ms. Buchananâ€™s lonely.â€ â€œI feel a huge amount of pressure to laugh at her jokes. And I donâ€™t know.â€ Umâ€¦ And yeah, I remember being really stressed by why donâ€™t we, as a society, talk more about the fact that the movie Antz and the movie A Bugâ€™s Life came out in the same year. Surely, powerful forces are at play here and weâ€™re just not going to address it? Like what theâ€¦ Umâ€¦ Yeah. So, yeah, I was stressed andâ€¦ And also, I think with drugs, it was a way to get out of my body. I was feeling very uncomfortable in my body and it was this trap door. And so I got heavily into drugs, and the bullet points are, I went from psychedelics into, like, the really bad ones. I got kicked out of my house. I dropped out of school. Fast-forward, I ended up in rehab. When I was 19, I went to a rehab day program for nine months. Uhâ€¦ A rehab day program for teens, objectively, a bad idea. Well, in a way, right? Like, you get a group of teenagers together, all they have in common is they love doing drugs. Every day, at 3:00 p.m., the bell goes and theyâ€™re like, â€œOff you go with your new friends.â€ â€œRun along. Bond in the alleyways.â€ â€œThe only way you know how.â€ [laughs] Um, but it was very eye-opening for me. It was a big turning point because I got into this program and there were 12 other kids in there. I was suddenly like, â€œOh, fuck.â€ These kids have come from actually difficult lives, and difficult family situations. Like who am I? You know? Iâ€™m this privileged, middle-class kid. What am I rebelling against, really? But I needed to be there, and it was good. I wanted to fit in with all these kids. Theyâ€™d been there a while, they were all really bonded. And they had nicknames for each other. Iâ€™ve never had a nickname and I wanted to be in on it. I was very excited because after like two months in the program, I came in one morning and one of the guys goes, â€œYo, Bath Water, whatâ€™s up?â€ I was like, â€œBath Water?â€ And they all start calling me Bath Water. Then the teacher starts calling meâ€¦ It catches on. The teachers are, â€œGood morning, Bath Water.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat is happening?â€ But I get into it. I donâ€™t want to admit that I donâ€™t know why theyâ€™re calling me Bath Water. Iâ€™m like, â€œYup. Not much. All good.â€ Yeah. And then finally, I get comfortable enough with them and we all get close. Iâ€™m like, â€œGuys, Iâ€™ve been meaning to ask you for months.â€ â€œWhy do you call me, Bath Water?â€ And they said, â€œOh, itâ€™s because when you arrived, we all had a conversation and decided you look like the type of kid who would drink their own bath water.â€ Itâ€™sâ€¦ so specific. So insulting. And creative, yes. Drink their ownâ€¦ I mean, look, Iâ€™ve drunk some bath water in my time. Sure. Havenâ€™t we all? I mean, not like withâ€¦ [glugs] [laughs] With a straw. Justâ€¦ No, but, like, we allâ€¦ Weâ€™ve all drunk some, havenâ€™t we? Okay, wait. Do you remember bath time? Remember bath time? Did you ever, um, in bath time, take your wet flannelâ€¦ Do you call it a flannel or a facecloth? Flannel? Yeah. Canada, yeah. [laughs] Did you ever take your wet flannel and lie it on your face, and breathe through it? And then you suddenly feel like youâ€™re waterboarding yourself? Youâ€™re like, â€œOh no, God!â€ Or did you ever suck the water out of your flannel? Right? It feels so squeaky on yourâ€¦ What a feeling. Bath time. You know what I mean? Know what I miss most? Iâ€™ll move on from bath time, but I will just quickly say what I miss most about bath time is just once a day, somebody going, â€œUh, itâ€™s bath time.â€ How good is that? I feel like we donâ€™t appreciate it when weâ€™re young, but imagine youâ€™re on a shitty Tinder date, and the waiter comes over, theyâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m so sorry to interrupt. Um, it is bath time for you.â€ Youâ€™re likeâ€¦ Youâ€™d be out of there.
[crowd cheering]
Youth is wasted on the young. You know? Youth is wasted on the young. Umâ€¦ Yeah, so thatâ€™sâ€¦ Yeah. I think the reason that I obsess over my teens, and Iâ€™m constantly processing it, is that I feel like a completely different person now. And I did have this kind of chaotic adolescence, and it was really dark, like it was crazy. Now I feel truly like a completely different person. Like, Iâ€™m very risk averse now. Youâ€¦ Yeah. You should see me on an escalator, itâ€™s insane. I hold so tight to the railing. Iâ€™m very likeâ€¦ [chuckles] As the thingâ€™s approaching, â€œOh my God.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOne, two, three, go.â€ Waiting for my moment. [nervous laugh] If Iâ€™m not ready and itâ€™s coming, Iâ€™m walking backwards. Iâ€™m going, â€œOkayâ€¦â€ â€œOne, twoâ€¦â€ [chuckling] Yeah. Yeah. But I do stillâ€¦ I feel different. I do, I guess, still get that self-destructive feeling. Like, that pressure building up. I feel like we all kind of sometimes have those impulses and you have to find the healthy way to deal with those feelings. Um, I do a lot of escape rooms. Iâ€™m always escaping a room. Constantly. Umâ€¦ Like, I was on tour recently and touring is intense. Also, I tour by myself. I donâ€™t usually have an opening act, or a tour manager, or whatever. I just travel by myself. I have these long days in these random cities in the UK. And I was doing a show in Edinburgh. I was Scotland, in Edinburgh, by myself for the day, and I was having the feeling of pressure building up. You know what I mean? And, like, I had just seen Trainspotting, so I was like, â€œWeâ€™re in the danger zone.â€ And, uh, I said, â€œWhat should I do?â€ So I go online and I found the Edinburgh dungeons were open. Thatâ€™s kind of like the London dungeons, where itâ€™s like this horror, immersive horror experience, where actors dress up like Victorians and scare you. And you walk through a maze of hell. So I was like, â€œGreat.â€ Umâ€¦ And I got the VIP package as well, which is just you pay 20 extra bucks and all it meant was, when I arrived, they take a picture of you in front of a green screen. And then they give you a key and they project a graveyard and give you the keychain of theâ€¦ That was when I was like, â€œOh. This is something you should do with friends.â€ [laughs] Friends or loved ones. I do now have a keychain thatâ€™s justâ€¦ So, I go down and itâ€™s me and this group of strangers and weâ€™re going to go together as a group through this horror maze. Itâ€™s tourists and families, thereâ€™s like ten of us. Weâ€™re about to go through it, and this guy comes out, and heâ€™s dressed like a kind of Victorian butcher. Heâ€™s covered in blood and heâ€™s got a big butcherâ€™s knife, big beard, Scottish guy, and he goes, â€œIâ€™m the butcher!â€ I canâ€™t do the accent very well. Heâ€™s like, â€œWelcome to the Edinburgh dungeons, weâ€™re gonna fucking kill you.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œYes!â€ â€œYes, Iâ€™ve been praying for death!â€ Umâ€¦ Then he goes, â€œBut first, I do have a few safety announcements. Umâ€¦â€ â€œIf you are pregnant or you do have epilepsy, donâ€™t go in the dungeon.â€ Uhâ€¦ Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay.â€ Then he said, â€œAt no point will any of the actors in the dungeon touch you or grab you.â€ So I was like, â€œThatâ€™s good.â€ Right? Nobody wants to be grabbed in the dunge. So I was like, â€œSweet.â€ Umâ€¦ So we start going through and guys, itâ€™s so scary. Like itâ€™s justâ€¦ Iâ€™m quaking with fear. Iâ€™m with these strangers going through. They do this thing where they love to turn off all the lights, pitch-black. And then when they come back on, thereâ€™s a woman standing an inch from your face and being likeâ€¦ [growls] Itâ€™s so scary, but Iâ€™m loving it. Iâ€™m like, â€œAh.â€ Thereâ€™s sort of a narrative arc where, at the very beginning, the butcher was like, â€œYouâ€™re gonna meet the legendary cannibal Sawney Bean.â€ Does anybody know Sawney Bean? Legendary cannibal, apparently, andâ€¦ Weâ€™re like, â€œWe donâ€™t want to meet him. Weâ€™re frightened.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOh no. Heâ€™s going to love you guys.â€ We know itâ€™s building to something. And we get to this part where thereâ€™s a sort of boat underground, weâ€™re in the bowels of Edinburgh, right? And thereâ€™s a boat on a track and we all get in it. And we can hear Sawney Bean in the darkness, toward where weâ€™re headed, going, â€œIâ€™m Sawney Bean.â€ Weâ€™re like, â€œNo!â€ The butcher goes, â€œOkay, guys, youâ€™re on your own now. Iâ€™m leaving you.â€ Weâ€™re like â€œNo, wait. Weâ€™ve learned to love you, we need you.â€ Heâ€™s like â€œFuck you, guysâ€ and he leaves. Now itâ€™s me and my group and weâ€™re in the little boat. The lights go off and itâ€™s pitch-black. You canâ€™t see your hand in front of your face, itâ€™s so dark, and itâ€™s damp and itâ€™s cold. We can hear, â€œIâ€™m Sawney Bean.â€ And Iâ€™m freaking out. Then I feel these hands on my back. Going up my back, and kind of coming around my neck. And Iâ€™m freaking out because Iâ€™m remembering theyâ€™re not allowed to touch you in the dunge. Right? Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatâ€™s happening?â€ The lights come back, I spin round, and thereâ€™s just this middle-aged woman whoâ€™s part of our group. And she just goesâ€¦ [spookily] â€œOoh!â€ It wasâ€¦ insane. â€œOoh-hoo-ooh.â€ And she was with her two teenaged daughters who are sitting on either side of her. Theyâ€™re like, â€œMom, what the fuck are you doing?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œOoh.â€ I think about her all the time. Sheâ€™s like the mailman. Sheâ€™s a hero, you know. A hero to us all. [laughs] But, yeah, I do things like that to, you know, to feel alive and, umâ€¦ Yeah, I try to be very vigilant about my brain because I have a lot of shame about my teens. I behaved very badly. You know? I was very self-destructive and Iâ€¦ The weird thing is I was so angry, I was really angry. And, uhâ€¦ The weird thing is since, like, 2016â€¦ I remember when Trump got elected. I was like, â€œSo we canâ€™t deny anymore that the world is slightly off its axis.â€ Itâ€™s a little fucked, right? We have so much information available to us now, itâ€™s hard to deny the system doesnâ€™t work for everyone. Like, billionaires donâ€™t pay taxes and all the stuff we know. So Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, in a way, my anger was valid.â€ I think a lot of teenagers feel this righteous indignation and stuff. But the method of my rebellion was garbage. Like, it was so self-destructive and self-involved. You know, it was impotent, ultimately. I got this tattoo when I was 16. It says, â€œOatmeal.â€ Umâ€¦ It says, â€œOatmeal,â€ twice. I remember being like, â€œFuck the man, you know.â€ Like, what? [chuckles] So thatâ€™s there for good. Uhâ€¦
[scattered cheers]
Iâ€¦ I remember feeling likeâ€¦ I felt like the world was a house that had been sold to me at a very young age when I was too young to be signing mortgages. A house that was sold to me by a really shady realtor. Like, a kind of greasy, with aâ€¦ A doggy-style baby realtor. [grumbling] â€œSign here, kid.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay.â€ â€œAll your dreams will come true.â€ I sign it, suddenly Iâ€™m in this house. You develop critical thinking. You wake up in the house in your teens. Youâ€™re like, â€œWait.â€ Hang on, the foundations of the house are rotten, the backyardâ€™s on fire â€™cause the previous owners kept heating it with fossil fuels exclusively. So my reaction was, I thought, â€œAll right, Iâ€™ll just bulldoze the house with myself in it.â€ And of course, now I realize what I should have done is put any amount of energy into fixing the house, right? Thatâ€™s what we need to do isâ€¦ Thatâ€™s hopefully what weâ€™re trying to do. We have to, right? Put some energy into making the house a nicer place to live.
â€˜Cause it wonâ€™t do itâ€¦ Yeah.
[crowd cheering]
I do feel we have to consciously do it. Or else it wonâ€™t happen. You know? Umâ€¦ And thatâ€™s why I am reallyâ€¦ I loveâ€¦ I feel like Gen Z is incredible. I donâ€™t believe that theyâ€™re just on TikTok. I think theyâ€™re wicked. Theyâ€™re out there. Theyâ€™re doing stuff. You know, protesting climate change and dismantling rigid gender binaries. What was I doing? I was slithering around being like, â€œDoes anyone have any acid?â€ [laughs awkwardly] Just like useless behavior. And theyâ€™re wicked. I want to talk aboutâ€¦ I want to talk about, like, the gender thing for a sec. Soâ€¦
[crowd cheering]
Just because Iâ€™ve been in the UK, and now Iâ€™m in the States, and in both places thereâ€™s a real hysteria right now around gender and gender identity. And I think part of it comes from this misconception that itâ€™s a recent Gen Z fad. Or a millennial fad, right? To have this fluidity around gender, itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Of courseâ€¦ As long as thereâ€™s been human civilization, we know, right, thereâ€™s been variances in gender. Thereâ€™s been different cultures that recognize third and fourth genders. Not just recognize, revere. Like I could have been revered. I could have been revered. It sucks. And instead Iâ€™m like, â€œWhich bathroom am I allowed to use, please?â€ Umâ€¦ And really it is a recent colonial fad to have this very rigid gender binary. Itâ€™s really like we just went around the world bulldozing over the nuances of all these beautiful things. Umâ€¦ In the UK, where Iâ€™ve been living, I remember in 2018, India decriminalized homosexuality, and it was great. Like, big celebration, really exciting, but it was really frustrating â€™cause the coverage of it on the news in the UK was so smug. It was like, â€œItâ€™s about time, India.â€ And itâ€™s like, England went into India and criminalized homosexuality in 1896. Like, itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s the ultimate gaslighting. Itâ€™s like lighting someoneâ€™s house on fire and being like, â€œItâ€™s really awkward how long itâ€™s taking out to put that out.â€ â€œItâ€™s so embarrassing.â€
[crowd cheering]
Yeah. Thanks. Umâ€¦ Yeah. And the annoying thing is I donâ€™t really want to talk about gender because itâ€™s kind of lose-lose, right? Especially if itâ€™s something that personally affects you and you care about then itâ€™s hard to debate. You get emotional, youâ€™ve already lost. â€˜Cause youâ€™re likeâ€¦ [frustrated whimpering] Like, itâ€™s hard, but I feel like I should talk about it because everyone else is. Like, comedians. Big multimillionaire comedians, in their stand-up specials are, like, taking shots and punching down at a time when trans rights are so tenuous, and slipping backwards, itâ€™s just notâ€¦
Yeah. And, uhâ€¦
[applause]
No, no, no. But I feelâ€¦ Youâ€™re like, â€œYeah, theyâ€™re slipping backwards, yeah.â€ No, just kidding. Iâ€™m suddenly like, â€œOh, fuck.â€ [Mae laughs] The thingâ€¦ And I watch those specials so I can be informed when Iâ€™m asked in every interview to talk about those guysâ€™ specials. But, like, the thing that kept coming up was, â€œGenderâ€™s a fact.â€ That was the refrain of one, â€œGenderâ€™s a fact.â€ Then they cut to the audience. â€œAw, yeah.â€ Theyâ€™re loving it. And itâ€™s like, umâ€¦ I feel like Iâ€™m kind of preaching to the choir a little here, but just to quickly sayâ€¦ Of course, biological sex is real. Itâ€™s a thing. Within that, thereâ€™s tons of variation, itâ€™s very much likeâ€¦ Scientifically, itâ€™s not as binary as we think. Thereâ€™s intersex people, thereâ€™s hormonal variation, all kinds of stuff. But, yeah, for sure, biological sex, no one denies is real, but gender is so much more ephemeral and much more what to do with whatâ€™s in here and in here. Very much like, you know, a social construct. And more fluid. And the way I explain it to people who are trying to understand the difference between biological sex and gender is I picture the gender spectrum. You know the movie Beauty and the Beast? Okay. So imagine if at one end of the gender spectrum, you have Gaston. You remember him? Heâ€™s like, â€œNo one fights likeâ€¦â€ Hot. Heâ€™s hot. Heâ€™s like extreme masculinity. On the other end of the spectrum you have Belle, who has Stockholm Syndrome. So dark, but, umâ€¦ But, guys, sheâ€™s still an excellent role model because she can read. She loves a book. You got to hand it to her. Umâ€¦ And then in the middle of the spectrum, you have the candlestick, right? You have LumiÃ¨re. And I really relate to LumiÃ¨re. I connect with LumiÃ¨re. And obviously the more we empower LumiÃ¨re, the more fun Gaston and Belle are gonna have. LumiÃ¨reâ€™s throwing parties. Theyâ€™re like, â€œBe my guest!â€ Yeah. I have this fantasy. I have this fantasy that likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s a really clear image in my head ofâ€¦ You got Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais, Louis C.K. Throw Joe Rogan in there. And theyâ€™re eating a hog roast. In this fantasy, itâ€™s a huge hog, and theyâ€™re ripping the flesh off it. [chomping sounds] Theyâ€™re drinking goblets of mead. That medieval drink. Theyâ€™re throwing their money. And then they turn the TV on and they see me doing my little Beauty and the Beast genderâ€¦ Just likeâ€¦ â€œAnd the candlestick.â€ And theyâ€™re watching it, and are like, â€œOh my God, weâ€¦ Guys.â€ â€œWe were wrong.â€ â€œOh.â€
And then they justâ€¦
[crowd cheering]
Thatâ€™s my fantasy. Then they just likeâ€¦ You know what I want? I want them toâ€¦ I want them to cradle each other. I want them to hold each other gently, and just gently rock. I want them to re-parent themselves, basically. Just give a littleâ€¦ That. â€˜Cause I do understand too. I get it. Itâ€™s hard to learn new language. You know? Although, is it? Likeâ€¦ Omicron, you know? We picked that up pretty fast. Umâ€¦ But theâ€¦ The joke I always hear, and this has been a jokeâ€¦ This was hack in the â€™90s, this joke. Itâ€™s come back with a vengeance on the stand-up circuit. Itâ€™s like, â€œWell, like, I identify as a cactus.â€ Or, â€œI identify as a lamp post,â€ or this inanimate object. And itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Um, yeah, Iâ€™m non-binary, which is under the banner of trans identity. In that like the sex I was assigned at birth doesnâ€™t feel like it fit. [giggles awkwardly] Umâ€¦ And, uhâ€¦ But itâ€™s like, I donâ€™t want to necessarily identify as non-binary or trans, I just am that, I just am. And to say otherwise would be bizarre. It would be like doing a violence to myself. Thatâ€™s what it would feel like. It would be like the hot tomato soup thing, times a hundred, just full of tomato soup. Itâ€™s tricky because itâ€™s likeâ€¦ You just have to take my word for it that I know who I am. Itâ€™s so hard saying that to people. Itâ€™s like, I justâ€¦ You just have to take my word for it. I am certain of it. And itâ€™s likeâ€¦ I may not be certain if a Toyota Tercel can fit under a moose. Very unsure. But I do know this. Also, you donâ€™t have to understand it even. You know what I mean? Like, I do not understand Wi-Fi. How does it work? What is it? But I know that itâ€™s real. I know it exists among us.
I just accept that itâ€™s there, whatever.
[crowd cheering]
I donâ€™t let it keep me up at night. Iâ€™m not likeâ€¦ Yeah. Umâ€¦ Yeah, so I had top surgery last December and Iâ€™m on a low dose of testosterone for this past year. And itâ€™s been the best year of my life. Genuinely. And Iâ€™m 35 years old. This has been the best year of my life.
Yeah.
[crowd cheering]
Thanks. Umâ€¦ And itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Whatâ€™s weird is, like, Iâ€™m not that happy. Iâ€™m not skipping around. Itâ€™s truly just the absence of agony. Thatâ€™s all it is. And thatâ€™s a low bar, and who are we to deny anybody that? The absence of agony, yeah. Thatâ€™s going to be myâ€¦ [laughs] Thatâ€™s going to be my album title. Umâ€¦ Yeah, okay. And also, Iâ€™m really just so grateful to have the language now. Right? Growing up I didnâ€™t have that language. But I always felt this way and I remember beingâ€¦ You know when youâ€™re four or five and your parents tell the story of your birth? You know? Andâ€¦ I feel like my parentsâ€¦ It sounds like they were always talking about my conception and my birth. I swear we had normal conversations as well. But I remember my dad telling me, â€œYour mother went into labor, we went to the hospital.â€ He was saying, â€œMaybe youâ€™ll have your own kids one day.â€ And Iâ€™m imagining having my own kids. In my fantasy of having children, I was never the one having the kids. It was a really specific fantasy where I was this 1950s businessman father, just like pacing the halls of the hospital. Smoking. Justâ€¦ Really like a very 101 Dalmatians vibe. Then some nurse would be like, â€œItâ€™s a boy.â€ And Iâ€™d be like, â€œCheers, gentlemen.â€ â€œIâ€™ll name it Buster.â€ â€œSend it down the mines.â€ Um, yeah. Okay, weâ€™re almost at the end. I have one more thing to tell you. Iâ€™m gonna get my mic stand. If Iâ€¦ Yeah, imagine if I lost it? So, I feel likeâ€¦ And by the way, thank you so much. This has been reallyâ€¦ Youâ€™ve been amazing.
[crowd cheering]
I feel like weâ€™ve been through, likeâ€¦ In terms of our worldview, weâ€™ve been through pessimism and optimism. And I really want to end on a positive note. So I want to tell you this Buddhist parable that I love. Um, this isâ€¦ Stay with me. Soâ€¦ I love this story. Umâ€¦ And then Iâ€™m gonna go. It takes place in the forest, actually. Weâ€™re back in the forest. And, basically, in this parable, this man is being chased, pursued through the forest by what I can only describe as a beast from hell. Like, a really terrifying creature with a lionâ€™s jaws and this monstrous body. Its nature is pure hunger. It wants to devour this man, and itâ€™s been chasing him for days, and heâ€™s been running. And heâ€™s starting to get exhausted. At some point, heâ€™s going to succumb to the beast. Just when he thinks heâ€™s gonna pass out and the beast is gonna get him, he sees this little stone well in the middle of the forest, little circular well. Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ll hide in the well from the beast.â€ He jumps in. Sure enough, the beast doesnâ€™t follow him It stops at the top and is likeâ€¦ [growls] Heâ€™s like, â€œGreat.â€ Heâ€™s falling down the well, and as heâ€™s falling, he feels water splashing up onto his feet. Heâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s weird.â€ And he looks down. And below him, where heâ€™s headed, the water is churning wildly, and he realizesâ€¦ Whatâ€™s at the bottom of the well? Another beast. Yeah. Itâ€™s a double beast situash. Bad. Bad news. Beast at the top, beast below. [growls] Like that. And, at the last second, he sees this branch growing out of the side of the well, like a gnarly branch. So he grabs onto it and he uses his last remaining strength to maneuver himself up onto this branch. And his muscles are quivering. But heâ€™s like, â€œI made it.â€ The beast is there, the beast below. And the branch is creaking under his weight, like, this is not a permanent solution. Right? At some point, the branch is going to give out. And heâ€™s sweatingâ€¦ heâ€™s sweating in that crease here. You know? If youâ€™re sweating in that crease, you are in trouble. And suddenly he looks to the end of the branch and he sees something glistening on the end. Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat is that?â€ And so he balances and he reaches out with one finger to the end of the branch, and he gets it on his finger. Itâ€™s golden, glistening tree sap. Itâ€™s tree sap. And he puts it in his mouth and heâ€™s like, â€œIs that? Thatâ€™s delicious.â€ Guys, itâ€™s positive. Wait. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s it. No. Hello? [laughs] Okay. Okay. Uhâ€¦ Trust me, I find it very positive. You got to get on board. Please. Iâ€™ve called the show SAP. You truly must get on board. Like, this was not cheap.
[crowd cheering]
No, but I really do find it positive because itâ€™s, like, look. Life might be a double beast situash. That might be just what lifeâ€¦ In a way, is it not? Know what I mean? But luckily thereâ€™s so much sap, and we have to just to take the time, itâ€™s worth it to enjoy the sap, and cultivate it where we can. And luckily thereâ€™s an abundance of sap, I think. Like everywhere you look, if you look hard. You got dogs. Every dog on this Earth. Like a good pair of jeans. Thatâ€™s sap. That can be sap. The Beatles, for me, are sap. Umâ€¦ Your friends. The TV show Friends. No, like having friends. Um, sex is good. Sex with your friends is pretty good. Umâ€¦ Scaring people, â€œOoh.â€ Yeah, if thatâ€™sâ€¦ I like campfires, roasting marshmallows, the song â€œBennie and the Jetsâ€ by Elton John. Umâ€¦ Yeah, hugs and sparklers, Christmas lights, all those things are fully sap. All those things can be sap. And genuinely, this may be corny, but truly, this is sap for me. Doing this makes me so happy and itâ€™s sap for me. And Iâ€™m so grateful to you all for coming.
[crowd cheering]
Thank you so much.
[continue cheering]
[continue cheering]
[man clapping]
Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Oh, fuck. [sniffles] [sobbing] Oh my God. Oh my God. Areâ€¦ Wait. Are you crying? Yeah, I mean, it was all just so sad. [sobbing] It was supposed to be funny.
No, it wasnâ€™t.
Yeah, it was. The whole thing. Really? [sighs] Guess you and I just have different senses of humor. Well, thank you for listening anyway. [sniffs] Itâ€™s good to get that stuff off my chest. No, itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m me. You are you. Itâ€™s wonderful.
Well, should we get started?
Yeah.
[grunts]
[Mae sighs]
Are you excited?
Yeah, Iâ€™m a little nervous. Iâ€™m excited. Nervous is normal. This is a bit heavy. The Buchananâ€™s got a lot of mail this season.
Oh, really? Popular?
Youâ€™re gonna love this.
Okay.
All right. Shovels.
Yeah.
Yeah? Ooh.
[both laugh]
[pensive music playing]
Iâ€™m so happy you came.
[Mae] Yeah, thanks for having me. I canâ€™t believe it was supposed to be funny.
Yeah, wellâ€¦
Thatâ€™s crazy. Parts were poignant, I guess. Butâ€¦
Yeah. All right, so here we go.
Okay. Letâ€™s get a little hole going here. There you go. Get in there. Youâ€™re gonna love this, Mae.
Over-the-shoulder?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, ready.
One, two, three. Yeah!
Feels good, huh?
[Mae laughs] Sick. Should weâ€¦?
[man] Yeah, grab some mail.
What do youâ€¦ What do you usually? Is this one fine?
[both continue indistinctly]
<END>

<START>
[audience cheering]
[upbeat music playing]
[Amy] Thank you so much, LA. Please, thank you. LA!
[audience cheering]
Donâ€™t make me like you. Oh, my God, thereâ€™s, like, some young people up front. Like howâ€¦ how old are you?
[woman] Twenty-seven.
[Amy] Twenty-seven. Ohâ€¦ remember?
[audience laughing]
Remember 27? [sighs] God, youâ€™re so cute and everythingâ€™s still up high andâ€¦ Youâ€™re wearing heels. Youâ€™re gonnaâ€¦ Someday, youâ€™re gonnaâ€¦ These are gonna be your heels. Okay?
[audience laughing]
Right here. To me, these are heels now. Okay? Thereâ€™s an orthopedic insert in here.
Whatâ€™s your name?
[woman] Libby.
â€œLibby.â€ Thatâ€™s so cute. Twenty-seven. Libby. Oh, my God. Do you drink? Are you a drinker? Little bit? Okay. Hereâ€™s the kind of drinking Iâ€™ve been doing lately, okay, on this tour. Like, yesterday is the only day I didnâ€™t drink, and I drank. Do you know what I mean?
[audience laughing]
[Amy] You know? You donâ€™t count it â€™cause it was less than five. Started early, yeah. So I donâ€™t count that, yeah. â€˜Cause I, uhâ€¦ I used to black out, Libby. Last week. And, uhâ€¦ Nothing good ever happens in a black-out, right? Iâ€™ve never woken up, like, â€œWhat is this Pilates mat doing out? Wow.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWho cleaned?â€ No. No. Wake up with a potato skin like an eye patch. Dried ice cream on my neck. I hope!
[audience laughing]
[audience whistling]
[Amy] Canâ€™t drink like we used to, huh? I just turned 40. Again.
[audience cheering]
Thank you. Thank you. Keep doing it. Keep doing it. And, uh, you know, Iâ€™ve always preached confidence for women. You know, to feel great in your own skin. Right? And then the day I turned 40, I took my skin and I got it lasered. Hmâ€¦
[audience laughing]
[Amy] So, Libby, what laser isâ€¦ is they shoot a laser at your face. Okay, you pay them money, a lot of money, and in return they shoot you in the face with a laser beam. The thing that in the Oceanâ€™s Eleven bank heist movies, theyâ€™re trying to avoid to get the money. You, instead, put your face in front of them. Itâ€™s incredible what laser does. What happens isâ€¦ you turn blood-red, but then the skin falls off your face. But then, six-to-eight weeks laterâ€¦ you look exactly the same.
[audience laughing and applauding]
[Amy] Amazing, right? Itâ€™s just incredible what they can do now. Justâ€¦ I got filler in my face. Uh, then they dissolved it, â€™cause, as it turns out, I was already full. Iâ€¦ [chuckles] Tomâ€¦ Tom, youâ€™re doing â€œAâ€ cam, right? Can you get in close on this in case people donâ€™t know? So, my faceâ€¦ Someone, just because they were wearing a white lab coat, talked me into needing more volume up here. Okay? It already looks like Iâ€™m storing nuts for the winter. [makes munching sound] I came home, scared the shit out of my husband. Just bleeding. Just needle marks. Heâ€™s like, â€œHoly fuck, were you in a fire?â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m like, â€œI wasnâ€™t not in a fire.â€ â€œWait until my laser kicks in, babe. Youâ€™re gonna be hard as a rock.â€ I got lipo, and then I, in record time, gained the weight back. Lipo is the laziest thing Iâ€™ve personally ever done. That was my way of saying, â€œI would rather have major surgeryâ€¦ than be a little hungry once.â€
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s the truth. Iâ€™m never hungry. I never let it get to that, you know? I feel it coming about an hour away and thatâ€™s when I combat it. You know? You know, Iâ€™m doing my best. I had a baby. Not bad for a year. Right?
[audience cheering]
Itâ€™s been three.
[audience laughing]
And a half. But, uhâ€¦ You ever get handed a new insecurity when you werenâ€™t really expecting it? Someone will just kinda mosey up and hit you with it. Theyâ€™ll justâ€¦ â€œHey, you know who you look like?â€ I go, â€œNo, thanks.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œIâ€™m not open to that feedback right now. Thank you.â€ Itâ€™s never somebody good, right? Itâ€™s never a model. Itâ€™s always, like, their fucked-up cousin. â€œLook!â€ [sighs] I just got handed a new insecurity by a trusted friend. Itâ€™s when youâ€™re feeling safe that someone will hit you with something they thought youâ€™d already accepted about yourself. You know, she goes, â€œYou know how youâ€™re short-waisted?â€ I was like, â€œYes! What?â€
[audience laughing]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou know the way your ass goes all the way to your armpit, and you donâ€™t reallyâ€¦â€ â€œLike an ostrich! Cool! Okay, good! Good!â€ â€œI love that!â€ But I just got hit with a new insecurity that rocked me. I was getting acupuncture to see if I could still feel, and, uhâ€¦ Heâ€™s working on me, and with so much enthusiasm, like it wasnâ€™t a big deal, he says to me, â€œDid you know that you have a hump?â€
[audience laughing]
I said, â€œMy lovely lady lumps?â€
[audience cheering]
â€œCheck it out!â€ Right? Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, you have a hump.â€ And I do. Iâ€™ll show you. On the back of my neck, okay, donâ€™t miss out on this shot, Tom. Get in here. Okay? Check that out. Iâ€¦ Someone goes, â€œOh, yeah!â€ Yes, I do. Iâ€™m humped, okay. Like a whale, or a camel. Or that guy who loves Notre-Dame. Iâ€¦ found out in my 40s that all this time Iâ€™ve been rocking a hump. I said, â€œWhat do we do?â€ He goes, â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything we can do.â€ â€œSo you just needed me to know?â€ He goes, â€œItâ€™s called a â€˜widowâ€™s hump.'â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m all set with info about that. Thank you.â€ He said, â€œWell, just try holding your neck back further.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œLike this?â€ He said, â€œYeah, thatâ€™s good.â€ â€œOkay, yeah. Less hump. Is thisâ€¦?â€ So, I know a lot of you are sitting there thinking, â€œDo I have a hump?â€ Andâ€¦ I donâ€™t want you to be shy. Youâ€™re a little emâ€¦ Just feel free. Just go in there and feel. The way youâ€™ll know, is when you run your finger down your neck, youâ€™ll run into a hump.
[audience laughing]
So thatâ€™s my little secret insecurity. Okay? Iâ€™m humped. We all have some little secret insecurity, right? Likeâ€¦ I just met someone, and I donâ€™t think their insecurity can be a secret. Okay, now, this story really happened. Okay? My husband and I were invited to a dinner party. Very last minute. We think we were a last-minute fill-in. Not a big deal. We go to the party, and it was at this really rich guyâ€™s house. We never met him before. Right before we go in, our friend who invited us says, â€œOh, just so you know, heâ€™s blind, but itâ€™s a secret.â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuck are you talking about?â€ â€œFrom who?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWell, um, he doesnâ€™t acknowledge it, and everyone around him acts like itâ€™s not happening.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYou can be that rich that youâ€™re just not blind?â€ Turns out, yeah. Soâ€¦ I was glad she gave me a heads-up, you know, â€™cause, like, I have no impulse control. In ten seconds in his house, I would have been like, â€œAre you fucking blind?â€ I was glad she gave me a heads-up, â€™causeâ€¦ Sometimes people give you a heads-up for things that arenâ€™t necessary, and it makes everything awkward. You know? Someone will be, like, â€œOkay, and heâ€™s Black.â€ â€œShould I change the music?â€ What are you talking about? You donâ€™t have to warn me about, you knowâ€¦ Or, â€œAnd sheâ€™s gay.â€ â€œOh, should I eat her out?â€
â€œIs thatâ€¦?â€
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s a weird warning, but, uhâ€¦ But, â€œHeâ€™s blind and itâ€™s a secretâ€? Thank you. A â€œsecret blindâ€ is a heads-up I want. Soâ€¦ So we go in andâ€¦ heâ€™s blind. Okay? Heâ€™s in the kitchen, because heâ€™s cooking. And you could tellâ€¦ Heâ€™s looking up. He says, â€œHey, great to meet you. No shaking hands. Covid.â€ And weâ€™re like, â€œThatâ€™s why.â€
Uhâ€¦
[audience laughing]
And he offers us a drink. I said, â€œSure, yeah. Great.â€ So I went over to grab a glass, and I am not kidding you, I turn around, and heâ€™s like this.
[audience laughing]
[audience clapping]
All night, shit like this is happening. People just clean it up and act like it didnâ€™t happen. Keep it moving. Dinner took nine years to cook. Weâ€™re all sitting around pretending to eat and, uhâ€¦ Iâ€™m keeping the conversation going. Iâ€™m trying to fill the air, but I kept on talking about vision by accident. You donâ€™t realize how much you talk about it, you know. Iâ€¦ I actually said this sentence, okay, to a blind person. I said, â€œIs anyone watching The Watcher?â€
[audience laughing]
What? Thatâ€™s a double-blind. I fucked up. His girlfriend was there. I said, â€œHow long have you guys been seeing each other?â€ Fucking fuck. â€œSmelling her?â€ Umâ€¦ This rich guy. In his late 50s. Had a very young girlfriend. Very young. Iâ€™m like, â€œLet me guess, sheâ€™s an old soul.â€ Right? Isnâ€™t that the story, LA? Twenty-three-year-old pussy, but what an old soul on the gal. Wait until you get a load of her soul! Yeah. And I donâ€™t think itâ€™s cool to make fun of blind people. I just donâ€™t think you can be a secret blind. Okay? And if thereâ€™s gonna be one group of people thatâ€™s really mad at me, that feels like a safe one.
[audience laughing]
â€œWeâ€™re gonna get you!â€ Are you?
[audience laughing]
I shouldnâ€™t be baiting the crowd like this. I really shouldnâ€™t. People ask, â€œIs this a dangerous time for comedians?â€ You know, I donâ€™t know if you saw, Chappelle got tackled on-stage. And just all this crazy shitâ€™s been happening. When they ask, Iâ€™m like, â€œYes.â€ â€œIâ€™m on the front lines every night.â€ Like, no. Not if youâ€™re me, you know. Maybe if youâ€™re them, you have these spryâ€¦ Iâ€™m like, â€œMy people are like me. Okay?â€ Weâ€™re tired.
[audience laughing]
[chuckles] Nobodyâ€™s tackling anybody. Weâ€™re all too tired. I donâ€™t know about you, hereâ€™s where I am with my energy level lately. If I sit down and realize I didnâ€™t grab the remoteâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™ll just sit thereâ€¦ for as long as it takes. Right? Thereâ€™s one of us in every relationship. The piece of shit. Right? You just sit there. You wait for your partner to come in. â€œHey, can you grab the remote?â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œHave you been sitting here for two hours?â€ Goes to sit down. â€œAnd also can you get me another drink? Oh.â€ What else is going on in my life? Oh, I have a little boy.
[audience cheering]
A little boy. Yeah. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m a good parent. I think Iâ€™m just getting used to failing. Is that what being a parent is? Justâ€¦ Just bombing. Itâ€™s like stand-up. You know, you just get used to it. I justâ€¦ I donâ€™t think anybodyâ€™s failed as hard as I did, as quickly, though. Do you know what I named my son? Let me walk you through it, okay? Listen up, Libby. Soâ€¦ Our sonâ€™s first name is Gene. Okay? Gene. Basic. We named him after my husbandâ€™s mom, who passed away, which is very sad, of course.
[audience laughing]
But also, to notâ€¦ have a mother-in-lawâ€¦
[audience laughing]
It sounds like somebody has a lucky hump. Soâ€¦ Very sad, of course. My husbandâ€™s last name is Fischer. Thatâ€™s why I, Amy, didnâ€™t take it.
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™sâ€¦ You might be a little young for this reference, Libby, butâ€¦ Google â€œAmy Fisherâ€ when you get home. And, uh, itâ€™s not good. Soâ€¦ Then came his middle name, and thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s where I fucked up. Okay? I, uh, I wanted to pay tribute to my favorite comedian, my good friend, Mr. Dave Attell. â€“ All right. So Iâ€¦
[small cheer]
Thatâ€™s about right. So Iâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Truly my favorite comedian of all time. So we gave him the middle name â€œAttell.â€ So I was about a month into being a new mom, sitting on the couch when I realized that Iâ€™ve named my sonâ€¦ â€œGenital Fissure.â€
[audience laughing]
Anybody ever fuck up like that? I donâ€™t think so. We changed his middle name as soon as we realized. I think itâ€™s better. We changed it to â€œFingerbang Shit-Snatch.â€ Is that better? Orâ€¦ Is anybody here pregnant? Any pregnant people here? Oh, congratulations. Are you keeping it?
[audience laughing]
Hey, weâ€™re in one of the states where we still have a choice. Right?
[audience cheering]
Can you believe it? In Wisconsin, I didnâ€™t want to ask the crowd. You know? Itâ€™s, like, yeah. They could always drive to Illinois. Just recommending. But, uhâ€¦ Yeah. People love giving pregnant women advice, donâ€™t they? They love it. They just love it. The whole time I was pregnant, I have this one friend, sheâ€™d always tell me, Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou have to do prenatal yoga.â€ â€œIt really helps with the birth. Prenatal yoga.â€ So I immediately signed up for a C-section.
[audience laughing]
Because, fuck that, okay? If Iâ€™m ever in downward dog, I fell. Upward humpback Jew. Thatâ€™s my resting pose, right here. I did. I had aâ€¦ I had a C. Came out the sunroof. And, uhâ€¦ You know, some women feel like they failed if they donâ€™t give birth vaginally. And the only thing that really comforts me is my still-perfect pussy. Itâ€™s reallyâ€¦
[audience cheering]
No, itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s not good. Trust me. Things still shift, you know what I mean? I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what it is. When I take a bath, I feel like I fill up. You know? I just kindaâ€¦ floating in there. Justâ€¦ Just kind of squishing around after for hours. But they tell you, no matter how you give birth, C-section, vaginalâ€¦ They almost never come out of your asshole.
They tell youâ€¦
[audience laughing]
The doctor is very serious right after you give birth. They say, â€œNow, listen, you cannot have sex for six weeks.â€ â€œOkay? No sex. Six weeks.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, let me write that down. Sixâ€¦â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, wait, remember when you just, uh, Wolverineâ€™d my FUPA open?â€
[audience laughing]
How about six years? Thatâ€™s when I think Iâ€™ll want to do that again. â€œHis foot got caught on my intestines on the way out.â€ â€œWhen can I get raw-dogged from behind?â€ [chuckles] Theseâ€¦ â€œI need dick!â€ Like, whoâ€™sâ€¦? â€œFive weeks?â€ Yeah, okay. I had this awful condition while I was pregnant called hyperemesis gravidarum. Severe nausea and vomiting, the whole pregnancy. I was so relieved when I was diagnosed, it was like six months in. I was like, â€œOkay, we know what it is. What do we do?â€ And they explained to me, â€œWe havenâ€™t been able to study it because it only happens to women.â€
[audience laughing]
[audience cheering]
â€œBut if your husband wants, we have chewable Viagra.â€ Which is a real product. Because, sometimes, itâ€™s scary to take a pill.
[audience laughing]
â€œI wanna get hard, but I donâ€™t want to take a pill.â€
[audience cheering]
â€œOkay, you can chew it. Okay.â€ I have severe endometriosis. Very painful. A debilitating disease. About 10% of women have that. There are no studies. But if your dick curves slightly one way, they got you, bro! Any dick-mergency, the Paw Patrol is on the way! Got a hysterectomy this year. Wanted to lose those last three pounds, am I right, ladies? [chuckles] No. I had to get it removed because of my endometriosis. And, uhâ€¦ It was a big surgery. They took out my uterus, they found cysts in my ovaries. They found a tumor in my appendix. But the craziest thing they found was that my liver was fine.
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s such a fun New York moment right after that surgery. I was walking around feeling sorry for myself, and there was this group of big meathead dudes. One of them recognized me and goes, â€œHey! Amy Schumer!â€ â€œHow you doing?â€ I was feeling kind of honest. You know, I was like, â€œNot great. I just had my uterus removed.â€
[audience laughing]
And his response made me feel so much better. He goes, â€œOh, no!â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYou should get it back!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s notâ€¦â€ â€œThatâ€™s not really how that works, but thank you, sir.â€ I feel so much better after getting that surgery, the laparoscopy and all that. I, uhâ€¦ If you have endometriosisâ€¦ The only way I can describe how much better I feel, is like if you ever saw Willy Wonka, you know those old people that are all in that bed, 69-ing all day, likeâ€¦
[audience laughing]
[moans] And the one grandpa gets the golden ticket and he gets out and clicks his heels. Like, thatâ€™s me. You knowâ€¦ Thatâ€™s how much better I feel. Iâ€™m like a new personâ€¦ Iâ€™m a new mom. You know, I can run with my son now. I donâ€™t, but, uhâ€¦ You know. I, uhâ€¦ We had a medical emergency in the audience last weekend on the road. It was very strange. I learned a lot about my crowd. It was in the balcony. This guy was having a seizure. Heâ€™s fine. You know, Iâ€¦ I didnâ€™t follow up. But Iâ€™m assuming, you know, I would have heard. No, heâ€™s fine. But, uhâ€¦ But in the moment it was scary. We had to turn the house lights on. This is when I learned about my crowd, because I was like, â€œWe need a doctor! Go!â€ Not one.
[audience laughing]
The entire audience, not one doctor. So Iâ€™m like, okay, â€œNurses!â€ And there were like 40 nurses but they were all hammered.
[audience laughing]
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™re not on-call. Fuck you!â€ I was like, â€œFair.â€ Thank God for our nurses. You know?
[audience cheering]
Yeah. Fuck yeah. I really couldnâ€™tâ€¦ couldnâ€™t sleep after that. It was justâ€¦ It was alarming, you know? It was likeâ€¦ I mean, I can never sleep anyway. Iâ€™m such a bad sleeper. Whenever I say that, somebody is like, â€œHave you tried melatonin?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œCBD?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI need heroin, okay?â€ Fucking melatonin. Get outta here. I mean, they told us how we can get better sleep. We all know the advice, right? They said, â€œIf you want the best night of sleep of your life, an hour before you go to bed, turn your phone off.â€ What do we all say? â€œNo.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œThatâ€™s crazy.â€ â€œOh, you donâ€™t care about sleep?â€ I care about sleep more than anything in the world. Iâ€™ll take any pill, Iâ€™ll have any surgery. â€œWhy not just 15 minutes before you go to bed, power down?â€ â€œFuck you!â€
[audience laughing]
I need to be staring into the abyss of my phone as Iâ€™m falling asleep, okay? Plus, I need to be reading something. Iâ€™m eating. [scoffs]
[audience laughing]
They did do one study on women. You may have read about this. They found that social media is harmful to young girls. Thank you, NASA. We know. Right? Since weâ€™ve been in town, I saw this group of girls, maybe 12 years old. These little girls were taking selfies. You know, and they knew their angles. Know what Iâ€™m saying? Maybe some people donâ€™t know. Likeâ€¦ Like, your anglesâ€¦ Okay. Like, see how my leg looks if you look straight on? Get a shot of this, Tom. Look at that. Disgusting.
[audience laughing]
What is that, Gollum? Thatâ€™s heinous. Now watch this. Bam! Whoa! Everyoneâ€™s hard.
[audience laughing]
And they knew their good side, these 12-year-old girls. They see so many pictures of themselves. Like, Iâ€™m 41. I know my angles. Okay? At this point, the photographer gets in a tree, and I dig a deep trench. I kinda get down thereâ€¦ Thatâ€™s me. Thatâ€™s where I shine, you know? Twelve years old. Remember when we were 12? Somebody took a picture of us once a year.
[audience laughing]
Right? Maybe twice if we had a school dance. Right? Somebodyâ€™s dad had a camera. It was like, â€œWhoa! I didnâ€™t know Lindsay was rich! Her dad has a whole camera!â€ We didnâ€™t know our angles. Theyâ€™d say, â€œCheese!â€ And weâ€™d all just kindaâ€¦ [grunts] Looked like we were shitting ourselves. Because we were. Because all we ate was dairy. Right? We didnâ€™t have oat milk, or almond milk, or Erewhon.
[audience laughing]
We had whole milk. And we drank it with every meal. Youâ€™d have a grilled-cheese sandwich with a cup of milk. Our skin was bad, we were farting all over the place. It was disgusting. But we were happy, goddamn it.
[audience cheering]
Right? I donâ€™t know, Libby. Twenty-seven. What would it be like to be 27 now? You grew up seeing so many more pictures of yourself. Hereâ€™s a good thing. You are definitely vaccinated for chicken pox. Probably donâ€™t even know it. Remember our vaccine for chicken pox? Is that your mom would push you in a roomâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€¦with neighbors who had them, justâ€¦ [groans] Sheâ€™d go, â€œGet it!â€ That was our vaccine. â€œGo get it!â€ Horrifying. Youâ€™re definitely vaccinated for HPV. And I feel bad for you. Youâ€™re missing out on an important character-building experience.
[audience laughing]
We all had it. All my friends, we all got it. Admitted it to each other after college. Weâ€™re all crying. â€œIâ€™m a whore!â€ [mock crying] â€œIâ€™m gonna have to tell all my future partners!â€ Never told one person. [mock crying] We all got it. Iâ€™m still really close with my girls from high school. I feel so lucky about that friendship. Yeah. Itâ€™s the best. I realized thoughâ€¦ that we text each other like weâ€™re fucking. Like, I text them in this intimate way I would never text my husband. You know? Iâ€™ll be likeâ€¦ â€œText me the second youâ€™re home safe.â€ â€œHome.â€ â€œThank God.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYour ass in those jeans tonight, what?â€ â€œWhen can we be together again?â€ If Chris ever got a text like that from me, heâ€™d think I was fucking kidnapped. Heâ€™d call the police. I was out drinking with my girlfriends one night. And, uhâ€¦ We were talking about how lazy weâ€™ve gotten, sexually. And, uh, I was like, â€œWhat if we text all of our husbands â€˜Do you want to have phone sex right now?'â€ We were crying we were laughing so hard. We thoughtâ€¦ We thought it was so funny. And we did it, and we got such different responses from these dudes. My husband wrote back the fastest, okay, and he just wrote, â€œFuck you.â€
[audience laughing]
Okay. Thatâ€™s fair. Itâ€™s what I deserve. You know? And my friend Jessâ€™ husband, we declared the loser because he just wrote, â€œToo tired.â€
[audience laughing]
Weâ€™re such hypocrites. We were pissed. And then, uhâ€¦ My friend Carolineâ€™s husband said, uh, â€œWhen the kids go to bed.â€ Not bad. But the winner, we declared, was my friend Andreaâ€™s husband, who just immediately called. Hello?
[audience laughing]
Joke was on her. She had to have phone sex with her husband that night. She answered like she was in a horror film. â€œHello?â€ I love my girls. Theyâ€™re all teachers and nurses from Long Island. and they, uhâ€¦ Yeah. Teachers.
[audience cheering]
Holy shit. Thank you, teachers. They came with me when I hosted the Oscars. They were on the red carpet with me, and it wasâ€¦ It was so fun having them there. And they were so excited. At first.
[audience laughing]
Justâ€¦ We just get used to shit so quick, donâ€™t we? These girls, at first theyâ€™re so starstruck. Theyâ€™re like, [gasps] â€œThereâ€™s Ryan Reynolds!â€ And, â€œIs that Taylor Swift?â€ And then 20 minutes later, my friend Jess walks over smoking a cigarette. Sheâ€™s like, â€œMeryl Streepâ€™s chatty.â€
[audience laughing]
[exhales] This bitch. You know? I love my girls. We all got married. I canâ€™t believe we got married. We, uhâ€¦ All of us. Iâ€™ve only been married for five years, but this is what I think marriage is so far. I think marriage is finding someone who can stand you.
[audience laughing]
Is that too romantic? Find someone who can fucking stand you. Especially during the pandemic when we were all just home, justâ€¦ Staring at each other. Judging. Waiting to criticize each other. â€œYou gonna chew like that?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œNo. No.â€ â€œDidnâ€™t know if youâ€™re trying to wake the neighbors â€™cause itâ€™s so loud. But no.â€ My husbandâ€¦ We were fightingâ€¦ What was our last fight? Oh, we went to see Top Gun. Anybody see Top Gun?
[audience cheering]
It was cute, right? I was impressed. Do you know that Tom Cruise does all his own Scientology?
[audience laughing]
I dragged him there. I wanted to see it in the theater. You know, we were fighting. I donâ€™t remember what about. I remember I was right. But, uhâ€¦ Butâ€¦ This is why I like being married because itâ€™s, you know, he said, â€œI donâ€™t even want to be near you right now.â€ Before we were married, I would have been likeâ€¦ But Iâ€™m like, â€œCan I have your wallet? I still want to see Top Gun.â€
[audience laughing]
Kinda throws it to me. He leaves. I just walked to the movie. Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck this guy. Iâ€™ll see him at home. [mutters] Half a block later, heâ€™s back walking next to me. Gave him his wallet. We didnâ€™t talk about it. Just moved on. Gotta keep it moving. Right? Keep it moving. But he can stand me. Do you guys know who Hilaria Baldwin is?
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m saying it wrong. Iâ€™m sorry. [Spanish accent] Hilariaâ€¦ Baldwin. [normal accent] Okay. So, I just canâ€™t wrap my head around this story. If you donâ€™t know who I mean, this is Alec Baldwinâ€™s wife. Okay? And I met her years ago, backstage at SNL. Alec was like, â€œI want you to meet my wife.â€ And I saw her, and I said, â€œNo, thank you.â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m trying to hang on to my self-esteem. Okay? She is a tiny Disney princess, and Iâ€¦ look like Ben Roethlisberger from most angles. She came over. [Spanish accent] â€œIâ€™m Hilaria from Espania.â€ [normal accent] Very thick Spanish accent. Okay? From Spain. You might have seen her on a morning show doing a cooking demonstration where she had trouble remembering how to pronounce the word [Spanish accent] â€œHow you say, â€˜cucumberâ€™?â€ [normal accent] She was wearing a dress. They said, â€œWhereâ€™s your dressâ€¦?â€ [Spanish accent] â€œI donâ€™t know if you have it, Itâ€™s from Zara.â€ [normal accent] They have a von Traap-amount of children, and, uhâ€¦
[audience laughing]
And they named them all, Iâ€™m not sure, but, very Spanish names like JamÃ³n, and Croqueta, and Flamenco. You know? And all of this would be fine and beautiful, exceptâ€¦ [Spanish accent] â€¦that Hilaria from Espaniaâ€¦ [normal accent] â€¦is actually Hillary from Boston.
[audience laughing]
This woman is in no way Spanish. Her parents are not from Spain. No one in her life is from Spain. You went, â€œWhat?â€ Did you think I was just doing a really racist Spanish impressionâ€¦? Youâ€™re like, â€œWow. Wow.â€ So, Iâ€™m not trying to bully a sociopath. I have a point. Okay?
[audience laughing]
So I think what had happened wasâ€¦ I think she went to Spain. Because, again, I cannot tell you how much her family is not from Spain. They were early settlers in the U.S. Iâ€™m not fucking with you, they were on the Mayflower. Thatâ€™s how much this chick is from Boston. Butâ€¦ I think what had happened was, she went to Spain. And Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to go to Spain. Some of you have. Itâ€™s great, right? Donâ€™t you love it? I loved it, too. But Hillary from Boston fucking loved it. [Spanish accent] â€œI am going to be from it!â€ [normal accent] Did you know you can just decide where youâ€™re from? Like, on my driverâ€™s license, it says that I am from Splash Mountain.
[audience laughing]
Isnâ€™t that great? Libby, do you ever go on vacation and have a good time?
Where? Whereâ€™d you go?
[Libby] Mexico.
Mexico? Youâ€™re from there. Enjoy. Enjoy. So hereâ€™s my point, okay. I actually have a point. Okay. My point isâ€¦ that all evidence points to this woman, since she met her husband, has straight-up pretended to be from Spain. And her husband shot someone. Now, stay with me!
[audience laughing]
Stay with me. My point isâ€¦ neither of them give a fuck. Find someone who can stand you.
[audience cheering]
My husband. The love of my life. We have sex sometimes. And, uh, married people, have you found this? Weâ€™ve found the best weekday to have sex is always tomorrow.
[audience laughing]
Is that when you guys have sex? â€œWe ate today. Maybe we wonâ€™tâ€¦ eat tomorrow. Thatâ€™ll be a big day for us. You know?â€ â€œYeah, weâ€™ll definitely fuck each other tomorrow.â€ And then you do it. And you act like you went on some excursion. Like you were bowling. â€œThat was fun. We have to remember we like doing that.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWe should bowl more. Why donâ€™t we bowl?â€ If it were up to me, Iâ€™d bowl once a week. You too, yeah? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. My husbandâ€™s amazing. He always turns the lights on right before we have sex. You know? I shut â€™em off, and he puts â€™em on. Finally, heâ€™s like, â€œWhy are you so shy? I love your body. All your scars.â€ â€œYouâ€™re beautiful.â€ You know? And I was like, â€œOh.â€ â€œYouâ€™re so cute. You think I donâ€™t want you to see me.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œBaby, my laser is about to kick in.â€ My husband actually just said these words to me before we had sex. He said, â€œDo you need me to go down on you?â€ â€œDo I need you to?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, I just saw Top Gun. Thanks.â€
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s hard to have sex with your spouse. Iâ€™ll say it. Because thatâ€™s your family. Itâ€™s like, we just had Thanksgiving together. Iâ€™m not gonna suck your dick. Youâ€™re my emergency contact for Christâ€™s sake!
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s disgusting. Canâ€™t talk dirty to each other anymore. We know each other too well. You know, Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m gonnaâ€¦â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, youâ€™re not.â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™m not.â€ â€œI want you to come all overâ€¦â€ â€œNo, you donâ€™t. No.â€ â€œNo, I donâ€™t.â€ We do a lot of roleplay. But I always pick the same role. You know, Iâ€™m always like, â€œOkay. Iâ€¦ am in a coma.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œGo.â€
[audience laughing]
I love him so much. I do. My husband is on the autism spectrum. Andâ€¦ Thank you. Thank you. It used to be called Aspergerâ€™s, but then they found out that Dr. Asperger had Nazi ties. Hate when that happens, right? Like some of our neighbors lately. Okay? Can we please love Jews? There arenâ€™t that many of us left. Okay?
[audience cheering]
So, yeah, heâ€™s on the autism spectrum. And, uhâ€¦ Itâ€™s called Autism Spectrum Disorder. And getting diagnosed has been so helpful to our family and to him, in helping us communicate. Making his life better, our life better, and heâ€™s so fucking cool and brave that heâ€™s down to be open about it, when thereâ€™s such a stigma, when itâ€™s so stupid. because heâ€™s my favorite person in the whole fucking world, other than my son, of course.
[audience cheering]
People donâ€™t know much about autism. They hear and go, â€œOh, does he love to count?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œShould we drop a bunch of straws on the floor andâ€¦ he can gather them and count them?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, fuck it. Do it. Might be fun. I donâ€™t know.â€ â€œIâ€™d like to check that out, personally.â€ Being diagnosed, getting tested, justâ€¦ itâ€™s helped us so much. Like, I understand his behavior now. You know? Like, when someoneâ€™s in the middle of a long, boring story, he will straight up just walk away.
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhereâ€™s this motherfucker going?â€ Never really lands a compliment with me. He tells me I look comfortable a lot. We just have different love languages. You know? Like, I was feeling kind of sentimental the other night. We were sitting outside. It wasâ€¦ a nice night. It looked like it was gonna rain, and, uhâ€¦ I just said, â€œYou know, baby, even though these last couple of years, raising a toddler during a pandemic, itâ€™s been so stressful. But still, getting to be with you, with our son, these have by far been the best years of my life.â€ And he just looked at me and he said, â€œIâ€™m gonna go put the windows up in the car.â€
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s my guy, you know? Yeah. Thatâ€™s when we play the game, â€œAutism, or Just a Man?â€ I donâ€™t know.
[audience laughing]
Right? This has been such a special, special show, special night. Iâ€™m gonna leave you with what he said to me right before I came out on stage tonight. I said, â€œBabeâ€¦ is this okay?â€ He said, â€œWell, itâ€™s too late.â€
[audience laughing]
Thank you so much, LA! I love you! I can stand you!

[music ends]
Philadelphia, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Oh my God, Iâ€™m so excited to be here, Philadelphia, you know, shoot my special. You know, my last special was in 2019. It was called Not Normal. Yeah. [sighing] Since then, weâ€™ve had a pandemic, an insurrection, Roe v. Wade got overturnedâ€¦
Yeah.
[audience booing]
Yeah, I should have called that special The Good Old Days.
[audience laughing]
Shit. What the fuck, yâ€™all? Monkeypox, lanternflies, flooding in California, Texas frozen overâ€¦ Kanyeâ€™s Black ass wearing a â€œWhite Lives Matterâ€ T-shirtâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I think Iâ€™m gonna call this special, Here Comes Jesus.
[audience laughing, cheering]
We lived through a pandemic, yâ€™all. What the fuck? And COVID was scary, â€™cause you didnâ€™t know what it was gonna do until you got it, right? And I finally got it. It took two years, and I finally got it. Yeah. You know, but Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m vaxxed, Iâ€™m fully vaccinated, so, you know, the first two days were a little rough. Iâ€™m isolating in the guest bedroom, you know, so my wife couldnâ€™t bother me, my kids couldnâ€™t bother me. So on that third day, I was like, â€œShit.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œHow can I get some of that long COVID?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œThis agrees with me.â€ â€œThis feels like me time.â€ Shit, Iâ€™ve been there just napping, you know, watching whatever I want. You know, my wife, she would leave my meals at the door. You know, she was like, â€œBabe, uh, why is there a towel underneath the door?â€ You know, â€™cause Iâ€™m in there smoking weed, you know, Iâ€™mâ€¦
[audience laughing, applauding] [coughing] â€œâ€˜Cause you donâ€™t want this shit!â€ â€œIâ€™m looking out for yâ€™all!â€ Then a couple of days later, she got it. Yeah. Yeah, she, she tells me, â€œBabe, uh, I just tested positive.â€ â€œSo, you know, I can, uhâ€¦ I can isolate with you.â€ I was like, â€œUh-uh.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYours is fresh. Iâ€™m on my way out.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYou hot.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s not how it works.â€ I said, â€œYou donâ€™t know. You ainâ€™t Sanjay Gupta.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œTake your ass back to our bedroom.â€ And then my son caught it. Yeah. And his twin sister, she didnâ€™t get it. Why? â€˜Cause sheâ€™s a 13-year-old girl and she donâ€™t want shit to do with us.
[audience laughing]
You should see her little ass, walking, like, 50 feet ahead of us, acting like sheâ€™s BeyoncÃ© and we Destinyâ€™s Child.
[audience laughing]
â™ª To the left, to the left â™ª
[chuckling] But you know what, thereâ€™s some things that I miss about being in the lockdown. I do. Remember we werenâ€™t letting anybody in your house, remember that? You didnâ€™t let nobody in your house. Uh-uh. And I miss that, â€™cause it was fun telling my white friends to go around back.
[audience laughing]
I loved that. â€œUh-uh, Carol, go around back now.â€ â€œYou know better than to come up here like that.â€ â€œYou go on around back now. Git! Go on.â€ â€œIâ€™ll meet you by the fire pit. Go ahead, now.â€ A lot of drinking by the fire pit. And there was some good stuff from the pandemic, right? We got online church. Oh, I love online church! Isnâ€™t that the best? But somehow Iâ€™m still late. I donâ€™t know how that happens. You just gotta log on, Wanda. Jeez! Love online church. Although Communion Sunday started to get out of hand. Yeah, yeah, you know, the pastor would say, you know, â€œGet your little wine, or your juice.â€ I was like, â€œUh, you said wine. Say less.â€ So I would sit there with my little shot glass of wine an, and my Ritz cracker, you know. Yeah, â€™cause the body of Christ is brown for me.
[audience laughing]
Yeah, Iâ€¦ I, I donâ€™t do Malibu Jesus, that blond-haired, blue-eyed guy. Uh-uh. No. Thatâ€™s just perpetuating white supremacy, thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s doing. Have you seen one of the early drawings of Jesus? He looks just like Teddy Pendergrass.
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s my Jesus. I donâ€™t do Jesus of Nebraska. No, thank you. So those first couple of, you know, COVID communions, I was good, but by that sixth month, boy, I was sitting there with a whole glass of a Cabernetâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€¦and an everything bagel. I was like, â€œWhat the hell, Wanda? What are you doing?â€ â€œThis is ridiculous.â€ You know, by the end of the service, a cheese plate went into the situation. I got a wine ring on my Bible. I was like, â€œOkayâ€¦â€ â€œI gotta get back in the building. I need supervision.â€ You know, Iâ€¦ I got a friend who still hasnâ€™t been vaccinated. No, she wonâ€™t get vaccinated. And sheâ€™s laughing at me. Sheâ€™s like, â€œUh, look at you.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t know whatâ€™s in that mess.â€ â€œYou just put that mess in your arm. You donâ€™t know whatâ€™s in it.â€ I was like, â€œYeah, I donâ€™t know.â€ â€œAnd if they told me what was in it, I still wouldnâ€™t know what was in it.â€ â€œIâ€™m not a scientist, jackass.â€
[audience laughing, applauding]
But they laugh at me. They laugh at me. They talk like, â€œWell, I just donâ€™t put anything in my body.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYou use Splenda. Shut the fuck up.â€
[audience laughing]
But you know, I wasnâ€™t afraid of the vaccine because I grew up with something called, uh, the mosquito man. Yeah. I grew up in Virginia, you know, rural area, and, uh, you know, we had the mosquito man. Like, the mosquito man comes around now, but they, you know, they call your house and leave a recording, and say theyâ€™re gonna come and, you know, treat the area, and to stay inside and bring your pets inside. Yeah. Not back then. Mm-mm. Back in the late â€™60s, they, they would just pop up. Yeah, and we lived back in the woods, you know, no, no streetlights, just dirt roads. You know, my grandmother didnâ€™t have indoor plumbing. So when the mosquito man came around, that was an exciting time for us. That was like the circus. You know what Iâ€™m saying? Itâ€™s like, other neighborhoods they would getâ€¦ [humming the ice-cream song] Mm-mm. Not us. We would getâ€¦ [imitating water sprinkler]
[audience laughing]
And we would lose our fucking minds. The kids, man, we would drop whatever we was doingâ€¦ â€œItâ€™s mosquito man!â€ â€œYeah, itâ€™s the mosquito man!â€ And we would run to the end of the road to greet the mosquito man just to get behind his truck to play in that fog of pesticide. [yelling] â€œYou canâ€™t see me!â€ We would play tag, just having the time of our lives. And the mosquito man was an asshole, right? Because instead of saying, â€œKids, get out of here!â€ â€œGo inside. This is poison!â€ He would shoot at us like it was a video game. [imitating shooting] That asshole would slow down and crank it up more so weâ€™d get a bigger fog. And weâ€™re just loving it. [laughing] Just running in it, mouth wide open. [chuckling] And then when he was leaving the neighborhood, we would thank him. â€œThank you, mosquito man! Thank you!â€ â€œCome back soon, okay?â€ And then weâ€™d walk back home, with that pesticide just steaming off of us. Flies would land on us and then just die.
[audience laughing]
So, I wasnâ€™t scared of no vaccine.
[audience cheering, applauding]
So Iâ€™m married, happily married. Married a French woman. Yeah, sheâ€™s French. And she, sheâ€™s white, sheâ€™s white, and, uhâ€¦ And we have twins, Lucas and Olivia. Theyâ€™re 13 now. Theyâ€™re white too. Yeah, you know. I figured if she was gonna carry them, they should look like her, you know? And also I felt like, you know, â€œHey, if shit didnâ€™t work out, it would be easier for me to walk away.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œItâ€™s like I was never there.â€ Sheâ€™s not gonna like that joke. And sheâ€™s really not gonna like that I put in my will that in order for the kids to get the money, they gotta legally change their names to Rashad and Laquisha.
[audience laughing]
[Wanda laughing] The kids are now in public school, yeah. Because, uh, since pre-K, they were going to the French School, because my wife was like, â€œOkay, so Iâ€™m the mother, and, uh, you know, the kids, they have to learn French first, â€™cause itâ€™s the tongue of the mother.â€ â€œSo, uh, they have to go to the private French school, okay?â€ And I was like, â€œYeah, thatâ€™s cool. You know, French first, okay.â€ My friends were like, â€œWhat you mean, â€˜French firstâ€™?â€ I was like, â€œWould you shut the hell up? I know what Iâ€™m doing.â€ Anyways, I felt like the kids would bring me some homework and Iâ€™d just goâ€¦ [grunting]
[audience laughing]
â€œGo ask the other one.â€ But the kids are now fluent, so my wifeâ€¦ You know, when they were going to middle school, she came to me, sheâ€™s like, â€œOkay, so the kids are now fluent in French, and I think itâ€™s time that they can go to the public school.â€ â€œUm, is that okay for you?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, itâ€™s more than okay for me, â€™cause by looking at these report cards, I can get these Câ€™s for free.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œJudging by this, we ainâ€™t raising no little Dr. Faucis over here.â€ â€œI think we got us a couple of TikTokers.â€ â€œThatâ€™s what weâ€™re working with.â€ But we did take a tour of the school before we made our decision, you know. So we went to check out the school. Weâ€™re walking through, and they had, like, the, they had the rainbow flag up, and they had the transgender flag, they had the hands across the world, you know, holding hands, and my wife is looking at it. She was like, â€œOh!â€ â€œThis is nice. I like this. I think it, I think it matches our values, and, uhâ€¦â€ â€œI think itâ€™s a good environment for the kids.â€ â€œWhat do you think, babe? What you think?â€ And I was like, â€œWell, first of all, you know you ainâ€™t supposed to be smoking in here.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œPublic building. What you doing?â€ And I was like, â€œI canâ€™t believe youâ€™re falling for this shit.â€ â€œYou know they just put this up â€™cause they knew we were coming.â€ â€œYou take that rainbow flag down, there is a Trump 2024 poster back there.â€
[audience laughing]
But it turns out, I was wrong. That is the mission of the school, inclusivity. Yeah.
[audience applauding]
And it really touched me, you know? â€˜Cause I was like, â€œMan, just think, I mean, like, how my life would be different, you know, if it were like that when I was coming up?â€ Like, if Iâ€¦ If I was able to go to a school like that. I was like, â€œMan, I couldâ€™ve saved myself a lot of unnecessary dick in my life.â€
[audience laughing]
[audience whooping]
I didnâ€™t, I didnâ€™t need all that dick! That dick werenâ€™t for me. That was Carolâ€™s dick. That wasnâ€™t my dick. Because I knew, I knew. Iâ€¦ I knew in the third grade. Yeah. I remember having a crush on, uh, my brotherâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s, uh, sister. She was an older girl, and I remember telling her, you know, Iâ€¦ I said, â€œYou know, I wish I were a boy and then you could be my girlfriend.â€ Yeah. Cute, right? That bitch shut me down. Oh my gosh, she crushed me. She was like, â€œYou donâ€™t say that. Thatâ€™s disgusting.â€ â€œThatâ€™s nasty. Youâ€™re nasty.â€ You donâ€™t like girls, you like boys. You donâ€™t like girls, you like boys.â€ And, and I was like, â€œOkay,â€ you know. â€œI guess Iâ€™ll put this in a box.â€ â€œDeal with it when I can afford therapy.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œI guess bring on the dick.â€
[audience laughing]
And even then, it took me a long time. Like, I was a, I was a virgin until I was a junior in college. Yeah. And even then, I was just like, â€œLet me just get this over with.â€ And I found the shortest guy with the littlest hands I could find.
[audience laughing]
Teeny hands. â€˜Cause I was like, you know, â€œI ainâ€™t trying to have a whole meal.â€ I was just looking for toppers, you know. Just do toppers. And he was nice, he was nice, so then I started having sex with guys, you know. But you know, it never really did anything for me, but they seemed to enjoy it.
[audience laughing]
And I guess that was enough for me, â€™cause, you know, Iâ€™m an entertainer.
[audience laughing]
[audience cheering, applauding]
Iâ€™ll give you a show. But these kids know, man. These kids know. My daughter has a, has a friend, little gay boy, Justin. Yeah. I was talking to my wife. I said, â€œYou know, Oliviaâ€™s gonna ask us if Justin can come over for a sleepover.â€ â€œHow do you feel about that? Sheâ€™s like, â€œWellâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYou know, Justinâ€¦â€ [speaking French] â€œâ€¦and, you know, I like his parents, soâ€¦â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™m okay. Are you okay?â€ I was like, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m okay with it.â€ I said, â€œBut I will have a conversation with Justin when he gets here.â€ â€œIâ€™ll be like, â€˜Look, Justin, now when you walked through my door, you were gay.'â€
[audience laughing]
â€œâ€˜Thatâ€™s how you better leave here in the morning.'â€
[audience laughing]
â€œâ€˜All right?'â€ â€œâ€˜I donâ€™t wanna hear no bi-curious shit over breakfast.'â€ These kids know, man. And they out there trying to go backwards, right? Florida. â€œDonâ€™t Say Gayâ€ ban. What the hell, right? Tennessee, no kids can go to the drag shows. Like that was a problem in the first place. Oh, I canâ€™t tell you how many drag shows Iâ€™ve been to and everybodyâ€™s up in arms because they ran out of highchairs and booster seats. What the fuck is wrong with them? At the library, they even stopped the, the drag queenâ€™s, uh, story hour. They were reading books to kids, and they stopped that. They said, â€œWell, a man dressed as a woman is confusing to kids.â€ Well, have you seen Sesame Street?
[audience laughing]
I think if the kids can figure out Snuffleupagus, they can handle RuPaul.
[audience laughing, applauding]
Texas. Theyâ€™re banning books in Texas. Banning books. â€œWell, weâ€™re protecting the kids.â€ Well, if you really want to protect the kids, ban assault weapons, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s killing the kids. Not the books. [audience cheering, applauding] I mean, until a drag queen walks into a school and beats eight kids to death with a copy of To Kill a Mockingbirdâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I think youâ€™re focusing on the wrong shit.
[audience cheering, applauding]
And youâ€™re not protecting the kids. Youâ€™re protecting homophobia, thatâ€™s what youâ€™re protecting. And transphobia is rampant. Hundreds of bills being introduced across the country, and it seems like it, it comes down to bathrooms. They really donâ€™t want trans women to use the ladiesâ€™ room. Let me tell you something. For anybody whoâ€™s ever been to a ladiesâ€™ room, there ainâ€™t nothing ladylike in there. If you go into a public ladiesâ€™ room and itâ€™s clean, you better play the lottery, â€™cause you got lucky. I donâ€™t know what the fuck happens to women when we go into that restroom. Itâ€™s like, you could see a woman, she could be in, in heels and, and a fucking gown and a, and a tiara. As soon as she crosses that threshold of the ladiesâ€™ room, itâ€™sâ€¦ [growling, groaning]
[audience laughing]
What the fuck? Would it kill you to flush, ladies? Just a flush, please! And itâ€™s always that one stall, where the door is just slightly ajar. Ooh, you donâ€™t go in there. Somethingâ€™s God-awful in there. And thereâ€™s always that one woman in line who just canâ€™t wait, and sheâ€™s likeâ€¦ â€œUm, ladies, is, is, is anyone using that one?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œGo ahead.â€ â€œKnock yourself out, Nancy Drew. Go ahead.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, thank you! Thank youâ€ â€œOh, God! Oh, God!!â€ [gagging] Dumbass. Iâ€¦ I went into one stall, and everything was clean, except there was a, a puddle of pee on the floor. I was like, â€œWhat the fuck happened here?â€ And I thought about it. I was like, â€œI know what.â€ â€œShe probably lost her hover skills.â€
[audience laughing]
She probably was in there hovering, and that knee went out on her. [groaning] â€œDamn it! Aahâ€ â€œOh shit.â€ â€œI got pee in my shoe.â€ â€œDamn it.â€ â€œThis is some bullshit.â€ And sometimes your hover skills can be on point, but, you know, our bodies are so complex that, you know, I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a wild hair or something, but sometimes you go, and you get two streams coming out. Oneâ€™s going down your thigh, oneâ€™s shooting out that way. Like, what theâ€¦ And then you try to marry it together, like, â€œCome on, yâ€™all!â€ â€œCome on. Come on, work with me, yâ€™all, come on.â€ â€œAh, shit. Damn it, this is someâ€¦â€ [groaning] â€œAll right, comeâ€¦ All right, come on.â€ Ah. Peeing like a scorpion, youâ€™re like, â€œThis is someâ€¦â€ â€œPee just went in my booty hole. This is not right.â€ â€œThis is not right.â€ And then, and then when you give up and say, â€œIâ€™m just gonna use a seat cover,â€ you go in there and put the seat cover down, and as soon as you turn aroundâ€¦ [imitating water flushing] â€¦the toilet flush and snatches your seat cover!
[audience laughing]
Youâ€™re like, â€œShit, Iâ€™m just gonna pee on the floor. Fuck this.â€ So I welcome my trans sisters into the ladiesâ€™ room. Please. Maybe, maybe youâ€™ll make us do better, you know. Weâ€™ll be like, â€œCome on, ladies!â€ â€œLetâ€™s pick it up around here.â€ â€œWe got some new members coming in, come on.â€ My son, Lucas, heâ€™s been, uh, begging me for a snake. Yeah, thatâ€™s it. For years. For years, a snake. Yeah. Yeah. â€œMommy-boo, can I please have a snake?â€ Yeah, they still call me â€œMommy-booâ€ â€™cause theyâ€™re racist, you know.
[audience laughing]
And Iâ€™m like, â€œLucas, youâ€™re not getting a snake.â€ Every Christmas, â€œMommyâ€¦â€ Every birthday, â€œCan I have a snake?â€ And I finally just snapped. I was like, â€œLook, Lucas, youâ€™re not getting a snake!â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œWhy?â€ I said, â€œâ€˜Cause Iâ€™m just not gonna let you be that white.â€
[audience laughing]
And I had to break it down for him. I said, â€œLook, man, you, you, you have a Black mother, okay?â€ â€œBlack women just donâ€™t tolerate stupid shit.â€ â€œIt makes our ass itch.â€ â€œI mean, getting a snake and bringing it in the house and calling it a pet?â€ â€œThatâ€™s dumb.â€ â€œThatâ€™s just dumb. Know what else youâ€™re not gonna do?â€ â€œExtreme sports. You can forget about that.â€ â€œI ainâ€™t buying you a bike, and now you up there flipping all up in the air.â€ â€œThatâ€™s not the way that bikeâ€™s supposed to be ridden. You ainâ€™t doing that.â€ And then he goes, â€œUh, is that why you wonâ€™t let me wear shorts when itâ€™s cold?â€ â€œExactly, Rashad. Exactly.â€
[audience laughing]
Heâ€™s like, â€œRashad?â€ I said, â€œDonâ€™t worry, youâ€¦ Youâ€™ll find out. Youâ€™ll find out.â€ I tell you, lockdown was rough for me. It was. It was rough, man. â€˜Cause everything racial popped off, right? George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery. The countryâ€™s on fire. And Iâ€™m stuck in the house with white people.
[audience laughing]
And Ahmaud Arbery put me over the edge, man. That, that one broke me. So, you know, I was outside, standing by the fire pit, upset, drinking, Wearing my â€œI Matterâ€ T-shirt.
[audience laughing]
And my wife comes outside. She comes over, she goes, â€œUh, babe?â€ â€œI know youâ€™re upset and all, you know, about, uhâ€¦â€ â€œAbout all the racism and all, and, you knowâ€¦â€ â€œYou know, Iâ€™m sorry, uh, you know, thatâ€¦â€ â€œThat, you knowâ€¦â€ â€œYou knowâ€¦â€ â€œRacism.â€ â€œBut, you know, the kids, they are, theyâ€™re a little worried about you.â€ â€œThey say, â€˜Why Mommy-boo upset?'â€ â€œSo, you know, maybe you can go talk to them about the, um, you know, racism.â€ I looked at her, I said, â€œYou know what, Alex, why donâ€™t you go talk to them about the racism?â€ â€œâ€˜Cause I canâ€™t explain things that are being done to me.â€ â€œI canâ€™t explain that, so why donâ€™t you go talk to them?â€ â€œA matter of fact, why donâ€™t you go talk to them about white supremacy and make sure we ainâ€™t raising a Proud Boy up in this motherfucker?â€ â€œWhy donâ€™t you go do that?â€
[audience cheering, applauding]
Huh.
[audience laughing]
â€œI can make us some crÃªpes.â€ She made crÃªpes. And they were delicious. But I get it, though. I get it. I get it. â€˜Cause itâ€™s uncomfortable to talk about, right? And I was sick of explaining it to her, so I said, â€œYou know what?â€ â€œIâ€™m just gonna start pointing shit out for her.â€ So we had to go to the bank to drop some paperwork off, right? So my wife is driving, Iâ€™m in the car. We pull up to the bank. And I noticed the parking lot was kind of scarce, and I didnâ€™t see anyâ€¦ any activity going on in the bank. So sheâ€™s like, â€œYeah, just go, you knowâ€¦ just take the papers in the bank and, uh, okay, just drop it off.â€ And Iâ€™m looking, Iâ€™m like, â€œAre you sure itâ€™s open?â€ â€œI think so.â€ â€œYou know, justâ€¦ just go and, uhâ€¦â€ â€œI am not going up to a bank andâ€¦â€ â€œBut, but why?â€ â€œâ€˜Cause Black people donâ€™t go up to banks andâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYou know why? â€˜Cause somebody will call the cops and say, â€œHey, thereâ€™s a Black woman trying to break into the bank.'â€ â€œâ€˜She looks like Wanda Sykes.'â€
[audience laughing]
She didnâ€™t get it. She didnâ€™t get it. She thought I was being ridiculous. Yeah. But I understand why, because she does whatever the fuck she wants to do. Yeah. We were in France, right? Had to go to the grocery store. Weâ€™re about to cross the street, the dudeâ€™s closing the gate of the store. And I go, â€œAh, babe, weâ€™re too late.â€ She said, â€œNo, weâ€™re not.â€ She ran across the streetâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I backed the fuck up and went home. Like, America home. But thatâ€™s how she rolls. And then something happened that, that got to her. We were, uh, standing in the backyard or whatever, and during, during the shutdown, they built three new homes next to us. Big homes, right? So my wife is standing out in back, and sheâ€™s looking at the house, and sheâ€™s likeâ€¦ [grunting] â€œHey, babe, I think, uh, â€œI think that window is going to be a problem because, uh, they can see into our, uh, master bath.â€ â€œI donâ€™t, I donâ€™t like that window.â€ And I was like, â€œWell, babe, I mean, we have window treatment, itâ€™s cool.â€ â€œWeâ€™ll just close our blinds, itâ€™s all good.â€ Hmm. Hmm. And when she does that â€œHmm, hmmâ€, oh, it ainâ€™t over. She ainâ€™t letting it go. Right? And she didnâ€™t. A couple days later, Iâ€™m in the house, my phone rings. Itâ€™s Alex. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy is she calling me? Sheâ€™s home.â€ So Iâ€™m like, â€œHey, babe, you, you okay?â€ â€œYes. Uh, can you go up to our master bath and look out the window, please?â€ So I go upstairs. I open the blinds. There she is in the house being under construction. Sheâ€™s in the window over there. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are you doing?â€ Sheâ€™s like, whoo-hoo.
[audience laughing]
â€œI can see you!â€ â€œYou see me?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œGet out of that house!â€ â€œOh, I just wanted to see. I told you this was going to be a problem.â€ â€œGet out of that house!â€ â€œOkay, okay.â€ So she comes home. I am livid, right? Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat is your problem?â€ I said, â€œDo you know what you just did?â€ I said, â€œYou did exactly what Ahmaud Arbery did.â€ â€œThere was a house under construction, heâ€™s being nosy, checking it out.â€ I said, â€œBut when he left, they chased him down and murdered him in the middle of the street.â€ â€œIf they caught you in that house, they wouldâ€™ve chased you down and asked if you wanted to see the other two models.â€
[audience laughing]
She got it. She got it then. She was like, â€œOh shit.â€ Yeah, she dropped her accent and everything. Put her cigarette out, and punched Carol in the liver. I was like, â€œDamn!â€ She got it. She got it. Yeah. She realized itâ€™s privilege, you know, itâ€™s privilege. She can do what I canâ€™t do, you know, without consequences, right? Like, like, like Black people canâ€™t be weird. We canâ€™t. We have, we have to fit the stereotype. We donâ€™t fit the stereotype, it freaks people out. Itâ€¦ Itâ€™s like how people are blown away that Lizzo can play the flute.
[audience laughing]
â€œDid you know that Lizzo can play the flute?â€ â€œReally?â€ â€œYes, an actual flute!â€ â€œShe doesnâ€™t even play it with her asshole or anything, she just plays the flute.â€ â€œLike, classical.â€ Canâ€™t be weird. Look at Elijah McClain. Elijah McClain, young Black man in Aurora. Yeah. He was, uh, walking home, it was cold outside, had a little jacket on. He was walking home and he was listening to his music. He was waving his hands, walking, listening to his music, walking home, minding his business. Somebody called the cops. â€œHey, thereâ€™s a Black guy acting weird.â€ â€œSeems sketchy.â€ So the cops show up. They question him, and, and, and Elijahâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m fine. Iâ€™m fine.â€ â€œIâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m an introvert, Iâ€™m fine.â€ Cops think heâ€™s on drugs, so they call the paramedics. Paramedics hold him down, shoot him up with ketamine, killed him. Yeah, just for being weird. Then the cops tried to justify it. â€œWell, I mean, it was cold outside. He had on a little, thin jacket.â€ Like, well, what about those people at the Green Bay Packer games? Standing outside in the snowbank, no shirt on, with a block of styrofoam cheese on their head? Thatâ€™s some weird shit. White people do weird shit all the time. Renaissance fairs, what the fuck is that?
[audience laughing]
I donâ€™t get it. You know what was weird? You know what was weird? That fucking, uh, uh, shaman guy. On January sixth, that shaman motherfucker. Half man, half horse, what the fuck was that? His face was painted, uh, blue and white, whatever, wearing that fucking flag, got fucking hat with horns on it and shit. You know, where was the call to the cops for that guy? â€œHey, thereâ€™s a weird motherfucker about to leave his house.â€ â€œThis is some crazy shit.â€ Whereâ€™s the call for that guy? He shouldnâ€™t even made it to DC. They shouldâ€™ve shot him as soon as he walked out of his door. Tagged him and put him in the zoo.
[audience laughing]
[Wanda laughing] Oh my gosh. January sixth, man. Wow. That was someâ€¦ That was the epitome of, of white privilege like that, right there. That was the epitome of white privilege. January sixthâ€¦
[audience cheering, applauding]
Never seen no shit like that. Black people were watching January sixth like, â€œWhat in the Wakanda forever is going on here?â€ I mean, they were just climbing up the walls, I mean, just scaling the walls of the Capitol. And I mean, it, it looked like a, a zombie herd. They looked like a zombie herd, man. You know, just, just like theyâ€™d been bit, you know, like Giuliani bit all of them. They were just infected. They had that crazed look in their eyes, you know. â€œNancy!â€ â€œNancy!â€ You know, hair dye dripping down the side of their face. â€œNancy!â€
[audience laughing]
You know what was really bad about January sixth? Look at our congresspeople. Theyâ€™re old. You canâ€™t scare old people like that! Yâ€™all, they made old people hide. You know how painful that is? I remember when I turned 50, Iâ€™m playing hide-and-seek with my kids. Iâ€™m stuck underneath a coffee table. After a while, I was like, â€œShit, this shit hurts.â€ I started making noise. â€œHey, Iâ€™m over here!â€ â€œCome find my ass!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI ainâ€™t playing this shit no more.â€ I mean, come on, you canâ€™t tell Chuck Grassley to scramble. â€œCome on, Chuck, we gotta hide. Letâ€™s go!â€ â€œHuh?â€ â€œWhat? Uh-ha.â€ â€œWhat did you say? Ha?â€ â€œGotta hide, huh?â€ They all should have just hid under Mitch McConnellâ€™s chin. Never wouldâ€™ve found them there.
[audience laughing, cheering]
Now, now watch some Democrat come at me for making fun of Mitch McConnellâ€™s chin. Yeah. Theyâ€™d probably be like Cory Booker or somebody, you know, on his IG run. â€œYou know, taking jabs at jowls does not move the conversation forward.â€
[audience laughing]
Annoying! You know thatâ€™ll happen, because when they go low, we go high, right? Yeah. Thatâ€™s bullshit. Iâ€™m sick of that! Sick of going high! I want to go low, I want to have some fun! â€˜Cause being a Democrat is painful, yâ€™all. Itâ€™s painâ€¦ Itâ€™s like getting a wedgie every fucking day. Just got to take it! â€˜Cause they make up all kinds of shit, but why do we have to be handcuffed to, to facts and reality when theyâ€™re living in some alternate universe, just making up shit? â€˜Cause, you know, politics is just straight-up entertainment now, especially on the Republican side. A, Aâ€¦ All theyâ€™re doing is entertaining. You know what itâ€™s like? Itâ€™s like the Dems are PBS, and the GOP is TLC. Man, I could watch TLC all day! That shit is fun. What would you rather watch, PBS NewsHour Or Dr. Pimple Popper?
[audience laughing]
Huh? Frontline or Sex Sent Me to the ER? Masterpiece Theatre or 90 Day FiancÃ©? Even Democrats make it hard to be Democrats. You know, like Kyrsten Sinema. Switched parties now. Independent. Yeah. You know, she was, uh, she was at some forum, and she was talking about the differences between the House and the Senate, and she said the Senate has to cool the, the passions of the people, because the worst thing you can do is give a child everything it wants. Yeah, thatâ€™s bullshit. Thatâ€™s why she shouldnâ€™t be in office. If she thinks of the voters as children, thatâ€™s bullshit. You know, I donâ€™t think asking for tax reform and, and making billionaires pay their fair share, I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s childish, right? And children ask for stupid shit. You know what my kids asked me one time? They asked me if they could eat their breakfast before they go to bed so they could sleep in.
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m telling you, politics, man, sometimes you gotta turn it off. Gotta turn it off just to protect your mental health. Yeah. Likeâ€¦ Yes. I had to turn it off because I was getting triggered. I was getting triggered. Know what my trigger was? Red hats. Fuck Santa Claus!
[audience laughing]
I see a red hat, my fist would just ball up. I didnâ€™t even know I was making a fist. I figured it out when I was at brunch, and, uh, some guy was like, â€œHey, Wanda!â€ And I turned around, and he had on a red hat. And I was like, â€œWhat!â€ And he was like, â€œOh, Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m just a Curb fan, Iâ€™m sorry.â€ And I was like, â€œUh, okay, thanks, man.â€ And now I feel like shit, right? So I was like, â€œLet me go over and talk to this man.â€ Right? He was in profile, so, Iâ€™m walking over and, and I see the red hat, and he sees me coming and he starts to turn. And I see white lettering on his hat. And I was like, â€œOh, this motherfucker here.â€ So Iâ€™m making a fist. And then I got closer. He turns around. The hat said, â€œMake a Wish Foundation.â€
[audience laughing]
I was like, â€œHey, man, you want to take a picture, want me to sign something?â€ â€œHow about a hand job? Iâ€™m an entertainer!â€
[audience laughing]
The country is so divided. Itâ€™s fear, man. Itâ€™s fear. Thatâ€™s why you see so many of these red states, you know, they want to ban, uh, critical race theory being taught in school. Yeah. DeSantis, Marjorie Taylor Greeneâ€¦ Yeah. They say itâ€™s teaching white kids to feel bad or shame for being white. Thatâ€™s nonsense. â€˜Cause there are white kids out there who are proud of their grandparents who marched with Dr. King and who was on those buses with those Freedom Riders, right? That risked their lives. And look, weâ€™re here in Pennsylvania. What about the Quakers? The Quakers, the Quakers are abolitionists, and, and they helped Harriet Tubman. They, they would hide slaves in their homes. Come on. And, and letâ€™s not forget about their delicious oats.
[audience laughing]
So I donâ€™t think people like DeSantis, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Glenn Youngkin from my home state of Virginiaâ€¦ I donâ€™t think theyâ€™re worried that, uh, you know, CRT will make white kids feel ashamed of being white. Theyâ€™re worried it will make their kids ashamed of them.
[audience applauding]
And we canâ€™t come together until we deal with white supremacy, right? Itsâ€¦ America, I mean, come on, we have to face our history and all the awful shit that happened. Thatâ€™s the only way we can move forward, because right now, America is like living in a horror movie. Yeah, itâ€™s like I Know What You Did Last Summer. But more like, I Know What You Did the Last 400 Summers. Right? Itâ€™s like Americaâ€™s at that campground, walking throughâ€¦ â€œHello?â€ â€œIs, is anybody there?â€ And then reparations just jumps out at you. [growling, grunting] â€œHello, Karen!â€ â€œBrad.â€
[audience laughing]
[Wanda chuckling] Reparations. And you know what? Whenever reparations are brought up, we always hear the, hear the pushback, and the argument is always, â€œWhy should I have to pay for something that I had nothing to do with?â€ Okay, well, some of you have trust funds. You ainâ€™t earned that. Some of you have homes and businesses that you didnâ€™t build, but theyâ€™ve been passed down generation for generation in your family, right? Great-Great-Grandpappy left you something. But you accept it. So, think of reparations as part of your inheritance.
[audience laughing, cheering]
Comes with the package. For white supremacists, I think their biggest fearâ€¦ They, they know that one day, they will be the minority. And thatâ€™s scary, â€™cause they see how shitty it is. Oh, youâ€™ve seen the videos. And theyâ€™re afraid, like, maybe weâ€™ll treat them the way they treated us. But thatâ€™s, thatâ€™s ridiculous, because Black people, we donâ€™t even think like that. We donâ€™t sit around talking about retribution and what weâ€™re gonna do to them. No! Well, at least not at the last meeting, we didnâ€™t do that.
[audience laughing]
And I think Black people, over and over again, have demonstrated who we are, right? Right, look, look at the Emanuel eight, those beautiful Black people who were gunned down in their church, by Bible study. And what did they do? Hours after it happened, theyâ€™re in court telling that guy, that, that white supremacist, that they forgive him. â€œWe forgive you. We forgive you.â€ And I know some of yâ€™all are like, â€œWell, not all Black people, Wanda.â€ â€œHow about that woman who went off on Jeffrey Dahmer?â€ I mean, yeah, I remember her. You knowâ€¦ â€œI hate you, Jeffrey!â€ I remember that. But come on, he ate her brother!
[audience laughing]
Well, Black people donâ€™t think like that. We donâ€™t. And plus, letâ€™s be honest. White people would make the worst slaves on the face of the planet.
[audience laughing]
â€œOoh, my carpel tunnel is acting up today.â€ â€œI donâ€™t think I canâ€¦ I canâ€™tâ€¦â€ â€œItâ€™s excruciating pain, I canâ€™tâ€¦â€ Theyâ€™ll be leaving the fields early. â€œHey, hey, where you going?â€ â€œUh, Harry Styles tickets, hello!â€ â€œGet your ass back here!â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna need to see your supervisor.â€ So, Iâ€™m still in menopause. Yep. Breaking news. Just fighting off those hot flashes. But you know what angers me the most is when Iâ€™m watching TV, and I see all these commercials for men. Theyâ€™re always fixing something for the dudes, you know? Yeah. And a lot of it, I donâ€™t really see it as a problem. Yeah. Like, you know theyâ€™re, uh, fixing, uh, bent dicks now, did you know that? Have you seen that ad with the, with the bent carrot?
[audience laughing]
Who knew that was an issue? Theyâ€™re fixing bent dicks now. I say, â€œFuck you.â€ I donâ€™t give a shit about your bent dick. Thatâ€¦ I think gout is more important than that. How did that even get on the to-do list, bent dicks? â€œAh, poor Peter has a banana dick. Aah.â€ â€œItâ€™s not funny, Wanda, it can cause infertility and painfulâ€¦â€ I donâ€™t give a shit. I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t care about your crooked dick, your hooked dick, your bent dick, banana dick, I donâ€™t give a fuck. Iâ€™m over here growing a full beard, sweating through my sheets every night. Fuck you and your hooked dick. I donâ€™t give a shit if your dick curves so much that when you bend over, you fuck yourself in the ass. I donâ€™t care! I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t. Suffer in silence, please.
[audience laughing]
I was talking to my gynecologist about it. I was like, â€œWhat treatments are out there?â€ You know, because I canâ€™t take the, you know, the patch or the hormones because of the type of breast cancer I had, right? So I canâ€™t take them. So my doctor said, â€œNow theyâ€™re giving women, um, microdoses of Xanax now, and that seems to help with the hot flashes.â€ I said, â€œOh, okay, so itâ€™s the straight hysterical woman syndrome, huh?â€ So theyâ€™re like, â€œHere, you crazy bitches, maybe this will calm you down.â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m not taking that. So thatâ€™s why I kind of wish that, that menâ€¦ Okay, I donâ€™t wish, I pray, that men would go through a little menopause, you know? â€˜Cause then maybe theyâ€™ll find something to help us. Right? Like, what, what if, uh, if guys, likeâ€¦ Okay, letâ€™s just say, like, one, one of your testicles, right? Letâ€™s just say one of your testicles would just start throbbing a little bit. So youâ€™ll know itâ€™s coming. Like itâ€™d have, like, an aura to it. And then all of a sudden, it, it swells up, and whoosh! It catches on fire. You know? You have, like, a nut flash, just whoosh! And, and it could be the right one, it could be the left one, you never know. And, and it happens, like, six, seven times a day. Just, that thing just going like that. Whoosh! You go, â€œOh shit!â€ â€œNut flash! Nut flash!â€ I would love that. But you know, theyâ€™d give them some relief, right? Theyâ€™ll probably start making underwear with little fans in them or something. Or just make it legal where guys can walk around with their nuts out. Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, my God, his nuts are out!â€ â€œItâ€™s okay. Heâ€™s going through something.â€ â€œHe has a note from his doctor. Leave the man alone.â€ You know those lactation stations you see at the airport? Theyâ€™ll shut those down. Yeah. Theyâ€™ll become ball-cooling rooms. Youâ€™ll see dudes in there justâ€¦ Whoooâ€¦ â€œUh, this is a doozy. Oh, boy.â€ â€œHowâ€™s it going, Pete?â€ â€œOh man, itâ€™s bad. Itâ€™s bad. Itâ€™s bad.â€ â€œHey, Pete, did you do something different with your penis?â€ â€œYeah, I got that hook out. You noticed that?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œHeâ€™s straight as an arrow now.â€ â€œLooking good.â€ I would love to see a dude in this board meeting. You know? â€œOkay, all right, now forâ€¦ Letâ€™s go over first quarter earnings.â€ â€œIf you look, uh, you see sales were up.â€ â€œSales were up by 22%, and that, umâ€¦â€ Hmm. â€œThat, uhâ€¦â€ â€œThat totally crushed what our target was, 22%. Soâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œBut if, if we look at, uh, transportation, transportation, uh, went way up, and, uh, wasnâ€™t expecting that, so that really, uhâ€¦ Hmmâ€ â€œThat cut into a lot of our sales, so, umâ€¦â€ [groaning] â€œIâ€™m sorry, guys, Iâ€™m having a nut flash.â€
[audience laughing]
[moaning] â€œWow!â€ â€œWhoo. This is a bad one. Oh, my God.â€ â€œHank, get over here and blow on my balls, please.â€ So, I saw my doctor recently, and, uh, my breast doctor, because itâ€™s time to replace my breasts. Yeah. I got too many miles on these. Soâ€¦ So he said, so he said, â€œItâ€™s time to replace them.â€ But he gave me an option. He said, â€œWanda, look, youâ€™re, youâ€™re 59, and, uh, we can put more implants in, but I mean, do you want to have to do this surgery again in another 13, 14 years?â€ â€œI mean, youâ€™ll be kind of up there.â€ I was like, â€œYeahâ€¦â€ He said, â€œSo what I can do, I can take tissue from your midsection and make you some, you know, nice breasts.â€ And I was like, â€œWell, first of all, thank you for calling it tissue.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œVery professional on your part.â€ But then Iâ€¦ I heard some rumblings, and it was Esther. For those of you who donâ€™t know Esther, when I got in my forties, I got this fat roll. It ainâ€™t going nowhere, so I just named it. This is Esther. Esther loves bread, alcohol, and cheesecake. Thatâ€™s all she wants. â€œWhere my drink!â€ â€œI want some cheesecake!â€ So, so I heard Esther rumbling, and she was like, â€œWhatâ€™d he say?â€ I was like, â€œEsther, heâ€™s not talking to you, heâ€™s not talking to you.â€ And I told the doctor, I was like, â€œEmail me, email me.â€ I said, â€œEmail me, â€™cause Esther canâ€™t read. Email me.â€ â€œEmail me the details, right?â€ So, uh, cause you know, I think Iâ€™m gonna do it, it makes sense, you know. But then Iâ€¦ I get nervous, â€™cause I keep having these thoughts, you know, like, â€œWhat if I take Esther and put her up here, and she tries to choke me to death in my sleep?â€ You know, Estherâ€™d be like, â€œI hate you!â€ â€œI canâ€™t taste nothing up here. I hate you!â€ Or what if she, she gets losâ€¦ You know, she longs for home and she works her way back down? You know, and I have some long, droopy titties? You know. Esther be up here just doing squats. [grunting] Trying to get back down. â€œIâ€™m back, baby!â€ You know. But I think Iâ€™m gonna do it. I think Iâ€™m gonna do it. Yeah. â€˜Cause you knowâ€¦ Yeah!
[audience applauding]
Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t want to be in my seventies, you knowâ€¦ Yâ€™all watching online church, and the pastorâ€™s like, â€œUh, Saints, letâ€™s pray for Sister Sykes.â€ â€œSheâ€™s getting her new titties on Tuesday.â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m grateful that I have good doctors. I do. Theyâ€™re good doctors. And thatâ€™s important, you know? Although I did have to, uh, change gynecologists, â€™cause my old gynecologist, oof, she was, she was just chatty. Just talked too much, you know, likeâ€¦ I donâ€™t mind talking before the exam starts. But once I get in the stirrups, you shut the fuck up.
[audience laughing]
And sometimes, those exams, they gotta check the front and the backâ€¦ You just leave. You know what you did. Get the hell out of here. Donâ€™t even look at me! But this doctor, man, she was just too, too chatty, you know? Itâ€™s like, she would talk like we were good friends or something. You know, Iâ€¦ I get in there, and Iâ€™mâ€¦ and Iâ€™m in the stirrups, Iâ€™m in the stirrups, and sheâ€™s like, um, â€œHey, Wanda, you know, they just opened a Greek restaurant on the corner.â€ â€œMaybe if you have some time, you could stop and get some lunch.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIs this bitch really talking hummus?â€ So then I started having thoughts. I was like, â€œYou know what, Iâ€™m gonna make her feel as uncomfortable as she makes me feel.â€ So I was like, â€œYou know, one day, she gonna start talking, and Iâ€™m just gonna take my big toe and brush her bangs back.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œHey, girl.â€ â€œYou streaming anything good lately?â€
Hey, Philadelphia, thank yâ€™all so much! I love you! Thank you!
[audience cheering, applauding]
[upbeat music playing]
Thank you!
[Wanda] Oy, vey. And up. Use your knees, Page. Come on, push it.
<END>

<START>
[John Mulaney] The past couple years, Iâ€™ve done a lot of work on myself. And Iâ€™ve realized that Iâ€™ll be fine as long as I get constant attention.
[laughter]
I do. I love attention. I always wanted attention.
[laughter]
When I was a little kid, I didnâ€™t get enough attention. I was the third of four kids. I have an older brother and an older sister. When I was three years old, they pulled me aside and they told me that I was adopted. [laughter] And that my real mother had been murderedâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦by Miss America. They said, â€œIf you ask our mom about it, sheâ€™ll get really upset. So donâ€™t ask her if itâ€™s true unless you want to upset her.â€ And they said, â€œIf you ask our dad about it, heâ€™ll say that weâ€™re lying.â€ â€œBut heâ€™s lying.â€
[laughter]
They thought of every angle. [laughter] And to compound the stress that I was under, when I was three years old, I thought that Miss America was the Statue of Liberty.
[laughter]
And that summer was 1986. In â€™86 that summer on the Fourth of July, Reagan was president then, and he gave a speech in front of the Statue of Liberty. He was wearing a white shirt, the wind was blowing, and he goesâ€¦ [as Ronald Regan] â€œThis lady is a great lady.â€ And I was sitting at home like, â€œOh, my God.â€ â€œThis goes all the way to the top.â€
[laughter]
â€œIâ€™m never gonna get justice for my mother.â€ I always wanted attention in school, like to a sick degree. I reallyâ€¦ I mean, I donâ€™t know if you guys ever had this feeling, but do you remember when you were in elementary school, grammar school, and a kid in your class would come to school one day and youâ€™d find out their grandparent had died. And they would get, like, so much attention.
[laughter]
You know, the teacher would be like, â€œAaronâ€™s grandpa passed away,â€ and heâ€™d be likeâ€¦ [as a child] â€œThatâ€™s right.â€
[laughter]
And weâ€™d be like, â€œAw, Aaron.â€
And heâ€™d be, like, VIP for the day.
[laughter]
Heâ€™d be like, â€œCan I sit in the beanbag chair during reading time?â€ Weâ€™re like, â€œOf course, you poor fuck. You sit there.â€ [laughter] Forget the fact that thereâ€™s a laminated construction paper list of whose day it is to sit in the beanbag chair, and weâ€™ve all been patient waiting for our day. And letâ€™s even forget that the beanbag is there to teach us patience. You just jumped the line.
[laughter]
Did you ever look at how much attention that dead-grandparent kid was getting? And did you ever, like meâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦hope?
[laughter]
Or maybe evenâ€¦
[laughter builds]
â€¦pray.
[laughter and applause]
[scattered laughter]
â€œPlease kill one of my grandparents so I can get attention too.â€ I did. I did do that. And some of you did, too. And I know you did because you started laughing from the very beginning of the joke. [laughter] If you did, donâ€™t feel too bad, okay? Yes, itâ€™s a super dark memory. But you were a little kid. Also, you were a little kid, so you probably still had, like, four grandparents.
[laughter]
This is a lot of grandparents. Is this too many? Iâ€™mâ€¦ I amâ€¦ I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m asking. Look, God damn it! Iâ€™m not saying you pray to kill one of the important ones. [laughter] You donâ€™t want to kill your momâ€™s mom, too special of a relationship. And you donâ€™t want to kill your dadâ€™s dad because then your dad gets all weird.
[laughter]
Kids, you think your dadâ€™s weird now? Wait for his dad to die. Then he goes on a whole quest. Heâ€™ll wanna take more family pictures, but be angrier during them.
[laughter]
â€œCan we get one photo where we all look nice?â€ Weâ€™re like, â€œI donâ€™t think this motherfuckerâ€™s doing that well.â€
[laughter and applause]
[scattered cheering]
So you donâ€™t want to kill one of the important ones. [laughter] But you could killâ€¦ one of the unimportant ones. [laughter] You know who. [laughter] Youâ€¦ [laughter] You could kill your dadâ€™s mom. [laughter] Who even knew your dad had a mom? [laughter] It doesnâ€™t seem like she did a very good job.
[audience laughing hysterically]
Ask your mom if she thinks that your dadâ€™s mom did a good job and deserves to live. [laughter and applause] Of course not. She is an unpleasant older lady. Sheâ€™s never done nothing for no one. But she could now. [laughter] She could die, between September and May. Real talk, Boston. When I was in elementary school, my grandma died over the summer!
[laughter]
It was useless. You canâ€™t be walking into school on Labor Day, talking about â€œWe lost our Grandma July 17th.â€ â€œYou should be over it by now. Get out of the beanbag chair!â€ [laughter] Well, I apologize for beginning the show on such aâ€¦ dark note. But I didnâ€™t want to start way too upbeat, you know. Iâ€™ve had a weird couple years. Youâ€™ve had a weird couple years. I didnâ€™t wanna come out all phony, you know. Youâ€™re likeâ€¦ [mimics trumpet] â€œHey, Boston! Itâ€™s time to laugh!â€
â™ª Raise up your smiles â™ª â™ª Lower those masks â™ª â™ª You know what I mean â™ª â™ª We all quarantined â™ª â™ª We all went to rehab And we all got divorced â™ª â™ª And now our reputation is different â™ª
[audience laughing hysterically]
[cheering and applauding]
â™ª No one knows what to think â™ª â™ª Hey, yeah! â™ª â™ª All the kids like Bo Burnham more â™ª â™ª Because heâ€™s currently Less problematic â™ª â™ª Likability is a jail, ah â™ª
So we canâ€™t start that way.
[cheering and applauding]
All right, thanks. I wrote that song. Before I beginâ€¦ Uh, young man in the third row up there. Uh, whatâ€™s your name?
[boy] Henry.
Henry? Okay, Henry.
How old are we?
[Henry] Uh, 11.
Eleven. Okay, ha-ha, wonderful.
[laughter] You wonâ€™t at allâ€¦ [laughs] be distracting me throughout the entire performance. Henryâ€¦ Oh, man. Henry, do youâ€¦ I donâ€™t mean this in a like, â€œDo you know who I am?â€ kind of way, but like, do you know, like who I am, or did, like a babysitter cancel, and suddenly you were like, in a van? [laughter] You know who I am? Okay. Have you seen me do stand-up before? Okay. All right. Well, I appreciate you coming. So, umâ€¦
Soâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦the things that I talk aboutâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦tonight, that I did recentlyâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦I never say this, Henry. Itâ€™s notâ€¦ I donâ€™t say this explicitly, but donâ€™t. [laughter] All right?
[laughing and cheering]
Donâ€™t. Youâ€™re in the sixth grade? Fifth? [laughs] [laughter] All right. Well, Henry, if youâ€™ve seen me do stand-up before, I have kind of a different vibe now. [laughter] When I was a younger man, Iâ€™d come out on stage and be like, â€œHey!â€ [babbling rapidly] And I wonder what caused that. [laughter] Well, those days are over. [laughter] Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s over.
[cheering and applauding]
Okay.
[laughter]
Hereâ€™s what happened. [quirky music playing] [man scatting] December 18th, 2020. Henry, you were about to go on Christmas breakâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦from the third grade.
[laughter]
[Mulaney chuckles]
[man whoops]
I, meanwhile, was loose in New York City, not doing well. Feral. That night, December 18th 2020, I was invited over to my friendâ€™s apartment for dinner. Exciting, right? No. [laughter] When I got there, it was a trick. There was no dinner. It was an intervention. For me. [laughter] Interventions for me, are my least favorite kind of intervention. [laughter] When I walked into my intervention, I knew immediately that it was an intervention. Do you know how bad of a drug problem you have to have, if when you open a door, and see people gathered, your first and immediate thought is, â€œItâ€™s probably an intervention about my drug problemâ€? [laughter] â€œThereâ€™s no other reason people would be behind a door.â€ [laughter] This was my thought process, walking into my intervention that night. â€œGoing to dinner with a friend from college!â€ â€œGoing to dinner with a friend from college!â€ â€œGoing to dinner with a friend from college!â€ â€œWhatâ€™s Seth Meyers doing here?â€ â€œFuck!â€ [laughter] Also, I was two hours late for my intervention. [laughter] Well, I didnâ€™t know people were waiting on me. I wish I had. I would have been a million hours late. [laughter] I was two hours late, so when I got there, everyone was mad-der at me. [laughter] They were like, â€œAnd youâ€™re late.â€ I was like, â€œHey, if you wanted me here on time, you could have texted me, â€˜John, we have cocaine.'â€ [laughter] I would have been a half hour early to help set up chairs. I was two hours late, â€™cause I was running two very important errands. First errand, I went to my drug dealerâ€™s apartment. Iâ€™m ashamed to tell you all I was there to buy drugs. And I had to pay my dealer in cash, and I had to give him a bunch of cash for some drugs I bought a couple nights before because my Venmo was maxed out. Did you know? Did you know you can do that? You can max your Venmo out, on a weekly basis. By the way, while I have you all here, allow me to say something about Venmo on behalf of the drug addict community. [laughter] Venmo is for drug deals. Thatâ€™s what it was for. None of us in the drug world have any clue what all of you civiliansâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦are doing on our appâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦with your public fucking transactions.
[laughter and applause]
What are you, in ye olde marketplace, 1555? â€œHear ye! Hear ye!â€ â€œLook at me!â€ â€œI trade one fatted goose for ten radishes.â€ â€œKeep it to yourself.â€ The second errand I ran that night is very amusing to me. Dinner was scheduled for 7:00 p.m. So I went to get a haircutâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦at 7:00 p.m. [laughter] And I truly believed I could make both work. [laughter] I went to get this nighttime haircut at Saturday Night Live, which is a TV show, not an all-night pop-in barbershop. But they have a hair department there, right? And I still had my badge from when I worked there. So, at 7:00 p.m., coked out of my mind, I went up to the eighth floor of 30 Rockefeller Center, walked into the Emmy-Award-winning hair department, and I said, Hey, can I have a haircut? [laughter] And they said, â€œOh, John, youâ€™re not hosting this week.â€ And I said, â€œAh, hey, can I have a haircut?â€ [laughter] You know that thing of when a junkie walks into your office and asks for a haircut and youâ€™re like, â€œHurr, itâ€™d be faster to cut the hairâ€? Thatâ€™s what happened. I walk into my intervention two hours late. According to my friends, this is what I said. [in annoyed tone] â€œOkay!â€ [laughter] Iâ€™d just been to my drug dealerâ€™s apartment, so I immediately yelled out, â€œBefore we start, can I go to the bathroom?â€ [laughter] And they said no. And I saidâ€¦ [screams] Then this intervention lady that theyâ€™d hired runs up to me, and she goes, â€œHi.â€ And I said, â€œWrong energy!â€ [laughter] I walk into this intervention. Now, listen, everyone there at the intervention is really worried about me. Theyâ€™re all concerned about my physical well-being. But I stroll in there, I am cocaine-skinny, with a new haircut. [laughter] Theyâ€™ve all been in heavy quarantine for nine months. They looked like shit. [laughter] I was the best looking person at my intervention, by a mile.
[laughing and cheering]
Everyone there looked like Jerry Garcia. I walk in the room, thereâ€™s six of my friends sitting there in-person in New York. And six of my friends over Zoom, from LA. You may be thinking, â€œHey, if that was me, I would have been like, â€˜If youâ€™re so worried about me, how come you didnâ€™t fly in?'â€ Donâ€™t worry. I said that several times.
[laughter]
I said that multiple times throughout the night. The intervention lady goes, â€œHere, let me show you your chair.â€ I had a special chair. â€˜Cause I was belle of the ball. And Iâ€™m about to sit down in my chair, when a friend of mine in the corner goes, â€œI thought they were gonna tackle him.â€
[laughter]
â€œYou thought they were gonna what?â€ â€œYou know, like on Intervention.â€ â€œI thought they were gonna tackle you.â€ â€œThatâ€™s To Catch a Predator.â€ [laughter] â€œAre you disappointed now that theyâ€™re not gonna tackle me?â€ He went, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m a little disappointed.â€ I sit down in my chair, I face all these rats. [laughter] Look. Let me just call this out now, I donâ€™t mean to be weird. It was a star-studded intervention. [laughs] It was like a good group. It was a good group. As mad as I was when I walked in there, I was like, â€œThis is a good lineup. This is veryâ€¦â€ â€œThis is really flattering in its own way.â€ It was like a â€œWe Are the Worldâ€ of alternative comedians over the age of 40. All comedians. Yet no one said a funny thing the entire night. Before I got there, they promised each other that they wouldnâ€™t do bits. [laughter] I was going psychotic. I am sitting there in an awful chair, crashing from cocaine. No one will let me go to the bathroom to freshen up. [laughter] And the funniest people in the world are staring at me, refusing to do jokes! It was maddening! Fred Armisen was serious. [laughter] Do you know how off-putting that is? [laughter] He didnâ€™t do a character or a voice. He was just like, [as Fred Armisen] â€œHey, John, Iâ€™m really worried about everything that youâ€™re going through.â€ And I was like â€œAh! Next! Next!â€ [laughter] By the way, for most of this intervention, I was determined not to go to rehab. a.k.a., â€œLose.â€ [laughter] My plan was to destabilize the leader lady.
[laughter and applause]
If I could get the others to question her authorityâ€¦ [hysterical laughter] â€¦I thought the whole thing would fall apart like a house of cards. I was hoping, eventually, theyâ€™d be like, â€œI donâ€™t know, the haircut, the confidence, maybe we should make him the leader and send this lady to rehab.â€ At one point I was standing at an open window, chain smoking, in December in New York City. You know, the way a sober person would. And I looked at her and I said, â€œWere you even prepped for me?â€
[blows air]
[laughter]
And she said, â€œYes.â€ â€œBut everyone said you were very nice.â€ [laughter] Donâ€™t believe the persona. At one point, I threw this grenade at the gang. I go, â€œIâ€™ll go to rehab when all of you stop drinking and smoking weed.â€ [laughter] A hush fell over the intervention. And then Nick Kroll yelled, â€œJohnny, thatâ€™s not what this is about.â€ [laughter] Itâ€™s frustrating when people intervene on you, but they have problems of their own. Itâ€™s like when someone sends you a text but the text comes from their email address. [laughter] And youâ€™re like, â€œOkay, I understand the message, but you need to get your shit together. Thisâ€¦â€ â€œI hate this. Your name at iCloud.â€ â€œWhy are you texting me? Donâ€™t ever text me this way. Itâ€™s foolish.â€ Now we have two threads going. The original thread with your name saved the way I like it, and this new all lower case abomination. So many letters, it doesnâ€™t even fit in text preview. Then they keep texting you to see if itâ€™s still coming from their email, â€œHey, are my texts still coming from my email address?â€ â€œHuh. Weird.â€ â€œAre my texts still coming from my email?â€ â€œHuh. Weird.â€ They FaceTime you from their email address! [laughter] Are you calling on a childâ€™s iPad? [laughter] I was truly an asshole that night. I recognize that. But listen, I was furious at them. I was so mad that night. They had tricked me. I mean, at its core, an intervention is a prank. [laughter] They had pranked me, they were trying to tell me what to do with my life, they were trying to control me, they were sending me away to rehab for months. I felt powerless. I felt very angry. Now, standing here tonight, February 26th, 2023. One of the worst times of the year. [laughter] Here with all you wonderful people, and one of our top fifth graders. [laughter] Getting to do this show and standing hereâ€¦ Listen, I am grateful to everyone at my intervention. They intervened, they confronted me, and they totally saved my life.
[all cheering]
Okay. Thatâ€™s enough. Thatâ€™s enough. Donâ€™tâ€¦ Donâ€™t stand for them. Listenâ€¦ [laughter] Theyâ€™ve been thanked. [laughter] And like, theyâ€™re well aware they did a good thing. [laughter] They bring it up a lot. [laughter] Also, like, Iâ€™m still pissed off at them. Iâ€™m grateful. Iâ€™m truly grateful. And I wish I just felt that one emotion, but I donâ€™t. [laughter] I feel two emotions. [laughter] Iâ€™m still kind of mad. â€˜Causeâ€¦ Okay. Do you know what itâ€™s like for 12 people to save your life? Itâ€™s too many people. [laughter] They could have done it with four people. And I know the eight they could have cut.
[audience laughing hysterically]
Instead, for the rest of my life, there are 12 separate people out there who if Iâ€™m at dinner with them, I have to be like, â€œNo, I got that. Come on.â€ â€œHey, come on. For real.â€ â€œYou saved my life.â€ [laughter] â€œOver Zoom.â€
[laughter and applause]
[all cheering]
If anyone here has ever been to rehab, you probably know this, but you are not allowed to bring drugs in with you. [laughter] I donâ€™t know if you all recall my first errand of the evening before my intervention, but I leave that intervention for rehab, I have a lot of narcotics on me. So, back then I was addicted to cocaine, Adderall, Xanax, Klonopin, and Percocet. Called a Providence special.
[laughter and applause]
Providence, Rhode Island. For those of you around the world, thereâ€™s a city near here, and itâ€™s a big joke to all of us.
[laughter and applause]
Umâ€¦ Very silly place. I leave for rehab. I have on my person a full baggie of 30 mg Adderall, a full baggie of Xanax, 3 g of cocaine, and $2,000 in cash. I had other plans that weekend. [laughter] So I get to rehab at four oâ€™clock in the morning and I walk up to the intake desk. And at the intake desk, the woman says, â€œDo you have any drugs on you?â€ And I said, â€œNo, I do not.â€ â€œMay I please go to the bathroom?â€ Two guys grab me. They take my winter coat off me, they start going through the pockets. They go through the inside zipper pocket of my winter coat. I was like, â€œHow did they find out about the inside zipper pocket?â€ [laughter] â€œThat pocket has eluded everyone in my life.â€ They reach in there. They pull out all these pills and all this cash and 2 g of coke. Remember I said I had 3 g? Well, I did a bunch in the car. And I did a bunch at a gas station in the bathroom off of one of those Koala baby changing stations.
[audience groans]
What? Thatâ€™s what those are for. [laughter] You think youâ€™re supposed to put a human baby on that mouse trap of a device? [laughter] They have gang signs carved into them.
[audience groans]
Those are for snorting coke off of. When youâ€™re a cokehead, you see the world in terms of surfaces. [laughter] So they reach in. They pull out all these pills and all this cocaine and all this cash, and they stare at me. And I said, â€œOh, those old winter coats.â€
[laughter and applause]
You know that phenomenon. When youâ€™re going through your goose down jackets and youâ€™re like, â€œFive grand and an eight ball?â€ [laughter] â€œFrom the night we went caroling.â€ [laughter] â€œThose old winter coats.â€ Then they took my prescription drugs from me. My prescriptions. Not the illegal pills I bought on the street. The official prescriptions, with my name on them. And they took them from me simply because I had no business being prescribed them in the first place. [laughter] But, oh, the collection I had. All the effort, all the work that went into it. Do you know how hard it is to get a doctor to write you a prescription for a pill you donâ€™t need? [soft laughter] Itâ€™s not hard. [laughing] Itâ€™sâ€¦
[laughter and applause]
Itâ€™s so easy. Itâ€™s so easy. Hereâ€™s what you do, or hereâ€™s what I did, but donâ€™t do it. But if you did do it, it would totally work. Okay. [laughter] Umâ€¦ Go onâ€¦ Go on, like, WebMD. Search doctors in your zip code. Okay? And then sort the results. Lowest rating to highest. [laughter] You will not need to scroll far. [laughter] Find the doctor in your area with the lowest number of stars. This person needs your business. [laughter] Is this a bad doctor? Nay, nay. [laughter] This is the best doctor. [laughter] Dudeâ€¦ [laughter] You can walk in there and itâ€™s like Captain Phillips. You can be like, â€œLook at me, I am the doctor now.â€ [laughter] You can use their computer. [laughter] Check Yahoo! News or something. I had a doctor in New York City that just wrote me prescriptions. Dr. Michael. No last name. Oh, I donâ€™t mean Iâ€™m protecting his identity. He never told me his last name. [laughter] Even before the pandemic, Dr. Michael worked out of his apartment on Second Avenue. Thatâ€™s odd. [laughter] Iâ€™d go to see Dr. Michael, and Iâ€™d knock on his door, and heâ€™d always answer the door like this. Heâ€™d go, â€œMy wife, Minerva, is sleeping.â€ Like, really paranoid. But he wasnâ€™t saying, â€œSo keep your voice down.â€ It was as if he was saying, â€œI didnâ€™t just kill my wife Minerva.â€ [laughter] So then weâ€™d go into his kitchenette. To call it a kitchen would be a great exaggeration. And weâ€™d have our appointment. Iâ€™d go, â€œI want Klonopin.â€ And heâ€™d go, â€œOkay.â€ [laughter] And as he was writing it out on the pad and tearing it off, heâ€™d go, â€œOh, whatâ€™s it for?â€ And Iâ€™d go, â€œI have anxiety.â€ And heâ€™d go, â€œOh, then you need it.â€ [laughter] And then Dr. Michael, heâ€™d always go, â€œHey, you want a flu shot?â€ [chuckling] Awâ€¦ He wanted to be like a real doctor. [laughter] I go, â€œNo, Michael, you already gave me two flu shots this month, man.â€ â€œI feel crazy.â€ [laughter] â€œI feel super sick.â€ Then heâ€™d go, â€œDo you want a B12 Shot?â€ â€œYou want a vitamin shot?â€ So he always wanted to give me a shot of some kind, because he had, like, a thing. I mean, look, a guy named Dr. Michael that works out of his apartment is gonna have a thing. Michaelâ€™s thing was, he wanted guys to take their shirts off in his apartment.
[audience exclaims]
Youâ€™re all uncomfortable now, but Iâ€™m way over it. And also, if you think this story ends with me being like, â€œAnd I said, â€˜Absolutely not, â€˜â€ youâ€™re about to be so disappointed. [laughter] So we had this little, like, charade. Iâ€™d roll up my T-shirt sleeve and Michael would come in with the syringe, and heâ€™d go, â€œUm, Iâ€™m gonna need the whole shirt off.â€ [laughter] Iâ€™d be like, â€œThirty Klonopin, two refillsâ€¦â€ Wapow! [laughter] And then the sexual harassment would stop, to be fair. So maybe that was his whole thing. It was just getting guys to take their shirts off. Or maybe there was something about me with my shirt off that stops sexual harassment. [laughter] You know, that story has two morals. One, now you know that. [laughter] You didnâ€™t used to. The other moral is this. You should get vaccinated and get a booster and all of that. Butâ€¦ these days, when you hear people be like, â€œJust trust doctorsâ€¦â€ [laughs dryly] Anytime you hear someone say, â€œTrust doctors,â€ just remember, somewhere, in a kitchenetteâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦sits Dr. Michael. [laughter] And if heâ€™s so trustworthy, why is Minerva always sleeping? [laughter]
[cheering and applauding]
So they took my prescriptions. They take my prescriptions. Now this was all at four oâ€™clock in the morning when I first checked into rehab. Letâ€™s flash forward 12 hours now to 4:00 p.m. that same day. Iâ€™m in my hospital room, in the detox hospital at this rehab. I had to go to detox for like four or five days when I first got there â€™cause of everything in my system. Iâ€™m in my hospital room. Iâ€™ve been in rehab at this point for 12 hours. I have not gone to sleep during that time. And my total time awake to this point â€“ is 50 hours.
[audience exclaims]
Now, the doctors are trying to give me a bunch of medication to calm me down. But by this point in my life, my tolerance for sedatives was superhuman. No matter what they give me, they cannot subdue me. Iâ€™m like the great Rasputin, they cannot bring me to my knees.
[laughter]
Just then, a legitimately good doctor walks into my hospital room. If you have only been seeing Dr. Michael for the past few years, a good, legitimate doctor is terrifying. Itâ€™s like an exorcist. This guy walked in like, â€œHi, Iâ€™m Dr. Henry Ford Askew.â€ I was like, â€œNo. Two names.â€ [groaning] â€œNo.â€ Oh! Hey. [intoxicatedly] â€œYou want my shirt off, huh?â€ â€œYou like this?â€ â€œYou like stuff?â€ â€œWhat kind of a doctor are you, huh?â€ â€œIs your wife dead?â€ [shushing loudly] I scream at this doctor. I go, â€œWhereâ€™s my Klonopin?â€ â€œWe cannot give you your Klonopin.â€ â€œWhy not?â€ â€œWe are a rehab.â€
[laughter]
â€œI cannot give you a Schedule II narcotic under Pennsylvania state law.â€ And I said, â€œPennsylvania state law?â€ â€œWell, what if we go to a pharmacy in New Jersey?â€ [laughter] You see, I thought he was telling me about a predicament that we were both caught up in.
[laughter and applause]
Like, he was like, â€œLook, I would love to give you these pills.â€ â€œYou are clearly a super-chill young man, bobbing and weaving in a hospital gown and a pair of New Balance sneakers for the past 12 hours.â€ â€œBut this pesky state of Pennsylvania.â€ â€œOh-ho-ho, doctor, what if we go to a pharmacy in New Jersey?â€ â€œOh, my God, no one has ever thought of that.â€ â€œYouâ€™re the first drug addict here to have a scheme.â€
[laughter]
â€œLetâ€™s go in my car.â€ â€œYouâ€™re clearly ready to leave the grounds.â€ That was at 4:00 p.m. Three hours later, 7:00 p.m., I finally go to sleep. They give me enough of this drug called Librium, and I drop. They put a nurse in my hospital room to make sure I stay asleep â€™cause I had been trouble. Iâ€™m not sure what it was exactly that got them so worried. But it might have been when I said, â€œIâ€™m gonna pretend to go to sleep.â€ â€œAnd then when youâ€™re all like, â€˜Heâ€™s asleep, â€˜ and you leave my room, Iâ€™m gonna run the fuck out of this rehab.â€ Something about saying that out loud, twice, to two different staff members had raised a few eyebrows. So now Iâ€™m asleep, though. Iâ€™m legitimately out cold. They have a nurse in my room to make sure I stay asleep. Sheâ€™s sitting in a chair next to a bedside table. Iâ€™m asleep in the bed. My phone is face up on the bedside table next to her. Now, at this exact same time, about 7:00 p.m., my good friend Pete Davidson starts calling me.
Peteâ€¦
Yes, that one. Peteâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦was not at my intervention â€™cause he was traveling that night, but now heâ€™s landed, heâ€™s found out Iâ€™m in rehab, and heâ€™s concerned. So he starts calling. Fun fact about Pete. He changes his cellphone number constantly. I donâ€™t know why. Thatâ€™s his journey.
[laughter]
Every month and a half I get a text from Pete, saying, â€œYo, itâ€™s Pete. New number.â€ And I go, â€œSend a pic to prove it.â€ And he sends a photo like this. Then I save him in my phone. For a long time I just kept saving him again and again as Pete Davidson. At one point, I had nine Pete Davidsons saved in my phone. [in Italian accent] And thatâ€™s too many Pete Davidsons.
[in normal voice] Soâ€¦ I started to save him under fake famous peopleâ€™s names just to mix it up. Like, for a while he was saved in my phone as Rodney Dangerfield. The week I went to rehab, he was saved in my phone as Al Pacino.
[laughter]
So, Iâ€™m asleep in bed. A nurse is watching over me. My phone is next to the nurse. And Pete Davidson starts calling again and again and again. But what the nurse sees on the phoneâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦is that this unconscious patient is getting, not one, not two, but five missed calls from Oscar winnerâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦Al Pacino.
[laughter]
Soâ€¦ she fuckinâ€™ wakes me up.
[audience laughing hysterically]
[applauding]
I donâ€™t blame her. I wouldâ€™ve been so curious. She wakesâ€¦ I wake up and sheâ€™s shaking me going, â€œYouâ€™re getting a phone call.â€
[laughter]
I was so groggy, I was likeâ€¦ [grumbling] I roll over. Iâ€™m so exhausted. I look at the phone. I see that it says, â€œCall from Al Pacino.â€ I know that that means call from Pete Davidson. But I donâ€™t explain this complex code to the nurse. I just take the call in front of her. I go, â€œHello?â€ â€œOh, dog.â€
[laughter]
â€œIâ€™m not doing that well.â€ â€œOh, yeah, no oneâ€™s going to blame you.â€ Nowâ€¦
[audience continues laughing]
I said that last part because some people suggested that he and I did drugs together because he has tattoosâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦and I am plain.
[laughter]
We must be up to witchcraft. Iâ€™ve never done drugs with Pete. Heâ€™s always been very supportive of my sobriety. So thatâ€™s the conversation Iâ€™m having with Pete. But the conversation that the nurse thinks is happeningâ€¦
[laughter]
It delights me to this day.
[laughter]
â€œHelloâ€¦â€
[mimics Al Pacino] â€œJohnny!â€
[laughter] â€œItâ€™s Al.â€
[laughter]
â€œMy little boy blue.â€ [laughter] â€œI heard your ass is in rehab.â€ â€œHow you doing, dog?â€
[in normal voice] â€œOh, dog.â€
[laughter]
â€œIâ€™m not doing that well.â€
[mimics Al Pacino] â€œOh!â€ â€œMy little freckle juice.â€
[laughter]
â€œReason Iâ€™m calling you five timesâ€¦ I think Iâ€™m going to get blamed for this.â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™m getting suspicious that when the American public hears about the drug relapse of John Mulaney, they will logicallyâ€¦â€
[audience continues laughing]
â€œâ€¦and immediately nameâ€¦ only one culprit.â€
[laughter]
â€œAnd that is myself!â€ â€œSeventy-nine year oldâ€¦â€
[laughter and applause]
â€œâ€¦Oscar winner, Al Pacino!â€ â€œPacino from the Italian.â€ â€œâ€˜Paâ€™ meaning Daddy, and â€˜Chino, â€˜ meaning khaki pants.â€
[laughter]
â€œTheyâ€™re going to blame Daddy khaki pants.â€
[laughter]
[scattered laughter]
â€œThis line has been compromised.â€ [laughter] I was in rehab for two months from December 18th to February 20th. I was there January 6th during the insurrection. Wouldnâ€™t have happened on my watch. [laughter] â€˜Cause I would have made sure. I would have made sure it didnâ€™t.
[cheering]
Was there ever an insurrection before I went to rehab? No. Has there been one since I got out? Absolutely not. They wouldnâ€™t dare. They know Baby J is back on the streets.
[cheering and applauding]
The whole time I was in rehab, it was very locked down for COVID. So we never got to leave the building. But Iâ€™ve heard at some rehabs, they take you on field trips. Like the one I was at, I guess in better times, you got to go to a farm and meet a horse. They do it a lot. Itâ€™s called equine therapy. That sounds really nice, but how bad do you feel for that horse? Itâ€™s born being like, â€œOne day Iâ€™m going to win the Kentucky Derby.â€ [chuckles] And its whole life itâ€™s just junkies being like, [mimics junkies] â€œOkay.â€
[laughter]
â€œAll right.â€ â€œPetting your strong leg gives me confidence.â€ [laughter] â€œIf I can lift your hoof, it means Iâ€™m ready to have my own apartment.â€ [laughter] When I first got to rehab, one of my biggest fears, was that everyone was going to recognize me. Graduallyâ€¦ [faint laughter] â€¦a new fear took over.
[audience laughing hysterically]
Iâ€™m notâ€¦ Iâ€™m not, like exaggerating to be funny. Fucking no oneâ€¦ [laughs]
[laughter and applause]
No one knew who I was.
[audience whistling]
And it was driving me bananas. [laughter] Please donâ€™t repeat this. It was in the newspaper that I was in rehab and I left it out.
[chuckles]
[laughter]
I was like, [high-pitched] â€œOh, my God, the paperâ€™s here.â€ â€œGet in here, you addicts. Oh, my God!â€ â€œLetâ€™sâ€¦ Oh, I wonder whatâ€™s inside.â€ [laughter] Before I realized that no one knew who I was, I went to this Welcome Group. So, like, I went from the detox ward to the menâ€™s ward where I was gonna live for a few months. When I got there, they had a Welcome Group. And before I walked into the group, I said to myself, I was like, â€œBe modest.â€ [laughs]
[laughter]
So, I go in and I sit down and I go, â€œHi, Iâ€™m John M.â€ [laughter] And theyâ€™re all staring at me like, why are you holding for applause? [laughter] And this one guy, Lenny, who I later became really good friends with. He goes, â€œWhat do you do for a living?â€ The other guys go, â€œWhat do you do for a living?â€ And I was like, ah. And I go, â€œIâ€™m a stand-up comedian.â€ And Lenny goes, â€œYou make a living that way?â€ [laughter] Like, â€œYeah, ask your daughter.â€
[laughter and applause]
â€œOr your son if heâ€™s not an athlete.â€
[laughter and applause]
Ask only certain sons. [laughter] I got in trouble my second week in rehab. â€˜Cause I ordered Outback steakhouse using Postmates. [laughter] There were two things in this Pennsylvania town where I went to rehab. There was an Outback and there was a rehab. But when I ordered the Outback, I somehow thought the delivery guy wouldnâ€™t know what the rehab was. So I gave him the street address of the rehab as if it was my home. [chuckles] And then in the special instructions I wrote, â€œDonâ€™t stop at the big building.â€
[laughter]
â€œDrive up the hill to the brick dorm and youâ€™ll see a 38-year-old man outside in a robe whoâ€™s so excited.â€
[laughter]
So the food arrives, but it gets confiscated by the RS on duty. He calls me into his office and he goes, [angrily] â€œThis is fucked up. This is serious.â€ I go, â€œItâ€™s just Outback.â€ He goes, â€œWhat if itâ€™s an Outback dry run?â€ I go, â€œWhatâ€™s an Outback dry run?â€ He goes, â€œWell this time you order Outback and itâ€™s just food, and we laugh it off and we let it through.â€ â€œBut what if you left a really big tip, so that next time you order, you go, â€˜Hey, remember me?'â€ â€œâ€˜I left you a really big tip. â€˜Iâ€™ll give you an even bigger tip if you get me some drugs.'â€ I said, â€œOh, my God, that is a fantastic idea.â€
[laughter]
[man whistling] I worked hard in rehab. I did what my counselors told me. When I first got there, my counselor asked me to write an autobiography of my substance use and abuse. I said, â€œWhat do you mean?â€ He goes, â€œWrite all the big life points where you use drugs and alcohol.â€ I said, â€œYou mean recently or starting at age six?â€ He said, â€œYou started drinking then?â€ I said, â€œYes.â€ And then he gave me more paper.
[laughter]
I tried alcohol when I was six. I donâ€™t mean I was at a bar, having a Manhattan or something. We were allowed to try beer and wine. My dad told us when we were kids, â€œWe have a European approach towards alcohol in this house.â€ That was the only thing we had a European approach towards. Everything else we had a very Midwestern approach. Including Europe. Weâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™re not going there.â€
[laughter]
By the time I was 13, I got drunk every weekend. My friends and I would go out on the streets of Chicago, on Lincoln Avenue, and weâ€™d stand in front of liquor stores and try to get adults to go in and buy liquor for us. This was always a very dramatic process â€“ â€™cause we were thirteen, we looked nine.
[faint laughter]
Weâ€™d be sitting out there like little Charles Dickensâ€™ urchins. Just like, â€œSir, please. Sir, Sir, please.â€ Theyâ€™d sometimes try to give me money, Iâ€™d go, â€œNo, I give you money.â€ â€œAnd you buy me beer in this store, the one where the cashier is watching â€“ this entire exchange through the window.â€
[laughter]
In 8th grade once I said to my friends, I go, â€œWe should only ask couples on dates â€™cause the guy will want to buy beer for us to look cool in front of the girl.â€
[scattered laughter and clapping]
I did not understand adult first date dynamics. [chuckles] As if when heâ€™s dropping her off, sheâ€™d be like, [mimics woman] â€œYou knowâ€¦â€
[laughter]
â€œâ€¦I wasnâ€™t sure about you in the beginning of the night, butâ€¦ when I saw you buy those two 24 packs of Natty Light, using quarters and dimesâ€¦â€
[laughter]
â€œâ€¦and that one bottle of Booneâ€™s Farm for that really specific childâ€¦â€
[scattered applause]
â€œâ€¦I was like, this guy might be a keeper.â€ [laughter] I started doing drugs when I was 14 with my two best friends, John and John. Theyâ€™re not me. Theyâ€™re other people.
[laughter]
They were both named John. There was John Oâ€™Brien, John McNulty, and then me. My name is John Mulaney. And if you didnâ€™t know that, you were probably in rehab with me.
[laughter]
One timeâ€¦ [chuckles] One time when we were 16, me, John and John, we were in a parking lot at night and we were smoking a joint. Weâ€™re getting high. And a police car pulled in out of nowhere likeâ€¦ We went, â€œShit.â€ And we threw the joint we had down a sewer and we got rid of all of our weed. But they still called us over and made us put our hands on the patrol car. â€œLine up and put your hands on the hood.â€ So the three of us line up and we put our hands on the patrol car. The police officer walks up to John Oâ€™Brien first and he starts to give him a pat down. He goes, â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€ He goes, â€œJohn.â€
[laughter]
Then he goes to John McNulty. [chuckles] Starts to give him a pat down. He goes, â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€ He goes, â€œJohn.â€
[laughter]
Then he got to me. Before he gave me a pat down, he leaned in and whispered in my ear, â€œYour name better fucking not be John.â€
[laughter and applause]
â€œThey call me Baby J out on these streets.â€
[cheering and applauding]
One thing you do in rehab, you sit down with your counselor and you go through your phone. And a lot of times theyâ€™ll have you delete and block any drug dealers or any bad influences numbers that you have. In some cases, you reach out to the people first and you tell them, â€œHey, Iâ€™m going to delete and block you.â€ So that they donâ€™t try to track you down later. Itâ€™s called breaking up with your dealer. So I did this one day. I sat with my counselor, I go through my phone. I went to my main dealer Arvin, first. And I texted him and I said, â€œHey, Iâ€™m deleting and blocking you.â€ â€œIâ€™m never going to buy drugs from you again.â€ â€œIâ€™m sober now.â€ Then I didnâ€™t know how to end the text. So I go, â€œBut thank you forâ€¦ [laughs] your many years of inspired professionalism, and the many nights that became days.â€ I send the text. Before I can delete and block him, Arvin texts me back. He goes, â€œHey, Iâ€™m so proud of you for getting sober.â€ Then he writes, â€œYou know, I only bought drugs to sell to you â€™cause I was worried about you and I didnâ€™t want you to get worse stuff off the street.â€
[laughter]
I know. And Iâ€™m breaking up with this guy? [laughter] So Iâ€¦ I canâ€™t delete him now. I text him back. I go, â€œYou sweet man.â€
[laughter]
I saidâ€¦ I said, â€œYou only bought drugs to sell to me?â€ He says, â€œYeah.â€ I say, â€œDid you sell drugs to other people?â€ He says, â€œNo.â€
[soft laughter]
Then I say, â€œHey, this is a weird time to ask, but are you a drug dealer?â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œNo, Iâ€™m a painter, we talked about this.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
Boston, to this day, I have no idea how I know this person. [laughter] So I text him back. And I say, â€œHow did it come to beâ€¦â€ [laughter] â€œâ€¦that you sell me drugs?â€ And he wrote back, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ â€œYou just kept asking.â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
I like that story â€™cause there are many tales of drug dealers who have turned innocent people into drug addicts. [laughter] I might be the first drug addict to turn an innocent man into a drug dealer.
[all applauding]
And that is the promise of J.
[cheering and whistling]
In rehab, we would sit around in group a lot. And we would sit around and share stories of the most desperate things we did to get drugs. And I would like to share one of those with you now. So a little context for this story. Uh, in January of 2020, Iâ€™m very addicted to cocaine. I want to stop. Uh, so rather than talk to a drug counselor, or any type of counselor or a therapist or a doctor or literally anyone in my life, I call my accountant. And I go, â€œHey, Iâ€™m addicted to coke.â€ â€œYou need to stop giving me money.â€ â€œDonâ€™t give me any cash.â€ He goes, â€œGod, this is not what I signed up for.â€
[laughter]
I go, â€œThe only way you can give me cash is if I email you and CC my doctor.â€ â€œThatâ€™s the new rule.â€ I hang up the phone. Iâ€™m immediately mad about the rule. [laughter] Iâ€™m like, â€œItâ€™s my money.â€ â€œSon of a bitch wants me to email him with my doctor?â€ So rather than pick up the phone and call him back and say, â€œHey, thatâ€™s not a rule anymore.â€ Which I could totally do because Iâ€™m a grown man and he works for me. Instead, I spend the next six months finding elaborate ways to steal my own money from myself.
[laughter]
In August of 2020, I was very strung out. I desperately wanted cocaine. And I realized I still had a credit card that worked. And I decided I was going to buy a Rolex watch with my credit card and pawn it for cash five minutes later. Iâ€™m pretty good at reading a room. Youâ€™re all very impressed by this plan.
[laughter]
So, one day in August of 2020, when it is 100 degrees Fahrenheit outside, I walk in to the Rolex store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. I walk in. All the guys in there are in suits. And theyâ€™re going like, â€œHmm, watchesâ€¦ Switzerlandâ€¦â€ They move like animatronics. I walk in there. Iâ€™m wearing very light jeans, cuffed twice at the ankle, white Reebok sneakers, white socks, a very long white T-shirt, a white baseball cap. I am chewing Nicorette gum. I have a JanSport backpack hiked up as high as it can possibly go. I am 38 years old.
[audience laughing hysterically]
I walk into the store and I walked up to the first display case I saw, and I went, â€œThat one. Hi!â€ â€œThat one. I loved that watch.â€ â€œI want that watch, please.â€ The salesmen turns around. He has a handkerchief already like heâ€™s a magician. He goes, â€œAh!â€ â€œI see youâ€™re looking at the rose gold watch.â€ â€œWould you like to see any other time pieces?â€ I go, â€œNo, no, Iâ€™m not interested in timepieces.â€ â€œJust watches. Thatâ€™s the one I want.â€ â€œI researched it.â€ â€œI know everything about it. Give me the watch, please.â€ He opens the display case, he takes the watch out. Itâ€™s on its own little, like, suede bed, you know. He goes, â€œShall we try it on your wrist?â€ I go, â€œNo time. No need.â€ â€œItâ€™s not for me.â€ â€œItâ€™s a gift for my brother, and I know his wrist so well.â€ â€œWhen youâ€™re brothers, you look over.â€ â€œWe shared a room, Iâ€™d see his wrists, so I know itâ€™s going to be perfect.â€ He goes, â€œAh! A gift for your brother.â€ â€œAnd tell me, what rings does your brother wear?â€ I goâ€¦ â€œWhat?â€
[laughter]
â€œIs this some kind of a riddle?â€ [laughter] â€œIs this the initiation to some Yale White People Society?â€
[laughter]
â€œWhat do you mean, what kind of rings does my brother wear?â€ He goes, â€œWellâ€¦ uh, if your brother wears rings of yellow or white gold, you may not want a rose gold watch.â€ â€œAs you may know, you should never mix metals.â€ I go, â€œFirst off, Iâ€™m insulted you only think I might know that.â€ [laughter] â€œI definitely know that as well as all other facts.â€ [laughter] â€œI never mixâ€¦â€ â€œI wouldnâ€™t put, uh, an aluminum can next to a teakettle.â€
[laughter]
â€œI wouldnâ€™t put a trumpet on a radiator.â€ â€œIâ€¦ Call me old fashioned but I believe in this strict segregation.â€ â€œYou heard me. Segregation of metals within the home.â€ â€œSecondly, my brother has no rings and he never will.â€ â€œHe never will. My brother, oh, he has no fingers.â€
â€œHe has a stump.â€
[laughter]
â€œThatâ€¦ He has a stump of a hand.â€ â€œThatâ€™s what the watch is for. Donâ€™t you see?â€ â€œThe watch will adorn the stump, so that when he looks down at this foul thing, he will see the beautiful watch.â€ â€œAnd he will think only of the generosity of his little brother and not the horrible Vitamix accident that claimed his digits.â€ â€œSell me the watch, please.â€
[laughter and applause]
The guy takes out a green Rolex box and he opens it, puts the watch in. Thereâ€™s a little cardboard card in the box. He takes out a fountain pen and heâ€™s writing on the cardâ€¦ for what I thought was too long. I was like, â€œJesus Christ, is he writing a letter to the watch?â€ â€œHe knows Iâ€™m going to pawn it, wants it to have a letter to know where it came from.â€ â€œEveryone in this store knows Iâ€™m about to pawn this watch.â€ â€œThey think Iâ€™m dirt, but Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m God.â€ Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going through my head. The guy takes out a ribbon and I go, [aggressively] â€œNo. No gift wrap.â€ He goes, [calmly] â€œI thought you said this was a gift.â€ I go, â€œNo. But my brother and I, weâ€™re not like that.â€ â€œWeâ€™re not fancy. Iâ€™m going to run past his house.â€ â€œIâ€™m going to throw the watch in the air.â€ â€œHeâ€™s going to catch it on his stump.â€ â€œI canâ€™t show up with some big elaborate ribbon.â€ â€œAnd how would my brother even untie that? I confided in you.â€ â€œI confided in you about his condition and now youâ€™re giving me all this.â€ â€œWhat do you expect him to do? Pull it apart with his teeth?â€ â€œSell me the watch for cocaine.â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
[applause, whistling]
He takes my credit card. He runs it. He gives me my card back. He takes out a Rolex shopping bag. I immediately spin my JanSport backpack around, opened and unzipped. And I go, â€œNo need.â€
[laughter]
He puts the watch box in my backpack. I zip it up. Before Iâ€™m even out the door of the store, I take out my phone and I google, â€˜Where sell watch right now in New York City.â€™ A place called â€˜Sell your watch right now NYCâ€™ comes up. I was like, â€œFinally, someone in this town gets me.â€
[laughter]
I call the place and I go, â€œHello. Um, yes, I have a Rolex watch to sell.â€ â€œMay I come in today?â€ The guy goes, â€œYes, yes. What time do you want to come in?â€ I go, â€œI am two minutes away and I am sprinting towards your store.â€ â€œI will be there in one minute.â€ And he goes, â€œOkay, Iâ€™m across the street at lunch.â€ â€œIâ€™ll start running too.â€ [chuckling] So now he and I are both running down 47th Street. My backpack is flying back and forth to either side like an old ladyâ€™s big bosoms when she jumps up and down on the showcase showdown.
[laughter]
We get to his business. Itâ€™s above one of those big Diamond Martz, but his office is upstairs. so we go upstairs. He buzzes me in through two bulletproof glass doors. Youâ€™ve seen Uncut Gems. We go into his office and we sit down, and now I have to change gears. Because, yes, Iâ€™ve been frenzied all morning, but Iâ€™m now selling the watch. I canâ€™t act desperate to sell it. I need to get the right price. So I have to play it very cool. So I slowly removed my backpack, revealing a perfect outline of sweat on the straps and back. He offers me water, which I immediately refuse. Despite the fact that my lips are sticking to my teeth.
[laughter]
I say, â€œHello. I have a beautiful watch to sell.â€ â€œIâ€™m in no hurry to sell it.â€ â€œIâ€™ve had it for many years.â€ â€œIâ€™ve never worn it either, so itâ€™s in perfect condition.â€ He goes, â€œYouâ€™ve had this watch for many years?â€ I go, â€œThat is correct.â€ He goes, â€œWhy donâ€™t you wear it then?â€ I said, â€œOh, I would love to wear this watch.â€ â€œBut you see, I wear ringsâ€¦â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
â€œâ€¦of yellow gold, and silver gold.â€
[laughter]
â€œAnd as we both knowâ€¦â€
[laughter]
â€œâ€¦you must never mush metals.â€
[woman in audience] â€œMush metals.â€
The guy opens the Rolex watch box he looks in, he looks at the little card that the guy was writing with a fountain pen on. He looks at the card. He looks at me. He looks at the card. He goes, â€œYouâ€™ve had this watch for many years?â€ I go, â€œUh-huh.â€ He goes, â€œThis is todayâ€™s date.â€ [laughter] And I said, â€œThatâ€™s right.â€
[laughter]
And I stared at himâ€¦ with all the charm and charisma left in my drug-addled body, hoping I could somehow bend logic to make both things be true at once. I have had this watch for many years. And that is todayâ€™s date.
[laughter]
At this point, he realizes he has the upper hand in this negotiation. [laughter] I bought the watch for $12,000. Before you all flip outâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦please remember, watches depreciateâ€¦ within seconds of leaving the store. I bought the watch for $12,000. He goes, â€œ$5000.â€ I go. â€œNo.â€
He goes, â€œ$6000.â€ I go, â€œYes.â€
[laughter]
I feel your judgment. You must think Iâ€™m pretty stupid. Well, let me ask you this. Why donâ€™t you name a better wayâ€¦ to make $6000â€¦ in five minutesâ€¦ [laughter] by only spendingâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦$12,000?
[laughter and applause]
Andâ€¦ as you process and digest how obnoxious, wasteful and unlikable that story is, just remember, thatâ€™s one Iâ€™m willing to tell you.
[laughter]
[cheering and applauding]
Itâ€™s weird to be a recovering drug addict. It was weird to be a drug addict, but at least I was on drugs. [laughter] Itâ€™s strange sometimes, you know, like Iâ€™m doing great. But when Iâ€™m alone, Iâ€™m with the person that tried to kill me. Sometimes I walk past a mirror, Iâ€™m like, â€œThis fucking guy again.â€ â€œJesus.â€ That is kind of a creepy feeling sometimes. But itâ€™s also a nice feeling. It gives me a strange kind of confidence sometimes, because, like, look, Iâ€¦ I used to care what everyone thought about meâ€¦ so much. It was all I cared about. All I cared about was what other people thought of me. And I donâ€™t anymore. And I donâ€™t because I can honestly say, what is someone going to do to me thatâ€™s worse than what I would do to myself. What, are you going to cancel John Mulaney? Iâ€™ll kill him.
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
I almost did. [woman cackling] I was in a museum in Detroit with my son. I was pushing him in a stroller through this big room where they have all these Diego Rivera murals. And I was explaining to my son, Malcolm. He was about nine months at the time. Diego Rivera was brilliant but a communist. [laughter] And Malcolm was just blowing kisses to inanimate objects and crossing his eyes as he shit his diaper.
[laughter]
And Iâ€™d never been out with him and had to change a diaper alone in public before. So I went up to the museum docent, and I said, â€œIs there anywhere I can change my baby?â€ And she goes, â€œYeah, the menâ€™s room would be fine.â€ I go, â€œOkay.â€ And I push him in the menâ€™s room. And I walk in there and I look on the wall.
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
â€œHello, old friend.â€
[laughing and cheering]
My life is in a much, much better place now. Butâ€¦ if I ever feel that I need a reminderâ€¦ Thank you very much. â€¦of just how bad things used to be. I luckily, have this This is an interview that I gave to GQ magazine, that I have absolutely no memory of giving. [laughter] Have you ever had a conversation on drugs that you donâ€™t remember the next day?
Was it a very long interview?
[laughter]
I gave this interview December 15th, 2020. My intervention was December 18th. [faint laughter] So itâ€™s bad that it was before. I guess what happened was a reporter called me and he said, â€œHey, Iâ€™d like to interview you.â€ I was on a lot of cocaine, and I donâ€™t know if you know how cocaine works, but that is great news.
[laughter]
So I want to share a few highlights from this interview that I have no memory of giving. Beginning with a line in their introduction, which says, â€œGQ hopped on the phone with the comedian, for a wide ranging conversation.â€
[laughter]
First question. â€œGQ: What are you up to today?â€
â€œMulaney: I walked past what is supposedly the most haunted building in New York City.â€
[laughter]
â€œGQ: Oh!â€
[laughter]
â€œWhere is that?â€
â€œMulaney: Itâ€™s a vacuum cleaner store, and itâ€™s on 14th between 5th and 6th, and it used to be a boarding house.â€
â€œMy, oh my, apparently just incredibly haunted, and Iâ€™m talking like Poltergeist haunted.â€
[laughter]
â€œGQ: Okay.â€
[laughter]
â€œDid you get a chill or a bad vibe?â€
â€œMulaney: It doesnâ€™t give me a bad vibe anymore.â€
â€œI think when I first walked past it, I knew what it was.â€
â€œSo maybe I faked the bad vibes.â€
What?
[laughter]
What could he mean? By the way, they have editors. They could have helped me out.
[laughter]
â€œI think when I first walked past it, I knew what it was.â€
â€œSo maybe I faked the bad vibes.â€
â€œAlthough I walked by a house that was haunted in Los Angeles once, I didnâ€™t know it was haunted.â€
â€œI was just kind of like, â€˜Oh, whatâ€™s this house?â€™ â€œ
â€œAnd then slowly, I was like, â€˜Nah, I donâ€™t like this house.â€™ â€œ
â€ â€˜Iâ€™m going to walk away from here with my dog.â€™ â€œ
â€œAnd then I found out it was called the murder house of Los Feliz.â€
â€œAnd then I found out that it had a terrible history.â€
â€œYes, thatâ€™s the only time that Iâ€™ve really had a creeping sense of ghouls and ghosts out of nowhere, and then have it to be proven totally correct.â€
[laughter]
[cheering and applauding]
No. There was not another question asked in the midst of that run, I am still answering the question, â€œWhat did you do today?â€
[laughter]
Also, I goddamn love that I used the word â€œghouls.â€
[laughter]
When do you get to say that? Next question.
â€œGQ: I want to talk to you about how this year has been for you creatively because around this time last year, you were coming off of the Sack Lunch Bunch, which was arguably one of your biggest creative risks, and it really paid off.â€
â€œHow has your creative process been impacted by this year?â€
â€œMulaney: [excitedly] If you heard that spoon drop, itâ€™s â€™cause Iâ€™m eating a bowl of fruit loops.â€
[audience laughing hysterically]
[scattered applause]
Phenomenal. Phenomenal answerâ€¦ to any question in life. Always call out and identify every noise in a room. It doesnâ€™t come off paranoidâ€¦ at all.
Next question. â€œGQ Magazine: Watching you on late night with Seth Meyers made me wonder, would you ever want your own talk show?â€
â€œMulaney: Okay. Soâ€¦â€ [cheerfully] â€œI had two ideas for a talk show once.â€ [in normal voice] Letâ€™s pause and appreciate that sentence for a sec. â€œI had two ideas for a talk show once.â€ [high-pitched] â€œAnd by ideas, I mean, I thought about them in the privacy of my own room.â€
[laughter]
â€œOne idea would be just interviewing people who do anything that interests me.â€ â€œAnd I donâ€™t mean like Iâ€™m on the ground and Iâ€™m watching them do their job.â€ â€œNo, it would be like a talk show set.â€ â€œAnd theyâ€™d come out there. And thereâ€™d be a band and so forth.â€ [in normal voice] Okay, letâ€™s pause right here. So, just to recap. I had two ideasâ€¦ for a talk show once. And the first of these is a talk show. [laughter] [excitedly] â€œThe other idea was to have a show and just have on only elderly people.â€ [laughter] â€œWhich I obviously would not do now due to the risks.â€
[laughter]
[cheering]
[whistling] [chuckling] â€œBut I just thought it would be great to talk to old people, especially if they were comfortable talking about being at the end of their lives.â€
[laughter]
Next question. â€œGQ: Speaking of television, [chuckles] you had that sitcom that didnâ€™t pan out, but that was such a long time ago.â€ â€œWeâ€™re in an era where networks and all these different streaming services are giving creators seemingly more room to make the shows that they want.â€ â€œGiven that, would you try it again?â€
â€œMulaney: Are you talking about a multi-cam, live audience sitcom, The way I did it?â€
â€œGQ: No.â€
[laughter]
[chuckles] â€œNot necessarily.â€
â€œMulaney: I would do the exact same show I did before, and the only thing I would change is the audience.â€
[hysterical laughter]
[applauding and cheering]
And hereâ€™s how it wraps up. â€œGQ: I think what weâ€™ve established in this conversation is that there are a ton of different ideas rattling around in your head that you should definitely make happen.â€
â€œMulaney: If thatâ€™s what people take away from this, Iâ€™d be thrilled.â€ [laughter]
â€œGQ: Okay.â€ [soft laughter] â€œIâ€™m going to let you go.â€ â€œI donâ€™t want to take too much of your time away from the fruit loops.â€
[laughter]
[high-pitched] â€œMulaney: What are you talking about?â€
[laughter and applause]
[laughs boisterously]
â€œTheyâ€™re long gone.â€ Good night, Boston. Thank you very, very much.
[cheering and applauding]
[slow-tempo bass music playing]

[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
[CROWD CHEERING]
Wow. Hello, hello, hello, everybody. Wow. Thank you so much. Yeah, itâ€™s so fun to be back in Denver. Iâ€™ve been coming here for 150,000 years and Iâ€™m never bored. Thereâ€™s always something to do and that is not the case every week on the road. No. Just not long ago, I was in this tiny town in Georgia, me and my friend Vic, and we were looking for something to do and we kept asking the local people. Heâ€™s like, â€œWe got eight hours off is there anything fun to do?â€ And they justâ€¦ all of them responded with, â€œWell, you can zip line to another state for $55.â€ And I asked the one guy, just â€™cause I wanted to see if he would know, I go, â€œWhat state would I end up in if I chose to do it?â€ And he literally answered me with a question. He goes, â€œAlabama?â€ Yes. That is the state on the other side of you, Jesus, even I know that and I donâ€™t even live here. And I think thatâ€™s what you should do with your criminals in Georgia. You should zip line them in the middle of the night to Alabama. You give him an iPhone and $100 and say, â€œLook, if we see your ass again in Georgia, pow, pow, bang, bang. No jokey-jokey.â€
We were so bored. So he goes, â€œWell, letâ€™s just go take a walk. Thereâ€™s a creek over there.â€ So we took a walk and some lady pulled up with a red truck. I donâ€™t know her. He doesnâ€™t know her. She rolled out her window and she goes, â€œHey, are yâ€™all walking on purpose?â€ Wow. Iâ€™ve never been asked that in my whole life. I go, â€œYeah, weâ€™re walking on purpose.â€ She goes, â€œWhy?â€ I said, â€œâ€˜Cause we donâ€™t want a zip line to Alabama.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Do you guys have saved your ticket? Like, this has been rescheduled because of COVID and I felt so bad during COVID, â€™cause like I have relatives that are teachers and nurses and they all had to work so, so hard and it was all crazy. And as a comedian, I was told by the government to stay home and watch TV andâ€¦ I nailed it. Iâ€™m just saying, Iâ€™m kind of an American hero. So, I followed my instructions. I watched stuff that I didnâ€™t even know really while I wasâ€¦ why I was watching it, while I was watching them, Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, last I checked, I have a year off, so, Iâ€™ll finish it. Who cares?â€
I watched an hour-long special about Caitlyn Jenner, and I said to my sister, like, I donâ€™t know, halfway through, and I go, â€œI have no idea what itâ€™s like to want to transition, but the desire must be super powerful because she, Caitlyn, is in her 60s and had to go through all these surgeries and all this craziness to become a woman in her 60s.â€ Iâ€™m in my 50s and I donâ€™t wanna go to LensCrafters, likeâ€¦ I wonâ€™t do it anymore. Like these contacts will rot my eyes, or I will drag my ass back down to that mall and have a millennial shoot air in my eyeâ€¦ that I didnâ€™t ask for. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Stop doing that. Stop doing that. â€œWe have to test for glaucoma.â€ â€œNo, you donâ€™t. No, you donâ€™t. Iâ€™ll give you some 70 bucks and sign a waiver. Weâ€™ll call it even.â€ [BLOWS RASPBERRY] â€œOh, your eyes are closed again.â€ Yeah. Thatâ€™s what happens when you shoot an F5 tornado into some of these eyeballs. Thatâ€™s the natural reaction. Thatâ€™s why Jesus gave us eyelids. Thatâ€™s why we have those.
God. A year off. I mean, people fantasize about that, right? Weâ€™ve all had those conversation. â€œWhat if you had a whole year of your life, like, what would you do? Would you, like, write a novel or, like, you know, learn pottery or, like, build a cabin?â€ [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Nope. Turns out nothing. I did nothing. I am no different unemployed than I am employed. Thereâ€™s just more of it. Well, â€œYeah, I will have a Bloody Mary right now. I donâ€™t have to be at work or another 385 days. Yeah, go ahead. Make it a double.â€
Who cares? It really proved the nuns right of my grade school career, because in a Catholic school, they always took that opportunity on a report card to write something snide on the back, and they would always write. â€œKathleen does not make productive use of her free time.â€ Like to shout-out to Sister Sheila, you nailed it. You did.
You are still right. I did not make productive use of that timeâ€¦ a year. I thought about learning stuff, like I thought about learning Spanish, but then Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah,â€ but theyâ€™re doing so good at English. Like, Iâ€™ll never catch up to them. Like, Iâ€™ll be dumb in two languages and thereâ€™s no reason to put yourself through that.
I did teach myself how to gamble via phone. That was pretty exciting. Yeah. DraftKings, BetMGM, FanDuel, all of them. But hereâ€™s a little warning, if you have an addictive personality, just a little recommendation, I would turn the notifications off because that is a hundred percent the devilâ€™s doorbell, okay? Every five seconds, â€œBing. Hey, Kathleen. Thereâ€™s a cricket match starting in Mumbai in four and a half minutes. Do you wanna get a bet in?â€ â€œYes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.â€ I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t even know how to play cricket, but thereâ€™s only two teams. I got a 50/50 chance right out of the gate. Set it down, literally four minutes later, â€œBing. Hey, Kathleen, thereâ€™s a womenâ€™s tennis tournament starting in Eastern Europe. Would you like to bet on individual players?â€ â€œYes. Any lady that ends it â€˜ova, â€˜ I want $50 on all the â€˜ova, â€˜ surely one more win.â€ And then Iâ€™ll cover that bet.
The only thing I did learn, which was alarming, is that Iâ€™ve been washing my hands wrong for 56 years. Yeah. Sanjay Gupta, the Buzzkill. He was on some show and he said, â€œIn order to wash your hands properly, you have to wash your hands for three minutes.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Exactly. Iâ€™m like, â€œThree minutes? Sir, I am involved in a cricket match in Mumbai right now. Like, Iâ€™m a busy lady. I donâ€™t know what you got going on.â€
I didnâ€™t wanna fight during COVID. I hated all the fighting, so I tried it to avoid any situations, except at one point I had to drive through Kentucky and none of the normal gas stations were open. So I had to go to a back-ass hillbilly gas station, and I walked in and I had a mask on at the time, and the ladyâ€¦ there was only one person and thereâ€™s the lady working in there, and sheâ€™s smoking a cig. And in this hand, she had a scratch off lottery ticket and I thought, â€œOh, wow, she still has hope. I like it.â€ But when she saw my mask, she wentâ€¦ [GROANS] so I was like, â€œWhatever.â€ I went to the bathroom. I got a soda, I got pretzels and sat them down. She looked at me with such disdain. She goes, â€œI just want you to knowâ€¦ we donâ€™t got Corona here.â€ I said, â€œThatâ€™s okay because I mostly only drink Bud Light.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
And she goes, â€œWhat?â€ I go, â€œI know, right?â€ And then I ran away. I literally ran. I left the soda. I dropped $20. I made it rain. And then I ran away.
I was soâ€¦ and I was on a roll before COVID because Iâ€™ve been on the road for, like, 185 years and I was like, â€œYou know what? I should start doing some bucket list stuff that I wanna do before I decide to quit the road,â€ and one of the things Iâ€™ve always wanted to do was go ice fishing because it looks fun. And I booked myself at a casino in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. No. Yeah. If youâ€™ve never been there, uh, it is beautiful. Itâ€™s probably some of the most beautiful landscapes Iâ€™ve ever seen. But the people, um, I would describe them, and I think they would be proud of this, I would describe them as feral. Likeâ€¦ they are not properly socialized. Likeâ€¦ when youâ€™re talking to them, they have long pauses. Iâ€™m like, â€œAre we done or do you have more thoughts? This is not a normal rhythm to a conversation.â€
Theyâ€™re all real nice though. The lady in charge of the gig, I say, â€œCan you find somebody to take me ice fishing on Saturday? She called me back. She goes, â€œOkay, Kathleen, I found a guy thatâ€™s gonna take you and I promise heâ€™s not a pervert.â€ What? Why would you say something like that? Like, what are you trying to get out in front of? Whatâ€™s going on up here in the past? Because, I mean, Iâ€™m still going, but now Iâ€™m gonna be thinking about that the whole time. I mean, just looking at this strange man going in. Iâ€™m either gonna catch some fish or out of nowhere heâ€™s gonna sexually assault me. But then I thought, â€œYeah, but I bought so many different pieces of clothing from Bass Pro Shop.â€ I would almost challenge him like, â€œIf you could get it off, you win it because you wonâ€™tâ€¦ you wonâ€™t get it off because I donâ€™t know how I got it on. Iâ€™m never getting out of these clothes.â€
Be the first #MeToo from what I saw. #MeToo. I wanted to support the women of the Me Too Movement, but like at one point, I turned on CNN and they literally, the people in charge, were chasing Chuck Grassley downâ€¦ the senator from Iowa down a hallway to speak to him about the Me Too Movement. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Ladies, Chuck is an 88-year-old farmer from Iowa. He doesnâ€™t even understand why youâ€™re outâ€¦ like of the house. Like, â€œItâ€™s a Tuesday. Where are your children, you two bad whores? And if youâ€™re here, whoâ€™s making supper for your husband? I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s happening.â€ Heâ€™s 88. Heâ€™s not gonna get it. Donâ€™t waste your time on him, like, old guys, itâ€™sâ€¦ some of it is generational.
My dad doesnâ€™t get it and my dadâ€™s very liberal, but heâ€™s also 80. This is his â€œMe tooâ€ thing. He goes, â€œThis â€˜Me Tooâ€™ thing, I mean, obviously, I donâ€™t wanna see you girls get attacked at work.â€ Thanks, Dad. Thatâ€™s a good thought. I like going to work with that thought. You know what? Today, Dadâ€™s on my side about not getting attacked. He goes, â€œBut seriously, this for â€˜Me Tooâ€™ thing, are we gonna take it too far? Hmm? Are you not even gonna be able to wink at a gal in your office?â€ Nobodyâ€™s doing that anymore, Dad. I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ I donâ€™t know when it was popular, like, back in the â€™60s when Bewitched was on or whatever, and you guys would all go get shitfaced at lunch and then just go back and wink your ass off as nobody you thought was super-hot? Uh-uh.â€ All right, Dad, if you winked a little at a millennial, they wouldnâ€™t even know what you were doing. They would just be like, â€œOh, my God, thereâ€™s something wrong with Mr. Madiganâ€™s eye.â€ Like every time I walk by his office, heâ€™s likeâ€¦ Maybe he has that dry eye Jennifer Aniston talks about in those commercials, right? Like, we should get them those drops, as a secret Santa and just leave them there for him.
In the Me Too Movement, all the men that were accusedâ€¦ what was crazy is the media, it didnâ€™t matter who was accused, another rich, powerful boss guy, theyâ€™d go, â€œIs it this shocking?â€ No, because the men youâ€™re talking about are in charge and theyâ€™re the boss and they have money and power. Itâ€™ll be shocking, like, if you told me Jerry from the bowling alley did all that shit. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat? Stop it. Youâ€™re kidding me.â€ Jerry canâ€™t do it, because Jerry has no power. Jerry only has power over shoes. Thatâ€™s Jerryâ€™s area. And nobody cares about your bowling shoes. You take what youâ€™re given and youâ€™re happy.
Itâ€™s just that easy, but, like, no matter what guy, Charlie Rose was one of the big ones because they thought he was such an esteemed journalist, Charlie Rose, Iâ€™m not saying he did it. I have no idea. But to be accused, not shocking. It would be shocking if you told me Charlie Rose was a furry. Iâ€™ll be like, â€œWhat? No way. What animal is he? I wanna know. I judge peopleâ€¦ on what animal they chose.â€
And if you donâ€™t know what a furry is, do not feel stupid. I didnâ€™t know them until three years ago. I was sitting in a San Jose Marriot Bar that was attached to the convention center and it was my day off and all of these people in elaborate animal costumes started coming in and I was like, â€œWow, theyâ€™re impressive,â€ right? And Iâ€¦ in my mind, I thought, â€œOh, it must be a mascot convention,â€ right? You know, â€™cause they work alone, they probably like to get together and complain about work, like we all do. But then as they kept coming in, Iâ€™m like, â€œYou know, I know a lot about sports and I donâ€™t recognize any of these mascots.â€ So then all on my own, I decided, â€œOh, I bet itâ€™s minor league,â€ you know, because there are so many teams. You canâ€™t keep up. The Savannah Bananas, you know, like, too many.
So the bartender came back and I go, â€œWhenâ€¦ how long are the mascots in town?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat? Lady, those are furries.â€ I go, â€œOh, whatâ€™s a furry?â€ He goes, â€œWell, Iâ€™m not one of them and I donâ€™t wanna answer that question.â€ I said, â€œWell, my phoneâ€™s dead. Come on, I canâ€™t Google it.â€ He goes, â€œWell, theyâ€™re like Millennial type age people and they like to dress up like animals. And then they come to these conventions and some of them just wanna be the animal and then others wanna hook up as the animal.â€ Okay. I said, â€œWell, can I just ask one follow-up question? Um, if, if youâ€™re gonna hook up, do you have to stay within your species or is that taboo? Like can the beagle get with the iguana if nobody knows, or likeâ€¦?â€ he was like, â€œYeah.â€ And then he walked away. Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, I still wanted a beer. I know that you didnâ€™t like that conversation.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWow. Thatâ€™s what a lot of the Millennials are doing on weekends.â€
And you know what? I am a fan of the Millennials because theyâ€™re the first generation that has realized that if you live with your parents long enough, eventually theyâ€™ll be glad youâ€™re there. Yes! Itâ€™s gonna take a while, but grind it out, Millennials â€™cause when yourâ€¦ when your parents are 85 and they see you in the kitchen, theyâ€™ll be like, â€œHey, can you drive at night? Thatâ€™s fantastic. We wanna go to bingo on Friday at 8:00. Whatâ€™s your name again? Matt? Okay, Matt. So, Matt, did you leave ever or did you fail and come back, or did you justâ€¦ have you been here? We forgot.â€
I am frequently shocked though when youâ€™re dealing with Millennials in the general public and I think itâ€™s kind of nice I guess that they truly believe on some level that strangers care about them. Likeâ€¦ I was in Loweâ€™s and I had all these tiny paint samples and paint brushes, I justâ€¦ I set â€™em down. And then Iâ€¦ the guy was like 30 whatever, and I go, â€œHey, how are you doing, man?â€ He goes, â€œUh, not good, lady. Not good.â€ He said, â€œI just saw the work schedule and I was supposed to have three days off in a row because I worked three days in a row, and I donâ€™t. And I donâ€™t even know if I wanna work here anymore.â€ And in my head, I thought, â€œOh, my God, he thought I meant that.â€ I donâ€™t really care how you are, sir. I barely care that Iâ€™m here. Iâ€¦ that was just a pleasantry. Those are nice things you say to keep society moving and forward progress so we donâ€™t kill each other with barbecue equipment on weekends, like nobody cares. Yeah.
Iâ€¦ thatâ€™s why I think we could use a little bit more to people being nice in public and pleasant because I think everybody forgot to behave, how to behave in the general public, like I went into a Taco Bellâ€¦ yeah, like, be nice. Itâ€™s not that hard. People have just flipped their lids likeâ€¦ I went to a Taco Bell. Now, thereâ€™s only two girls, theyâ€™re probably in their 20s and thereâ€™s only two employees â€™cause weâ€™re not employees anymore. Oneâ€™s trying to fix the drive-thru which is broken, which is why I went in and thereâ€™s one girl thatâ€™s gonna wait on me and thereâ€™s a man ahead of me. Heâ€™s about mid-60s. She tells him theyâ€™re completely out of mild sauce. And he loses it. He just loses it. And he starts yelling and screaming. And in my mind, Iâ€™m like, â€œDude, that is the last lady on the Titanic handing out life jackets. Like, donâ€™t piss her off because thatâ€™s the 20-somethings, they will quit, sir. I donâ€™t think you understand. They will fucking leave in a minute.â€ And they all agree on that. Itâ€™s like they formed a union without ever having a meeting. Itâ€™sâ€¦ and I think their union should be called â€œYeah, no,â€ â€™cause they wonâ€™t.
[CROWD CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
And good for them, you know, â€™cause it never occurred to our generation. â€œHey, I could just leave here.â€ Nope. Never even thought about it. â€œOh, man, this blows but Iâ€™m gonna stay â€™cause I thought Iâ€™d die.â€ But Iâ€™m looking at him going, heâ€™s still yelling at the girl. Iâ€™m like, â€œIf she quits, sir, do you understand we have to do it. Do you know how to make a gordita? I donâ€™t. I want a soft-shelled chalupa, no idea.â€ Then I went out to the car and my sister goes, â€œOh, I saw that guy losing his mind. What was he saying?â€ I said, â€œIt doesnâ€™t even matter what he was saying. I can tell you this though, I know it was for, uh, certainty. We as a nation are not prepared for war.â€ That was mild sauce. Not even fire. He went that crazy.
Sometimes I wish the Millennials could be a little more flexible though â€™cause I think theyâ€™re linear, â€™cause they grew up with the computer, they fully trust the computer, um, to the point where sometimes theyâ€™re likeâ€¦ I was babysitting my brotherâ€™s three kids, and I called to get pizzas to be delivered and the girl goes, â€œWhatâ€™s the address?â€ And I gave it to her. She goes, â€œHmm, yeah, thatâ€™s not coming up on GPS so we canâ€™t bring your pizza.â€ Oh. Iâ€™m like, â€œCan we do it the old way or Iâ€™ll just tell you how to get here and then youâ€™ll come with pizza and then Iâ€™ll just throw a bunch of crumpled dollar bills in your direction with tips and all that?â€ She goes, â€œNo, because we were taught in training that if you go to a house that has a GPS address that doesnâ€™t come up, thatâ€™s exactly how you get lured to your own death.â€ What? So I said, just to seeâ€¦ I wanted to see if I would get a reaction, I go, â€œYeah. â€˜Cause I remember like in the â€™70s and â€™80s all those pizza kids that were murdered, like every weekend weâ€™d lose another 400 and then more signed up. I donâ€™t even know. That was just in the Midwest. I donâ€™t even know the coastal counts.â€ And she just goes, â€œYeah. Bye.â€
Like I donâ€™tâ€¦ she may have believed it, not sure. Theyâ€™re a trusting bunch, the Millennials, which I appreciate. I like, I think itâ€™s nice. I donâ€™t think my group, not trusting at all. Like during COVID, one of the things that was really weird is like, most of my normal friends and my relatives, they still had to go to work so they had stuff to do so nobody wanted to participate in my world. And, like, one day I called my brother, he worked at a bank and I go, â€œHey, Pat, youâ€™re not gonna believe this but thereâ€™s a king cobra loose in Grand Prairie, Texas â€™cause some asshole forgot to put the lid on his â€œcobra cage,â€ and itâ€™s just running around a normal neighborhood. And my brother goes, â€œWell, youâ€™re not gonna believe this Kathleen, but I have a job.â€ And he hung up. Boo. Boo, Patrick. So then I texted him, I knew that would make him mad, Iâ€™m like, â€œSo I guess you donâ€™t care about the zebras loose in Maryland either then, do you, Pat? You wanna know more? Call me back.â€
So I didnâ€™t have anybody to talk to so I thought, wellâ€¦ I started Madiganâ€™s Pubcast â€™cause I thought, â€œWell, thereâ€™s gonna be a lot ofâ€ yeah, itâ€™s fun, people. Somebody wants to hear these stories, right? â€˜Cause theyâ€™re true. Itâ€™s important thereâ€™s a cobra loose for Christâ€™s sake. But I had a Millennial hit me up on Instagram and she wrote, â€œIâ€™m coming to see your show in Austin â€™cause I love your podcast. I didnâ€™t know you were a comedian.â€ Okay. Fair enough, you know? Sheâ€™s young, whatever. Fair enough. But I was very curious. I go, just out of curiosity, â€™cause she had bought a ticket, I go, â€œWhat did you think I was gonna do when you got there?â€ And she wrote back, â€œWell, I didnâ€™t know.â€ I thought, â€œWow, thatâ€™s so trusting.â€ Like Iâ€™m 56, Iâ€™ve never bought a ticket to a surprise show in my life. I got 37 bucks. Letâ€™s see whatâ€™s going on in that building.
I do wish the Millennials though would step it up in this one department. I would like them to run for office. Iâ€™d like them to try to be in charge. Yeah, â€™cause the people in charge right now, um, we are being governed by a Florida Bridge club andâ€¦ nobody seems alarmed and nobody wants to say nothing â€™cause youâ€™re being mean to Meemaw. No, I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t give a shit anymore. It has gottenâ€¦ it has gone over the rainbow. Chuck Grassley, the 88-year-old from Iowa, announced on Twitter, and I know heâ€™s doing his own tweets. You know how I know that? Because he signs them. Okay, Papaw, you donâ€™t have to do that. He announced heâ€™s running again. No, Papaw, no. You are 88. You go home now. Thatâ€™s what you do when youâ€™re 88. And it doesnâ€™tâ€¦ yeah.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
It doesnâ€™t mean that you donâ€™t have worth and you donâ€™t have value, but you gotta find something else to do instead of being in charge of 350 million people. Okay, Papaw?
Hereâ€™sâ€¦ like, my dad was a lawyer, my dad retired, and then my dad became a golf marshal. Thatâ€™s appropriate. If you donâ€™t know what a golf marshal is, itâ€™s an old guy that gets in a cart and then he drives around the course and yells at other old people to hurry their asses up because not everybody has 11 hours to play four holes. And itâ€™s both sides of the aisle. I mean, thereâ€™s no difference.
I mean Nancy Pelosi, I donâ€™t really know for sure how old she is, but some days I know for sure her teeth donâ€™t fit right. I know that. I know that. â€˜Cause it happens to my mom. Itâ€™s a bridge issue. Thereâ€™s like a clip that goes on that fang tooth and if it slips, itâ€™s not good. Like my mom will be speaking like a totally normal human being and then itâ€™s just full-on Liza Minnelli, [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Mom, fix it. Clip it back on. You sound like youâ€™re having a stroke andâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. But Nancy will do it live on TV, just come out for a press conference. â€œHi, everybody, itâ€™s me, Nancy Pelosi. And today Iâ€™d like youâ€¦ Iâ€™d like to discuss insurance. Iâ€™m like, â€œAh, fix it.â€ â€œAffordable healthcare insurance, thatâ€™s what I like to talk about. I donâ€™t know sign language. It looks like I do. Actually, my hands just do this â€™cause Iâ€™m Italian. We talk with our hands. Thatâ€™s why I have such good skin â€™cause Iâ€™m Italian. Iâ€™m actuallyâ€¦ Iâ€™m 64. Nobody knows that.â€
No. No. Over 80. Mitch McConnell, the talking turtle from Kentucky. No, I just canâ€™t look at you anymore. Itâ€™s over now. The manâ€™s never voted yes for anything, you know? â€œI vote no on everything. Thatâ€™s my thing. Sometimes if I havenâ€™t voted no in a while, Iâ€™ll write a bill just to vote against myself so I stay in practice.â€ And Iâ€™m not saying the Millennials would be any smarter, I donâ€™t know. But I know for sure they donâ€™t have grudges that go back so far, theyâ€™re not repairable because I havenâ€™t had the time to have â€™em. When you hear these, these people fighting, and Mitch McConnell, â€œWell, I remember when Nancy Pelosi voted against the Spanish-American War.â€ I was like, â€œYou California-salad-eating- pie-nut-loving-fruitcake-piece-of-shit, them boys at the Alamo would be alive if it wasnâ€™t for Nancy Pelosi.â€ And so the only time Iâ€™ve ever voted yes in my life, reinforcements for Mr. David Crockett.â€
Stop. Itâ€™s crazy. And then who are we presented with? More 80-somethings. Bernie Sanders said heâ€™s probably pretty sure heâ€™s gonna run again. Bernie is like from the Bible old. Like Iâ€¦ if you could bet on DraftKings, one person is still alive from the Bible, Iâ€™d throw a hundred on Bernie. Iâ€™m like, â€œYes.â€ And I liked Bernie. I had a soft spot for him â€™cause to me, every time he showed up somewhere, he always looked like he may have just been involved in a car accident. â€œIâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m late. Let me take off my mittens. The maid in Vermont by a woman named Naomi. If youâ€™d like a pair, go to my website.â€ I thought Biden was too old. And I donâ€™t know why nobody helps the guy, like I donâ€™t get it. Like when heâ€™s out giving speeches, I would do it for free. Iâ€™ll be in charge ofâ€¦ Iâ€™ll be in charge of him â€™cause hereâ€™s what I would say to him, I go, â€œJoe, hereâ€™s the deal. Guess what? Weâ€™re not gonna do anymore story times. Weâ€™re notâ€¦ ixnay on the stories, okay? â€˜Cause itâ€™sâ€¦ theyâ€™re very dated, stick to the script. And what Iâ€™m gonna do for you, Joe, is Iâ€™m gonna stay on side stage with a burlap bag full of tennis balls. And any time you start going off-script and telling a story, Iâ€™m gonna throw a tennis ball in your direction, not at you, just so you see it and you go, â€˜Oh, shit. Right. Iâ€™m not supposed to do that.â€™ Right. Right.â€ Because at one point he kept repeating the story, no oneâ€™s ever stopped him. Itâ€™s a story about when he was a teenager and there was another gang somewhere in Delaware and that gang leader was named Corn Pop. And he said, â€œRemember the night before a gang fight how youâ€™d take that straight razor and youâ€™d put it in a rain barrel to let it get rusty all night?â€ â€œAh-ah, tennis ball, where is the tennis ball?â€ â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ A straight razor? No, I donâ€™tâ€¦ sound like weâ€™re in the Westerns where they go like that on their face and then youâ€™re saying you put it in water on purpose to get it rusty to then, I guess when you stabbed people, to give them tetanus? Like, this is sociopathic. No. I thought Trump was too old. But hereâ€™s where I knew he was definitely too old because whenever he gives speeches in any state that has any relationship with coal or coal mining, he gets up front, everybody goes, â€œYou know what Iâ€™m gonna do? Iâ€™m gonna open, like, a bazillion, gillion, trillion new coal mines. And weâ€™re gonna have coal everywhere. And all the young people are gonna be so happy because they could be coal miners and they can stay in their area.â€ Part of me thought, â€œYou know what? I think he believes that in, in some way but I think you believe that because youâ€™re too old.â€ Because I have met 50,000 Millennials on the road and I have not yet met one that I think would agree to be a coal miner. And nor should they. I would give everything I have though to see their reaction to the job description of coal mining, just sitting on their phones, half-ass paying attention to me, â€œSo wait. What? So, like, you want me to go into Earth in the daytime, in a rollercoaster to get rocks, like rocks? Well, will my phone work down there because I wonâ€™t do it if I canâ€™t TikTok. Thatâ€™s my thing. So, yeah, no.â€
I tried to learn to TikTok over the pandemic. My nieces love it, but theyâ€™re 13 and theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™ll show you, Aunt Kath.â€ And they show me their phones and I watch them. If youâ€™ve never seen TikTok, itâ€™s just a barrage of videos. And I put them down and theyâ€™re like, â€œYou didnâ€™t like it, did you?â€ I go, â€œWell, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ll say about it, â€˜I feel like I just sat next to someone who did an eight ball.'â€ [LAUGHTER] â€œNope.â€ Iâ€™m a drinker, not a drugger, so nope.â€ And they go like, â€œOh, are you saying itâ€™s, like, too much?â€ I go, â€œYeah, itâ€™s way too much. I canâ€™tâ€¦ I canâ€™t process it.â€ They go, â€œYeah. But just because our videos are mostly dance, and music, and stuff, like you could build your own and it wonâ€™t be as crazy.â€ I said, â€œAll right.â€ So I signed up and I donâ€™t know how it decides what your first batch of videos is gonna be. But my first batch, all of my people were in hospice. I was likeâ€¦ [LAUGHTER] â€œThis is horrible. Why would anybody watch this? Why, why is this entertaining?â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œDonâ€™t watch it too long or youâ€™ll get a lot more of them.â€ I was like, â€œWhat?â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œMm-hmm. Too late. You went past six seconds.â€ They go, â€œDid you ever watch one somewhere?â€ I go, â€œOkay. On Instagram, I did. I watched a hospice video. Maybe they know that because the girl was so young, she was like 26 years old. She was sadly dying. But she had said it all started with her eye twitching, and at the time, my left eye had been twitching for like two and a half weeks, I just know I was tired running around.â€ Then I was like, â€œShit. I didnâ€™t know it could end like this.â€ Like, this isâ€¦
Iâ€™d prefer Instagram because itâ€™s passive. Itâ€™s justâ€¦ yeah. Itâ€™s just, â€œOh, look, beagle, puppy. Beagleâ€¦ oh, thereâ€™s a cat eating a popsicle.â€ Itâ€™s just pleasant. Thereâ€™s nothing bad. People are nice on Instagram. Like Twitter, I like it, but itâ€™s aggressive. You better be ready. Itâ€™s like walking into a bar at midnight and everybodyâ€™s had shots except you. Yeah. â€œWell, look what the cat dragged in with a little opinion about nothing.â€ And Iâ€™ve tweeted about everything and never really got any backlash, except, it was shockingâ€¦ sports. Who would think? Youâ€™d think itâ€™d be politics orâ€¦ nope, nope, nope, nope. Just sports. One day, I just tweeted out, because Iâ€™m from St. Louis, I tweeted out, â€œGo Cards.â€ Thatâ€™s all I wrote. â€œShut your whore, bitch mouth.â€ Hold on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That was uncalled for, okay? I didnâ€™t type, â€œFuck the Cubs,â€ did I? No. I typed, â€œGo Cards.â€ Thatâ€™s all I said. So I donâ€™t tweet about sports anymore.
Facebook, I donâ€™t love it. I have it for work. But I donâ€™t like Mark Zuckerberg, yeah, because I feel like he stole all of our information. He sold it 17 times around the globe to Sunday and he never really paid a price for that.
Right.
[APPLAUSE]
And sadly, last summer, we had him in front of a senate committee, but the people asking the questions were so old. I truly think they were just excited to meet him. I do. â€œWell, hello there, Mr. Zuckerberg. I joined the Facebook on a Sunday morning. Super happy youâ€™re here because, coincidentally, I forgot my password. It used to be 1234 then the wife said that was too easy. And I changed it but I donâ€™t remember. So I was hoping at the break you could help me retrieve the said password. My parents like it, but theyâ€™re 80.â€ They get up in the morning, they drink coffee, and then they troll the entire family, every second cousin, third cousin, people we lived by when I was five. Thatâ€™s their morning entertainment. Thatâ€™s what I told my teenage nieces and nephews, Iâ€™m like, â€œUh, heads up, if I were you guys, I would not friend Grandpa, or Grandma for that matter. They look innocent and they seem nice, but theyâ€™re spies. Thatâ€™s what they are. Theyâ€™re flat-out spies. Theyâ€™re gonna go through your whole feed and theyâ€™re gonna read everything and then theyâ€™re gonna tell your parents who are too busy for that shit and report back.â€ Well, one nephew goes, â€œWell, I already friended Grandpa.â€ I go, â€œWell, I would unfriend Grandpa.â€ And he goes, â€œWell, I think it would hurt his feelings.â€ I said, â€œWell, if he were to notice, which he will not, just tell him it broke. There will be no further questions, because theyâ€™ll accept that.â€ â€œHuh. All right. It broke.â€ Both of ourâ€¦ both of our parents just turned 80. And I go, â€œYou know what? Youâ€™re the age. Youâ€™re the exact age, as a matter of fact, of people that are running this country.â€ I said, â€œHonestly, do you think you could be the president?â€ And my dad goes, â€œUh, do you mean individually?â€ I said, â€œAs compared to what?â€ He goes, â€œAs a couple. Could we do it as a couple?â€ I go, â€œWhat?â€ â€œWell, you know, like, some days, I donâ€™t remember anything, but your mom will remember all kinds of stuff. Itâ€™s weird. And in other days, she wonâ€™t remember shit.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œI got you. I got it.â€ â€œTogether, weâ€™re probably about 68.â€ He said. But individually, Christ, no, Kathleen, we canâ€™t. I donâ€™t even know where the car is at.â€ I think the cutoff should be 70 or 75. Thatâ€™s fair enough, right? If you have to be a minimum age, there should be a maximum age. Like itâ€¦ because Iâ€™ve seen the difference in my parents between, say, 70 and 80. Like 70, everything was pretty much all right, Iâ€™d say. Eighty, oh, now, whenever I see them, theyâ€™re completely covered in Band Aids. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œWow. What are you guys doing? Are you, like, stabbing each other with pencils for fun?â€ My dadâ€™s like, â€œNo, no, no. Itâ€™s the medication we take, Kathleen. Youâ€™re barely banging or something, thereâ€™s blood shooting everywhere. Itâ€™s a problem. Itâ€™s a problem. We canâ€™t even go to your sisterâ€™s house because of that cat. Weâ€™ll bleed out over there. We will bleed out.â€ He goes, â€œLook at these scratch marks. These are three weeks old, Kathleen. Theyâ€¦ we donâ€™t heal anymore either. Thatâ€™s a new thing. We donâ€™t heal.â€ And I looked and I go, â€œOh, my God. Let me go get the new skin.â€ â€œIt wonâ€™t work. We tried it. Hereâ€™s the problem with new skin, it turns out your skin, you have to have enough skin to connect with that other skin and weâ€™re running out of skin. I donâ€™t know what comes after this.â€ [LAUGHTER] At 80, thereâ€™s so many health problems that, like, nothingâ€™s alarming anymore. Itâ€™s like, oh, okay. I called. They were in Florida and I said, â€œHey, what are you guys doing?â€ My mom goes, â€œWell, weâ€™re going to the hospital because your dad thinks he might be having another heart attack.â€ I said, â€œOh, shit.â€ I go, â€œWell, let me talk to him.â€ She goes, â€œWell, no, heâ€™s driving.â€ [LAUGHTER] I go, â€œSeriously, Mom?â€ â€œI know itâ€™s crazy, Kathleen, but he said if I drive, he sure will have a heart attack. And right now, it could be indigestion. We ate spicy food last night.â€ I donâ€™t love calling there â€™cause he has his hearing aids. And if you call somebody with hearing aids on his cell phone, this is all youâ€™re probably gonna hear on your endâ€¦ â€œEeeeeeeâ€¦â€ and they donâ€™t hear you going, â€œHello?â€ They donâ€™t hear it because the stupidest system Iâ€™ve ever heard of, the hearing aid company decided that when a hearing aid battery is going even slightly low, they decided the good idea would be to have the hearing aid make a noise to alert the hard-of-hearing person, which they donâ€™t hear. Everyone else hears it. Dogs in the neighborhood are going allâ€¦ [MIMICS DARK BARKING] Whatâ€™s that?â€ [MIMICS DARK BARK] Like, what a dumbass system. Like when the hearing aid is about to go dead, that thing should start vibrating in his ear and then fly around the house like that ball in Harry Potter till he grabs it out of the air.
And then when they get older, thereâ€™s less to talk about because they do less, you know. So when I call, thatâ€™s fine, but like they golf. They like to golf. So if I ask my dad, how was golf, oh, 45-minute answer. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s a dude thing. He will go through every hole, every club, every putt, how he was in the woods versus my mom, nope. â€œMom, how was golf?â€ â€œI saw a fox.â€ Yes. Thank you. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m looking for. Short, concise, interesting, animal-based. Jesus Christ.
She has an iPhone because I bought it and I sincerely wish I hadnâ€™t because now, every time it breaks, she calls me. Sheâ€™s like, â€œKathleen, that iPhone you bought me broke again so I took it to Walmart.â€ Random. â€œWe didnâ€™t buy it at Walmart, but whatever, Mom. Youâ€™re 80. Take all your broken shit into Walmart. Just throw it on the ground. Start crying. Maybe somebody will fix it. Maybe youâ€™ll be arrested, whatever. You got to nothing else going on. Do it.â€ She said, â€œNo, they wonâ€™t. They wonâ€™t help you. I went back to that phone counter and there was a young guy working there and he asked me a question. I answered it, and then he started laughing. And then another kid came out, I asked the same question. And this went on through three people, Kathleen.â€ I said, â€œWell, what was the question?â€ She said, â€œWell, he kept saying, who is your provider? And I kept saying, my daughter.â€
[LAUGHTER]
No. I am notâ€¦ Iâ€™m not your provider, but Iâ€™m, like, yourâ€¦ your supplier. Like a drug deal, I gave you the supply.â€ She goes, â€œWell, whoâ€™s our provider as of right now?â€ I said, â€œOur provider is Sprint because we donâ€™t care about service.â€ Sprint is so shilly. But I donâ€™t care because some days, I donâ€™t like getting calls, you know. Let the Lord decide whoâ€™s getting through. Iâ€™llâ€¦ Iâ€™m involved in a cricket match in Mumbai. I donâ€™t have that kind of time.
Sprint is so strange, though. I think Iâ€™veâ€¦ I think I stay because Iâ€™m curious because, like, it doesnâ€™t work in places where it should work like here or Chicago, you know, cities, like, it doesnâ€™t really work. But then out of nowhere, itâ€™ll work in some random ass place. Thatâ€™s why I like if youâ€™re gonna go out drinking, and you think things might get crazy and maybe go off the rails, you should make sure somebody in your group has Sprint because like if we got completely shitfaced tonight and ended up in one of El Chapoâ€™s tunnels, and people were like, â€œOh, my God. Well, how can we get out? Our phones wonâ€™t work.â€ Oh, yeah, bitches. Whoâ€™s got four bars? Sprint does. Thatâ€™s right.
[LAUGHS]
Itâ€™s never even truly bothered me, except one time I flew to South Dakota and my plan was Iâ€™m gonna get off the plane and Uber to this casino deal. Well, when I landed, my phone was just goingâ€¦ [MIMICS ERROR TONE] like a tornado warning or something crazy. And then it started blinking. Iâ€™ve never seen anything happen before like that. â€œYou are now internationally roaming.â€ Oh, Sprint. Iâ€™m in South Dakota. Thereâ€™s another one on top of it. Iâ€™m not even near a border, you morons.
But then I was curious to see if they had Uber, and thereâ€™s nobody in the airport. Itâ€™s small. Itâ€™s pretty much empty, but thereâ€™s an old lady in a card table that just says â€œinformation.â€ And sheâ€™s doing the crossword puzzle and I walked out. But I was very respectful and polite. I go, â€œExcuse me, maâ€™am. I was just curious. Do you guys have Uber here?â€ Sheâ€™d never stop doing the crossword puzzle. She goes, â€œI donâ€™t know anyone by the name of Uber. But if you need a ride, I can have Darryl come get you.â€ No. â€˜Cause when she said â€œget,â€ I heard â€œtake.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo. Iâ€™m not getting in the car with Darryl.â€ So, then I thought, â€œWell, Iâ€™ll just rent a car. The phone ainâ€™t working anyway.â€ And I rent from Avis and I love Avis. And hereâ€™s why, â€™cause if you rent a lot of times from Avis, you get in their frequent renter club. And their frequent renter club is the Wizard Club. So, you become a wizard, right? And they send you a card in the mail, like, mine said Wizard Madigan. And Iâ€¦ you would not think that that would excite me at this age, but it was so awesome. I was so excited. And then the greatest part is, like, if youâ€™re in a bigger city where they have the shuttle, when the Avis shuttle pulls up, a full-grown adult has to look at me, another full-grown adult and without laughingâ€¦ say, â€œAre you a wizard?â€ [BLOWS RASPBERRIES] God damn right Iâ€™m a wizard. Come on. Just once before I quit the road, I wanna get dressed up from head to toe as a wizard. And I donâ€™t wanna wait at the Avis shuttle spot and Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t wanna have luggage or nothing. I wanna have one of those scepter sticks with the ball on the end. And then when the driver pulls up, he goes, â€œAre you a wizard?â€ I wanna go, â€œAhh!â€ â€™cause at best, Iâ€™m a crazy lady. At worst, Iâ€™m a real wizard and I just did something horrible. My parents go to Florida in the winter â€™cause itâ€™s warmer than Missouri. Thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m from, the State of Missouri. Oh, that was such a smattering polite applause. I know people donâ€™t know how to react. Itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s in the middle. At least you guys have an idea of where itâ€™s at, in Colorado. But like the Coast? No. I was in California. Itâ€™s a bar. The girl says, â€œIâ€™m gonna need to see your license.â€ I gave it to her. She goes, â€œMissouri. Is that by Minnesota?â€ I said, â€œIt is. In the â€™80s, we moved all the Mâ€™s together so they could be in the middle for the M, you know. Like, we moved Montana over and then that kicked Iowa even further by the â€œIâ€™sâ€ like Illinois and Indiana.â€ And she just went, â€œOh.â€ And walked away. I went, â€œOh, my God. I think she believed me.â€ Thatâ€™s not true. Donâ€™t tell your friends that. That is not true. I grew up in St. Louis and I grew up a lot in the Ozarks. And lately, there have been a lot of shows about the Ozarks. And my mom is so upset. Sheâ€™s like, â€œHave you seen these shows about the Ozarks?â€ â€˜Cause they live their full-time in Florida.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œI just find it awful. Theyâ€™re making us look like hillbillies. And, Kathleen, we have a Panera now.â€ [LAUGHTER] Itâ€™s getting more modern, but that hillbilly thing is still definitely there. Last Christmas Eve, me and my brother, I said, â€œBefore we go back to Mom and Dadâ€™s, letâ€™s just stop and get a beer.â€ And we went to some back ass Ozark hillbilly bar and we walked in. Weâ€™re the only two people. Great. But a guy comes in, and Missouri is an open-carry state. That used to mean liquor. Now it just means any weapon you can find on the Internet, like a cannon. Bring it. Fuck it. Nobody cares. Bow and arrow, youâ€™re good. No problem. Guns, it doesnâ€™t matter. Itâ€™s just a free for all. But this guy walked in with a gun on each hip and he sat down on the barstool and he ordered three Bud Lights and three shots of Fireball. Yeah. Heâ€™s alone, right? So, heâ€™s here. Iâ€™m here. My brotherâ€™s here. So, I moved from this bar stool around to this side, putting my brother in the line of fire in the event that hillbilly hell decides to shoot a gun tonight for fun or some shit. But I knew heâ€™d see me do it and I knew it might cost a thing. And he looked at me and he goes, â€œYou scared of this?â€ And I knew he meant the guns. Well, I go, â€œNo. Iâ€™m not scared of Bud Light. Thatâ€™s crazy talk.â€ I said, â€œIâ€™m not scared of your Fireball either. I love Fireball every now and then. And Iâ€™m not even scared of your guns. But altogetherâ€¦
[CROWD LAUGHS]
â€¦I find it a little concerning.â€ And then he said, â€œSo, you donâ€™t believe in the Second Amendment? Well, now before you answer that question, you have to think about it â€™cause itâ€™s gonna deem how the rest of your nightâ€™s gonna go. And I had already ordered nachos, right?â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
So, I said, â€œI will only discuss the Second Amendment if you could name another amendment.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
[CROWD CHEERING]
[CHUCKLES] And thatâ€™s when my brother got mad at me. Heâ€™s like, â€œGoddammit. Can you ever just keep your mouth shut, Kathleen? We were having a nice time. Is this where you wanna die? Is it? You wanna die at the drunken catfish? â€˜Cause this is whatâ€™s gonna happen when you mouth off off like that.â€ I said, â€œPatrick, youâ€™re getting way too upset. He didnâ€™t even understand my joke. Like, some jokes are just for me. He shot his Fireball and smiled. Weâ€™re good. Everything is good. Everything is fine.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
It gets too cold for my mom and dad there, though. It doesnâ€™t get as cold as when I was a kid. I mean, somethingâ€™s happening. I donâ€™t know what with the weather. But, like, when I was in fifth grade, that year we had 57 snow days. Yup, 57. And we never made them up.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Nope. The nun said, â€œFuck it. School is over on May 26th. And donâ€™t even think about bringing those little rat bastards back around here because this conventâ€™s got a float trip down the Merrimack scheduled and weâ€™re going.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Thatâ€™s why, like, when my friends with grade school kids or my younger siblings that have grade school kids during COVID, when it was an online homeschooling, they were all just unraveling. One phone call was worse than the next. â€œThis is ridiculous. I donâ€™t even know how to do sixth grade math anymore. Science, I never understood to begin with. Iâ€™m drinking margaritas at 9:00 in the morning so I donâ€™t kill people in this house.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
At one point, I told my younger sister, I go, â€œJust donâ€™t do it.â€ She goes, â€œWhat?â€ I go, â€œJust donâ€™t do it. It doesnâ€™t matter. I missed 57 days of fifth grade. And so far in my life, itâ€™s never come up.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Iâ€™ve never been in a bar where somebody said something and I was the only one shocked, like, â€œWhat?â€ We had a Civil War? Shut up. I never heard about that. Maybeâ€¦â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
My parents like Florida. I donâ€™t really, totally get it. They leave the day after Christmas and then they come back on Easter. Like Jesus, they rise from the State of Florida back to my brotherâ€™s backyard in Missouri. They just reappear. Iâ€™m like, â€œWow, youâ€™re back. And thereâ€™s still two of you. Well done. I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing down there, but you look wonderful.â€ Thereâ€¦ thereâ€™s a lot of drinking going on down there with the old people in the retirement places. Like, my mom goes, â€œI want you to go to my golf league and meet my friends.â€ I said, â€œOkay. What time do we tee-off, 8:00? But I like to get there at 6:00.â€ What? I said, â€œNo, Mom. 7:00.â€ Iâ€™ll go. â€œAll right. Fine.â€ So, we go at 7:00. I meet all of her friends. I get in the golf cart at 7:40 AM. I go, â€œMom, your friends are a lot of fun, but what exactly is wrong with that lady, Marybeth?â€ She goes, â€œOh, well, sheâ€™s hammered.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
I said, â€œDear Mom, it is 7:40 in the morning.â€ She goes, â€œWell, we donâ€™t have a relationship with time anymore, Kathleen. We donâ€™t really live within time. Weâ€™re like out of time. Weâ€™re in a different dimension than you people that are in real time.â€ She goes, â€œYou know, I mean, some days we wake up at 3:00. Some days 6:00. I mean, today, Iâ€™ve already had lasagna.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Oh, my God. Iâ€™ll tell you what, though, if you ever think you have a drinking problem, go down to Florida and hang out with those old people â€™cause they will do stuff for you, like, â€œWhoa. Hey, Jameson and toast?â€ Like, Iâ€™ve never even thought about that. Iâ€™m fine. Like, Iâ€™m fine.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
I never truly have ever thought I had a drinking problem till about three years ago. I was in Nashâ€¦ I flew in Nashville and I rented a car and my friend goes, â€œOh, people are coming over. Can you stop and get some wine?â€ I said, â€œSure.â€ I donâ€™t know the liquor laws in every state. So, I go into a grocery store and I get a bottle of red, a bottle of white, sat them down. The lady looks at me with complete disdain and she goes, â€œMaâ€™am, those are not for sale.â€ I said, â€œWell, I donâ€™t wanna freak anybody out, but thereâ€™s a whole aisle of them.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
And they have price tags on them. That front door is open and that cash register is on. So, to somebody who ainâ€™t from around here, this whole situation implies that a saleâ€™s going down. And she said, and I quote, â€œMaâ€™am, Tennessee is a Christian state.â€ Now I didnâ€™t say nothing right there â€™cause I still wanted the wine. I thought I was in the game, right? I just let that one go. Itâ€™s hard, but I let it go. She goes, â€œAnd you are not allowed to buy wine on Sundays.â€ Now, I might have been okay if she just stopped there, but she kept going. She goes, â€œBut you can buy beer.â€ What? I go, â€œCan I ask you something? And Iâ€™m notâ€¦ Iâ€™m not from here. Iâ€™m not trying to be sarcastic.â€ And she goes, â€œYou may.â€ I said, â€œWell, Iâ€™m not from here and Iâ€™m catholic, so I donâ€™t really know anything about the Bible, butâ€¦â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
â€¦too vague, too long, sorry. I donâ€™t have the time. But I do thinkâ€¦ I remember a story from the Bible about Jesus turning water into wine. And I donâ€™t think I have ever heard a story about Jesus turning water into beer. So, maybe you can explain to me why the Christians in the state of Tennessee will make Jesus a beer guy when clearly He was a wine guy. Like, thatâ€™s documented.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Now thereâ€™s two men behind me. A guy and an older guy with overalls on and he leaves and the old guy in the overalls, he says to me, â€œMaâ€™am, itâ€™s just all about the alcohol content.â€ I go, â€œRight. But, like, if I drink 20 beers, Iâ€™d be way more drunk than if I just had a glass of wine with dinner, right?â€ He goes, â€œYeah. Youâ€™re right. I didnâ€™t even know what I meant. I just heard that on the TV when they were talking about it.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Wow. Iâ€™m like, Iâ€™m in a circle of stupid and I started it. And now I canâ€™t get out. Now sheâ€™s mad at him, too, the old lady. She saidâ€¦ weâ€™re both in the penalty box. And she goes, â€œI want you both to know I donâ€™t find any of this humorous.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
I said, â€œMe neither.â€ And I left â€™cause I got my wine. And then as I was walking to the car, I was getting madder and madder. And then I thought, â€œWait a minute. Iâ€™m getâ€¦ maybe I have a drinking problem. Iâ€™m getting way too angry about two shitty bottles of wine.â€ But then I was like, â€œNo. If I had a drinking problem, Iâ€™d have bought the beer â€™cause a drink is a drink at some level.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Iâ€™m on cheat day with alcohol, too. Wine, I donâ€™t care what kind. Boxed wine, fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. I donâ€™t know whoâ€™s doing their marketing but theyâ€™re not selling their biggest selling points. The two biggest selling points to me about the boxed wine first and foremost, especially if you have judgey neighbors, it makes no noise in the trash. Thatâ€™s right.
[CROWD APPLAUDING]
â€œWhatâ€™d you do all weekend?â€ â€œNothing. Itâ€™s super quiet.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
The other thing is you can always get into a box of wine. Iâ€™ve been given bottles of wine on the road, go back to the hotel. Shit. No wine opener. And then, boom, the cork breaks. Oh, sad times. No wine. Thatâ€™s never gonna happen with a box of wine. â€˜Cause even if that sprout deal breaks off, you can stab it. You can stab the box. Youâ€™re getting in if youâ€™re determined. Even with a pair of tweezers, you can get in there. But hold them tight â€™cause sometimes if it hits it, it could slide backwards and cut your hand. Iâ€™m not gonna tell you why I would know that, but just trust me. I do findâ€¦ some of my friends know a lot about wine, but sometimes I think theyâ€™re situationally unaware. Like, I took my friend Lou to a really shitty lake dive bar in Tennessee. We get in and he goes, â€œSo, Kathleen, did you have a wine list?â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
â€œLou, look behind the bar. Look on the wall. You see what weâ€™re looking at?â€ I go, â€œThatâ€™s a stuffed squirrel playing a tiny banjo, Lou.â€ Yeah. Itâ€™s marvelous. I donâ€™t even know where you find that. Do you Google on Amazon a squirrel tiny banjo? I donâ€™tâ€¦ and then the person shellacked that and then they nailed that to driftwood and then they hung that as a full piece of art. And you know what? The guy who did that, Lou, does not have a wine list. I guarantee you that guy has a bottle of Jack Daniels and a carton of Marlboro Reds. And this is his idea of art. And I like it.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
A lot of people, as they get older, they just decide to quit drinking. Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, Iâ€™m not gonna quit.â€ I do find, though, the older I get, thereâ€™s stuff I wonâ€™t start that I might have when I was young. You know, people areâ€¦ itâ€™s usually physical things. â€œHey, do you wanna learn how to snow ski?â€ â€œUm, let me Google the deductibles on broken legs.â€ Oh, no. Iâ€™ll be at the bar at $16,000.â€ No. I did a corporate gig in Hawaii, which never happens and they were such a nice group. They were from Minnesota, this insurance company, and every day, the leader of the group would call my room to see if I wanted to do their activities. It was always going, â€œHey, Kathleen, thatâ€™s me, Bob from Minnesota.â€ â€œI know, Bob, you donâ€™t have to keep saying the Minnesota part. I got you because itâ€™s either you or the My Pillow Guy calling my room. And I donâ€™t know that man.â€ He goes, â€œWell, I just wanted to see if you wanted to join us for surf camp.â€ I said, â€œWell, I donâ€™t have my glasses on, but I think itâ€™s dark outside right now.â€ He goes, â€œYeah, itâ€™s dark, itâ€™s 5:30, but the sun comes up at 6:00 and weâ€™re gonna start surf camp at dawn.â€ I thought, â€œOh, I didnâ€™t say it.â€ [INDISTINCT] how fortunate for the sharks that all, all of these white walleyes from Minnesota are just gonna drop through their ceiling right in time for breakfast, be like pizzaâ€™s falling in here tonight. Weâ€™re like, â€œOh, my God, look, a pepperoni. This is crazy.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
But I didnâ€™t say that because I donâ€™t wanna be rude. And he goes, â€œWell, you know, just in case you are afraid, I wanna let you know now they have foam surfboards. So, if it does come back and hit you in the face, it doesnâ€™t break all your facial bones.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Youâ€™re still not selling me all this, Bob, because Iâ€™ll tell you this, Bob and I wasnâ€™t gonna bring it up, but since we keep talking about it on the way over here, I did think about snorkeling and I Googled, uh, shark attacks in the water surrounding Maui. And in the last six years or five, thereâ€™s been three fatalities. Now, that may not seem like a lot compared to the amount of people that are in the water every day, but it is a lot if you were one of those three because thatâ€™s it. The gameâ€™s over. Thatâ€™s it. Itâ€™s over. And I canâ€™t tell you how I am gonna die, Bob, but I can tell you how Iâ€™m not gonna die.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
And unless there is a great white shark bartending at that tiki hut, [CROWD LAUGHS] itâ€™s not going down like that, Bob.
[CROWD CHEERING]
And then whatâ€™s crazy if you put something like that into YouTube or Google, shark attacks in the water, oh, my God, seven million videos come up of horrifying things. And I donâ€™t know what made me click on the one. It was like a 60 Minutes or one of those shows. It was an old guy interviewing this young, cute girl, a surfer girl. But unfortunately, her right arm had been eaten off by a shark. And this was to be a feel-good thing because sheâ€™s gonna surf again and sheâ€™s sitting there with her parents and the old guy goes, â€œSo youâ€™re gonna to surf again, huh? Are you nervous? Because, well.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
So inappropriate, right? And theâ€¦ but the girl goes, â€œNo, because like I told my parents, what are the odds of a shark eating my other arm?â€ And her parents were just sitting there. I wanted to go, â€œTell her, the same, the exact Goddamn same. Whatâ€™s the matter with you?â€ And you know why theyâ€™re the same? Because sharks donâ€™t have Monday morning meetings about what has occurred and what will be occurring. â€œThis is Tiffany. Somebody ate her right arm off a year and a half ago. Sheâ€™s getting back in the water. Letâ€™s not eat her left arm off, too, okay? Donâ€™t be a dick, Bill. Everybody knows itâ€™s you. Thereâ€™s a lot of nice sharks in this room giving us a bad name.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
And Iâ€™ve watched Shark Week my whole life. Iâ€™m not getting in ever, ever again. Itâ€™s never, ever gonna happen. I like Shark Week and I really love the show. Iâ€™m very faithful to the show Snapped on Oxygen. Yeah, itâ€™s, itâ€™s like the only show they have anymore. Like, if you turn on the guide on Oxygen, it just says â€œSnap, Snap, Snap, Snap, Snap, Snap, Snap, Snap.â€ And if youâ€™ve never seen it, itâ€™s about women who have tolerated a whole lot of crap in their life. Bad crap. Until one day, they donâ€™t.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
And thatâ€™s the snap. And whatâ€™s crazy about this show is not only are the crimes usually off the charts crazy, but the women who did them, theyâ€™re on the show. Itâ€™s not actors. And they seem so extraordinarily normal. Like any lady youâ€™d meet in the suburbs. I know now nobodyâ€™s normal. And itâ€™s the way they tell the story. It sounds almost sweet when it starts. â€œHi. My nameâ€™s Sue. Uh, yeah, me, and, uh, me and Dave got married young. We were young. But a couple of years into the marriage, I found out he was having an affair, and I was just heartbroken. I was so upset. But he apologized and said he was drunk and I was young, so I stayed. Fast forward, a couple kids later, a few more years later, I find out heâ€™s having his second affair. And now Iâ€™m angry. I am. Iâ€™m angry because we have two little kids and this is their dad and they really like him. And again, I chose to stay. And then fast forward a few more years later, I found out he was having his third affair. And thatâ€™s when I set him on fire.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Yeah, I did. He was just laying there on that couch, passed out, and I thought, you know, Iâ€™ve asked him to move the gas cans in the garage at least 87 times. And I thought, you know, dammit, Iâ€™ll move them. You watch me. Iâ€™ll do it.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
And this is why when my friends in their 40s and 50s, they get divorced and then theyâ€™ll start dating and then theyâ€™ll always circle back around and go, â€œGoddamn, Kathleen, I had no idea how many women out there are crazy.â€ Well, you know what? Thatâ€™s your fault, because we have a whole channel devoted to what we are capable when the envelope gets pushed and itâ€™sâ€¦ you can watch it, too. Itâ€™s not just for women, but thatâ€™s the problem. You guys arenâ€™t watching it. You know whoâ€™s watching it? Other women. Weâ€™re just getting ideas. I know prison sentences. I know which states have the death penalty. You donâ€™t even know how much shit I know from that show. And whatâ€™s really alarming is my mom loves it, too. I would say weâ€™ve probably both been watching it for seven years and Iâ€™ve never seen a repeat. Oh, yeah [INDISTINCT] I like that. And I still watch Tiny House Hunters. Yeah, the other ones I got bored with. But Tiny, I like it because I feel like if you have never seen it, itâ€™s usually a couple. And I feel like theyâ€™re suffering some sort of clinical nervous breakdown, but nobody in their family or friends wanna deal with that shit, so everyone just encourages them. â€œYeah, you should live in a tiny house. You should leave right now. I donâ€™t even know why youâ€™re still here. Like, get going.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
The whole concept is that the tiny house is 500 square feet or less and theyâ€™ll all want it to be mobile, okay? Because theyâ€™re gonna tow this shit show all across North America and bother every single person theyâ€™ve ever met on Facebook. â€œHi, do you care if we live in a yard for like a year? Weâ€™ll be so quiet.â€ But with this show, whatâ€™s alarming is every time they pull up the couple to get their tiny house, theyâ€™re like in a 2015 Honda Civic. Well, come on, guys. You canâ€™t pull that with that. You canâ€™t even pull another Honda with that Honda. The tiny house you want is $47,000. The truck you need to pull that tiny house is $62,000. So, why donâ€™t we take your dumbasses truck shopping? And thatâ€™s why I will never be the host of Tiny House Hunters because it would turn into truck shopping, a show which I would have no interest in at all anyway, because as an adult, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything worse for me. Maybe aside from doing taxes is having to buy a car so much and I donâ€™t care what I drive. Up until last November, my car was a 2007 Mercury Mariner. Hold your applause.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Thereâ€™s more than just me. I see them out there. I loved it. But then it started acting weird. Iâ€™m like, â€œShit, Iâ€™m gonna go have to buy a car.â€ And my sister, whoâ€™s my height, important to this story, she drives a GMC Acadia. Iâ€™ve driven that. Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™ll do. Iâ€™ll just go get one of those.â€ So I called the GMC people. I go, â€œIâ€™m coming down there and Iâ€™m gonna pay cash and I donâ€™t wannaâ€¦ I donâ€™t wanna spend any more than an hour. I donâ€™t wanna talk about math or math or math. I donâ€™t wanna be in your play where you go talk to some secret person. I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™tâ€¦ Iâ€™m just gonna pay what you tell me it cost and then Iâ€™m going to leave it. Thisâ€™ll probably be the last car Iâ€™ll ever buy for all I know.â€ â€œOkay, sure. Come on down.â€ So I go down and Dave is my guy. I said, â€œDave, I truly donâ€™t give a shit. I donâ€™t even care what color it is. All I care about, Dave, one thing, my deal breaker, that seat has to go up electronically because it may not look like it, Dave, but I am actively shrinking in real time, like, itâ€™s a thing, Dave, like in five years, Iâ€™m gonna be in a car seat because for four-ten or under is the law.â€
[CROWD LAUGHS]
I said, â€œOther than that, I donâ€™t care.â€ And he goes, â€œWell, you know, you did say on the phone that you travel a lot. So I worked up some numbers about leasing.â€ No, donâ€™t do this, Dave. And he did it. He just started talking about math [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] â€¦la la la. And at some point, he noticed I had drifted out. [LAUGHS] And he goes, â€œKathleen, are you still with me?â€ â€œNo, Dave. I quit listening like eight minutes ago.â€ He goes, â€œWell, what are you thinking about? Maybe I can help you.â€ I go, â€œDo you really wanna know what I was thinking about, Dave? Honest to God, Iâ€™ll tell you what I was thinking about, because maybe you can help me because, um, I havenâ€™t figured it all out yet. Um, I just found out that in, like, the next, um, few months, Iâ€™m gonna haveâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna go to do shows in Portland, Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, and Medford, Oregon. And at night, me and the other comedian will drive, uh, to get to the other city and I was thinking about what I would do if we hit a Bigfoot.
[CROWD LAUGHS]
Yeah. [SIGHS] Because think about it, Dave. You know, with COVID, the animals are coming into town more and theyâ€™re more comfortable and itâ€™s worth millions and millions of dollars, Dave, thatâ€™s why you have to have a plan. Like, you canâ€™t just react emotionally in the moment or youâ€™re gonna lose all your money. So while you were talking, I figured thereâ€™s two scenarios, Dave. Scenario A is Iâ€™ve hit it and itâ€™s injured. Oh, not good, right? Itâ€™s stuck under the wheel well like [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] then how do I explain that, Dave? And so, I mean, Iâ€™m a wizard, but I only have so many powers. I canâ€™t be in charge of that. Scenario B, Dave, is Iâ€™ve hit it and itâ€™s dead. Thatâ€™s a lot more of a tame scenario. So, thatâ€™s the one I would hope for. But then you have to think, Dave, what are you gonna do? Like, are you gonna call the police?â€ â€œIâ€™m not because I donâ€™t trust the po-po. Theyâ€™ll steal my Bigfoot. I know they will. Itâ€™s worth millions and millions of dollars. Am I gonna post a picture on Instagram? No. Because then the millennials will get motivated and theyâ€™ll get up and theyâ€™ll come out there and beat me up and steal my Bigfoot because I will have forgotten to turn off my location. Am I gonna post it on TikTok? No, because most of my people are in a hospice and they donâ€™t need to be bothered with my horseshit. So thatâ€™s as far as I got, Dave. I donâ€™t know what I will do yet, but I know a lot of stuff I wonâ€™t do and thatâ€™s how you start a good plan for you.â€ He just looked at me with his eyes, theyâ€™re weird and where he goes, â€œSo the only thing you care about is if the seat goes up? â€œYes, Dave.â€
[LAUGHTER]
All right, you guys. I got to get out of here. Thank you so much, Denver. Youâ€™re always the best. Thank you.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you for coming.
I donâ€™t want to be negative, butâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦I donâ€™t think anythingâ€™s ever gonna get better ever again.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I donâ€™t wanna bum anybody out, but I think this is pretty much the way itâ€™s gonna be for however long it takes us to polish this planet off.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And donâ€™t misunderstand me, I have no hope.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I think if you have hope, what are you, fucking seven?
Soâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦again, I donâ€™t want to be negative, but you kinda know itâ€™s true, right?
In your heart, you know that itâ€™s fucking over, right?
I know itâ€™s hard to handleâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦culturally, politically, climate-wise.
What are you gonna do about the climate? Nothing.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I think in the back of our heads weâ€™re like, â€œWell, you know, I donâ€™t wanna get in the way of anything that Swedish teenagerâ€™s doing, you know?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Like, â€œGretaâ€™s got focus, sheâ€™s young, I think sheâ€™s gonna nail it.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And, look, I donâ€™t know. Iâ€¦ You know, I have moments where Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat can I do?â€ And then youâ€™re like, â€œWhat? Is that gnocchi?â€ You know, so, like itâ€™sâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Look, Iâ€™m doing a thing, that, uh, occasionally Iâ€™llâ€“
Well, yeah, Iâ€™ll do it now.
Just like, a lot of these ideas that Iâ€™m playing with, theyâ€™re hard to do, comedically.
So Iâ€™ve been working on a one-man show, sort of a serious one-man show, and I workshop it during the comedy act occasionally.
Iâ€™ll do it for you now.
Itâ€™s called Voices From the Future.
This is a multi-character one-person show where I play all the characters.
If you ever are like, you know, â€œWhereâ€™s Marc?â€ Itâ€™s still me, Iâ€™m here.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
So this is a one-person show, itâ€™s called Voices From the Future.
Itâ€™s just random people saying random things in the very near future.
The show right now is running about a minute and 30.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I picture that, when I produce it, itâ€™ll be in a small black box theater.
You know, itâ€™ll be dark and the lights will like, come up on each character, but Iâ€™ll just kinda mime that.
But youâ€™ll get it.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Some references are to the West Coast, but I think youâ€™ll get them and maybe Iâ€™ll throw one thatâ€™s-in thatâ€™s more appropriate to this coast.
Yeah, Iâ€™ll have to do a whole new character, but I think I can do it.
Right, so this is the first guy, Voices From the Future.
Okay, first guy, lights come up. â€œHow close are the fires?â€
Lights down.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
All right, thisâ€¦ (CHUCKLES) â€¦this is the second guy, lights up.
â€œWill the fifth booster work on the Zephyr strain? â€˜Cause I canâ€™t see out of this eye, doc. I canâ€™t see.â€ Lights down.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
All right, this is-This guy. All right, this isâ€“
Hold on, this guyâ€™s sad. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Okay.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Lights up.
â€œWhat, do you mean-You mean thereâ€™s no more water?â€
Bring the lights down.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Wait. All right, wait, thereâ€™s-Okay. So a East Coast one.
All right, this guyâ€™s a-All right.
All right. Okay, okay, here we go. (GROANS) Lights up.
â€œDo they have the floatable seating at the restaurant downtown?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Okay. Now, this last guyâ€“
So, if youâ€™re doing this at your community theater or, uh, your high schoolâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦uh, youâ€™d want to cast, like, a working-class guy for this last guy â€™cause heâ€™s kind of the comic relief at the end.
Okay. (GROANS) Lights up. â€œYou know, 130 is not that hot.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œOnce you get out in it, itâ€™s not that bad. Donâ€™t be a pussy and hydrate!â€
Thank you, Voices From the Future.
Appreciate it.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)
So, like, Iâ€™m trying to cover a lot of territory, or a lot of things in this first chunk of this show, and it gets a little heavy, but youâ€™ll be all right.
Umâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Thereâ€™s-I think we have a stupid people problem and Iâ€™m not saying that as a condescending person or a-Iâ€™m not a genius, but I kinda miss old-timey stupid.
You know, I miss back-in-the-day stupid.
I miss, like, ten-years-ago stupid.
You know, stupid that had a little humility, where you could say things like, â€œYouâ€™re kinda dumb,â€ and theyâ€™d be like, â€œYeah, I know.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWell, itâ€™s good you know that.â€
â€œWell, Iâ€™m not that dumb. I mean, come on!â€
â€œWell, good talk. Good luck with everything.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But now, thereâ€™s a new stupid, a brazen, sort of shameless, confident stupid.
Theyâ€™re just loaded up with all kinds of bullshit information.
It has a tone to it.
Iâ€™ll try to do a little of it for ya, the tone.
â€œOh, so, youâ€™re a scientist?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
And you canâ€™t pull that same thing you used to be able to pull with the old stupid.
You canâ€™t be like, â€œYouâ€™re kind of dumb.â€
â€˜Cause they go, â€œWhatâ€™s your source?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhat are you talking about?â€
â€œWhere are you getting your information?â€
â€œJust talking to you right now.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œYou gotta do your own research, bro.â€
â€œIâ€™m doing it in real timeâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦and I think my studyâ€™s almost concluded. And Iâ€™m stepping away slowly.â€
So now, weâ€™re just kinda half-waiting for the stupids to choose a uniform. Umâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
I donâ€™t know. Are you nervous?
Isnâ€™t it weird that, like, you know, you get your information one place and they get thereâ€™s another place.
Everyone gets it at different places, but thereâ€™s definitely a strain of stupid where you hear guys do, like, â€œYou know, you donâ€™t have to get any vaccines ever. I was listening to this podcast.â€
Most of the time thatâ€™s not going a good place.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI was with this podcast. You know, I was kinda in and out.â€
â€œButâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦Iâ€™m pretty sure the guy said that if you take a human growth hormone suppository and stick it up your ass hard until you get a boner, but itâ€™s not a gay boner â€™cause itâ€™s your finger, so why would it be gay?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œAnd I donâ€™t know if you know this, but thereâ€™s a man clit in your asshole that I found when I was watching UFC once. I was just poking around up there. And I told my bros about it, Iâ€™m like, â€˜Do you know about the man clit in your ass?â€™ So, they were like, â€˜What the fuck, dude?â€™ Iâ€™m like, â€˜All right, you live your life.â€™ Anywayâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦so when you get the boner, you stick it into a warm elkâ€™s heart, which you can order from the guyâ€™s website. Comes three in a package, frozen, and you just fuck it like a pocket pussy or a fleshlight. Itâ€™s not gay, itâ€™s an elkâ€™s heart. How would that be gay?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œAnd then you cum in it, and then you just throw it on a Traeger or whatever kinda grill you have. I have a Weber, but it doesnâ€™t matter and you cook it up and you, like, eat it on a sandwich orâ€“ Itâ€™s not gay to eat your own cum if itâ€™s cooked. Anywayâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦if you do that and you eat it, you donâ€™t have to get vaccinated for anything. Pretty sure thatâ€™s what the guy said. I was kinda in and out, was ordering supplements and, a new fleshlight and, you know, the uniforms are in, so I wanted to get a jump on that.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œAnd then I think the guy interviewed a professor of misogyny from Canada.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€œThat was really smart, man. He really knew what he was talking about. Someday when I have a woman, Iâ€™m gonna use some of it.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
And now, thereâ€™s all these comedians, like, â€œIâ€™m an anti-woke comic, man. Iâ€™m anti-woke and thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t get work.â€
â€œReally?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œYou think thatâ€™s the reason?â€ (CHUCKLES)
â€œYeah, man. We canâ€™t say anything anymore. Like, me and all the other anti-woke comedians, we all wanna say our version of the same three things. And you just canâ€™tâ€“â€œ
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œYou canâ€™t say anything anymore.â€
â€œNo, Iâ€™m pretty sure you can say whatever you want, really.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, you canâ€™t, man.â€
â€œYou can. There just may be consequences.â€
â€œSee, thatâ€™s the fucked up thing, the consequences.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWell, maybe when you get your uniform, you can make that the first order of business, is getting rid of the consequences.â€
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
(CHUCKLES)
â€œNo, man. Iâ€™m anti-woke.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Look, thereâ€™s problems. You know, I donâ€™t wannaâ€“ But I donâ€™t wanna say thereâ€™s a problem with Christian fascism, butâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦there might be a problem. And Iâ€™m not saying youâ€™re all in on it, if youâ€™re Christians, but, you know, you kinda are. Right?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Like, if you really think a flying Jew is gonna come backâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€¦and make everything okay, isnâ€™t that, like, mental illness?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
I donâ€™t wanna make anyone uncomfortable â€™cause I know, a lot of you know that we haveâ€“
You know, as Iâ€™m speaking, and I guess I should make it clear that we have found recently that there is actually something that brings most people together, itâ€™s antisemitism.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Andâ€¦ (CLICKS TONGUE) â€¦yeah.
Iâ€™m saying that as a Jew, and as a Jew, Iâ€™m saying that we will replace you.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s happening, weâ€™re all part of it. Weâ€™re doing it, weâ€™re all doing our bit. You-Thereâ€™s an app now we can replace you with.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And itâ€™s a commission thing. How-We get a certain kickback for the number of you replaced. I talked to my brother last week, he replaced, like, 76 last week. And every quarter, we get a check from Global Control HQ.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Itâ€™s got the cool logo with the planet and the Star of David and gold leaf around it, signed by George Soros.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Itâ€™s kinda cool, itâ€™s almost frameable, but we cash them. Soâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And I donâ€™t know, like, Iâ€™m not religious, Iâ€™m a Jew, soâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
And thereâ€™s a difference between Jews and Christians, obviously, I mean, I think if the relationship with God is different, if you look at the testaments, the Old Testament. It seemed like the relationship with Jews and God was basically, â€œWhat?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhat do you want me to do? Now? All right, all right. Donâ€™t yell, donâ€™t yell.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Whereas I think the Christian relationship is more likeâ€¦ (WHIMPERS)
Soâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But thereâ€™s not a racket. I donâ€™t see the Jew thing as a racket. The Christian thing I see as a racket. Itâ€™s almost like, you know, â€œHereâ€™s the New Testament, make it your own and grift as you will.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Right? I mean, and thereâ€™s a pitch to it.
thatâ€™s kinda genius.
And if you really break it down, the pitch is basically, â€œEverything will be amazing when youâ€™re dead.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œPut some money in the jar.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But, look, the real problem right now with, uh, you knowâ€¦
Christian fascismâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦is that, you know, Roe v. Wade was taken down.
Women, all women in this country have lost their physical autonomy and their rights and the weird thing is, I donâ€™t hear men talking about it.
I hear no men talking about it.
Which is unusual to me because if youâ€™re a guy with any game at all, youâ€™ve paid for at least two of those.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
So you had something to say at some point in time.
I think most men are pro-choice, usually desperately.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œBaby, itâ€™s up to you. Itâ€™s your choice, but not a great time, right?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI mean, for either of us, itâ€™s just not a good time. I mean, fuck, right? Fuck! No, Iâ€™m not mad at you, itâ€™s just my whole fucking life! Iâ€™m not crying, just do what you want! Iâ€™ll pay for it. Iâ€™ll drive you down there. Iâ€™ll take you to the place. We can get pancakes at that place you like.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Or the entertainerâ€™s version, â€œIâ€™ll fly back into town, just tell me the day!â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Itâ€™s hard to talk to people of faith about abortion if they have the whole murder frame in place.
If itâ€™s murder to somebody, thereâ€™s really no conversation.
Thereâ€™s no way to bridge it. You canâ€™t do the, like, â€œNo, itâ€™s just cluster of cells, not unlike a tumor. Itâ€™s justâ€¦ going a different direction, you know?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES) â€œWith the same result sometimes, itâ€™s just a longer game, really.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But a lot of it has to do with the language of choice which isâ€¦ itâ€™s practical, itâ€™s medical.
You know, abortion, abortion clinic.
Easy to demonize, scary.
Like, if we shifted some of the language, we might be able to bridge a gap and have a conversation with people of faith. Maybe justâ€“
Maybe we call them angel factories.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
I mean, that would be at least a conversation starter, right?
I didnâ€™t-I donâ€™t-I didnâ€™t say abortion clinic.
I said an angel factory.
And how if the concern is getting souls to heaven, we need more of them, we need more.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Nowâ€¦
Christians have corrected me on this.
One guy who wrote me an email.
It was a fairly heady email. It had two levels to it.
The first level was, â€œThe number of angels is finite.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œDead children do not become angels, theyâ€™re separate things. Thereâ€™s only a given number of angels, good and bad. So you were wrong there.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
And the other thing was, â€œIf a soul needs-is gonna go to heaven, it needs to be baptized.â€
So, Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right, well thereâ€™s-Thatâ€™sâ€“ We can troubleshoot around that.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Right?
I mean, thereâ€™s a lot of priests around with a lot of free time, and historically, thatâ€™s not a great thing.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But I say get the priests out in front of the angel factories with the water and the, whatever the kind of Latin hokum they need to do the little dance around.
And just do it for each woman coming in and then, boom!
Guaranteed soul right up to heaven, every time.
And I think that the vibe outside an angel factory with the Christians hanging out will be different than those at the abortion clinic. I think itâ€™d be more festive.
Just likeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Just standing around watching the counter on the side of the building.
Maybe thereâ€™s a bell on top of it.
Bing! â€œHallelujah! Praise Jesus. When the bell rings, an angel gets its wings. We are blessed today. We are blessed. Thank you, lady. Put a little money in the jar. Youâ€™re not off the hook.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CLICKS TONGUE) So, okay.
I know itâ€™s a lot to get through, especially from a Jew.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES) I donâ€™t know why I do this.
I donâ€™t know why every show, thereâ€™s part of me, that just wants to keep poking the Jew thingâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦just so people who think they donâ€™t have anything against Jews, under their breath says, â€œWe fucking get it, man.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
(CHUCKLES) I just want you to find that part of you.
(SIGHS) All right. Soâ€¦ (CHUCKLES)
â€¦Iâ€™m getting old. Iâ€™m 59. Itâ€™s not really old, but itâ€™s ol-Iâ€™m in aâ€“
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
Yeah, whatever. Iâ€™m in aâ€¦
Itâ€™s no victory. (CHUCKLES) Just luck.
So-But itâ€™s weird, you get to a certain age where like, like almost every night, right before I go to sleep, Iâ€™m like, â€œIs this it?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Right? And then the next thought is always like, â€œI gotta get rid of some shit.â€ (CHUCKLES)
â€œI got too much shit, man.â€
But I donâ€™t always know that Iâ€™m getting older.
I donâ€™t always feel it because I think itâ€™s a few reasons, â€™cause I donâ€™t have kids.
I think if you have kids, you can kinda see youâ€™re dying in your kids.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I mean, maybe thatâ€™s cynical and I donâ€™t really know, but I have to imagine at some point youâ€™re like, â€œHappy birthday, son. How old are you today? Seventeen? Fuck, Iâ€™m dying.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œIâ€™m sorry. I meant to say have fun today. I donâ€™t know. I guess I was thinking out loud a little bit.â€
Mirrors donâ€™t really help.
I mean, they do, but that you canâ€™t trust them.
You have a relationship with your mirror.
Itâ€™s the same thing you look at every day.
You have a codependent relationship with the mirror that you look in every day where you gaslight yourself into believing that youâ€™re hanging in there.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I donâ€™t know what your ritual is, but itâ€™s probably something along the lines ofâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
And then you walk out into the world totally deludedâ€¦ that you look the age you think you look.
The only time I know how Iâ€™m getting old, or that I am getting old, is when I look at pictures of myself.
Then itâ€™s-Itâ€™s somehow, itâ€™s clearer to me â€™cause itâ€™s separate.
And I look at pictures and Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, my God, look at my old head! Look at my old, big head! When did my head get big and old?â€
And it did, and thereâ€™s nothing you can do under your head thatâ€™s gonna diminish from your old head.
No matter how you dress. Everyoneâ€“
People are gonna be like, â€œCool boots, old head though, right?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œYes, it is an old head. Itâ€™s an old, honest head. I do nothing to it.â€
I canâ€™t dye my hair. Who the hellâ€“
How can you dye your hair in your mid fifties as a dude and just-What, you just expect everyone in your life to play along with that decision, likeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
You just show up one day and everyoneâ€™s like, â€œOh, fuck, I guess thatâ€™s who he is now.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhat do you think, man? You think-Does it look good?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are you going for, Dracula? If youâ€™re going for Dracula, you nailed it.â€
â€œI did it myself.â€ â€œI can tell, you dyed your scalp.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Think itâ€™s a little late to go through a goth period, donâ€™t you? Am I wrong?
And I think about what kind of old guy Iâ€™m gonna be.
I donâ€™t know, like, you know, Iâ€™m approaching it, but, like, I know guys in their eighties.
Like, and Iâ€™ve decided that thereâ€™s like two kinds of old guys in their eighties.
Like, thereâ€™s the kinda guy that no matter what kinda life he had, you know, heâ€™s got some humility, he knows where heâ€™s at in his life.
You know, heâ€™s got a certain amount of acceptance, you know, the kinda guy thatâ€™s like, â€œYeah, you know, life was hard, but, you know, it was up and down. But Iâ€™m just happy to have another day. Iâ€™m grateful, and Iâ€™m just gonna sit here and watch the water.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Right? That guy.
And then thereâ€™s the other guy in his eighties that no matter what kind of life he had, in his mind, he got fucked somehow.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œThe whole thing was bullshit. It was all bullshit. No money left. No fucking money. Two ex-wives. No money. One of my kids doesnâ€™t talk to me. The one that does is a moron.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œFuck the whole thing, it was bullshit. Just gonna sit here and watch this asshole, watch the water.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€œMy best friend here, the water watcher. Not mad at this guy.â€
â€œNot today, youâ€™re not, but yesterdayâ€“â€œ
â€œShut up. Donâ€™t talk.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
MARC MARON: I have old guys in my life. My dadâ€™s still alive. My dad is 84 years old.
Donâ€™t. No. Donâ€™t.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
I get-Donâ€™t. Hold your applauseâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦â€™cause I have to preface this material byâ€¦ with some honesty. My-For most of my life, my father was very self-centered.
He had bipolar, emotionally abusive, narcissistic fuck.
Now, the only reason Iâ€™m telling you that is because I donâ€™t want you to have the wrong amount of empathyâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦when I do these next few jokes. I donâ€™t want you, I donâ€™t want you rooting for the wrong guy.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
My fatherâ€™s 84, recently diagnosed with dementia.
Weâ€™re all pretty excited.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Everyoneâ€™s dealing with this, everyoneâ€™s dealing with this.
And I gotta be honest with you, heâ€™s right at the beginning, so heâ€™s still got almost all his old memories.
Day of stuffâ€™s a little tricky. But to be honest, heâ€™s very pleasant to be around right now.
Heâ€™s open, heâ€™s kinda funny. Heâ€™s warm.
Look, I guess what Iâ€™m saying is, I know itâ€™s a terrible disease, but donâ€™t miss the sweet spot. Itâ€™sâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦I think itâ€™s right at the beginning.
Itâ€™s just lovely. It really is just lovely.
Iâ€™ll just walk up to him and be like, â€œHow you doing, Dad? How you doing?â€
I rub his little head.
People get uncomfortable when they think of me rubbing my dadâ€™s head.
What am I supposed to be doing?
â€œWhatâ€™s my name?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhere do you live? Do you know where you live? What day is today?â€
Thatâ€™s what theyâ€™ve earned at 84 is for you to selfishly yell at them thinking it helps as they look at you confused and crying.
But Iâ€™m showing up for him, which is interesting, you know, because we did have a difficult relationship and itâ€™s kinda nice to live to be my age and have your parents alive, because, look, Iâ€™m one of those people.
I have a hard time when people my age say, â€œArenâ€™t you a little old to still be mad at your parents?â€
â€œNo.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œThey did it.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(APPLAUDING, CHEERING)
(CHUCKLES) I love my audience because I just know thereâ€™s a room full of people that were-They only had maybe one good parent.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Maybe. So itâ€™s a big room full of broken toys in here.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
(CHUCKLES)
Every day is a fucking challenge and youâ€™re overly sensitive and justâ€¦ (CHUCKLES) â€¦battling dread all the time and wondering if youâ€™re talented.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Soâ€¦ So, my dad, so, heâ€™s like-Okay, so, hereâ€™s the thing.
Iâ€™m like, Iâ€™m showing up for the guy, like I said before.
And it is weird, but something gives way, no matter how difficult the relationship was between you and that parent or both of them.
Like, you get old enough, and, you know, in your mind, youâ€™re sort of like, â€œI kind of won.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
So, Iâ€™m gonna go out there, you know?
But I go out there to hang out with him.
You know, the dementia is new to him, itâ€™s new to me.
I donâ€™t know his life that well.
And Iâ€™ll take him out to this Chinese place.
The last time I was there, we go to the Chinese place and I order, you know, soup and some entrÃ©es.
And weâ€™re just sitting there, me and my dad, just sitting there, and he just picks up his soup spoon and he fills it with soy sauce.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And heâ€™s looking right at me, right in my face. (SLURPS)
And he just sucks the spoonful of soy sauce down.
And my only thought in that moment was, â€œI didnâ€™t know my dad did that.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI really havenâ€™t gone out to Chinese with him in a long time, I guess.â€
You know. Thatâ€™s wild. Right out of the spoon.
Yeah, I watched him fill it up again. He filled it up again.
Heâ€™s looking right at me. (SLURPS)
And I said, â€œIs that good?â€ And he said, â€œI like it.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
He did it three timesâ€¦ before my brain was like, â€œHe has dementia. Take the spoon away from him, or heâ€™ll drink all the soy sauce one spoonful at a time.â€
So I put the spoon down.
â€œDad, weâ€™re gonna have food coming.â€
And heâ€™s like, â€œAll right. Now, there he is.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Every time I do that to his head, heâ€™s likeâ€¦ (CHUCKLES)
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And, look, I know. (SIGHS) I know itâ€™s a terrible disease andâ€¦ you know, and at some point, heâ€™sâ€“ heâ€™s not going to know who I am anymore. I know that. (CLICKS TONGUE) And I also know, on that day, I will be truly free.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œHey, Dad, how you feeling?â€
â€œWho the fuck are you?â€
â€œYes! Itâ€™s over.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œThe most toxic relationship of my life just ended, buddy, just ended.â€
â€œWho the fuck are you?â€
â€œDoesnâ€™t matter. Doesnâ€™t matter. I thought I knew you. My bad. My bad.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)
So I have this other old man in my life.
My mother is still alive. But I canâ€™tâ€“ Iâ€™m going to go easy on her because sheâ€™s still, you know, cognizant.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Itâ€™s not great. But sheâ€™s got this boyfriend. Do you still call him a boyfriend when theyâ€™re 85?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The guy whoâ€™s fucking my mother is 85 years old andâ€¦ I should be nothing but grateful that heâ€™s fucking my mother. I should thank God every day that John is fucking my mother. Right. Itâ€™s great. Takes a load off of me.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
In a metaphorical way.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But Johnâ€™s difficult. And itâ€™s not â€™cause heâ€™s fucking my mother. I mean, like, Iâ€™m 59. Heâ€™s 85. Is there a point where you grow past that sort of like, â€œWhy are you fucking this guy, Ma?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But theyâ€™ve been together a long time. Heâ€™s just annoying, you know? And I try to be tolerant. But heâ€™s one of these old guys that, you knowâ€¦ (CHUCKLES) He just talks. He talks a lot. He thinks heâ€™s telling stories, but heâ€™s not really. They donâ€™t go anywhere. They donâ€™t land. You donâ€™t even know theyâ€™re over, you know, until he wistfully says, â€œIt was a different time.â€ You know?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And itâ€™s annoying, you know?
Like, Iâ€™ll go over there and heâ€™ll be like, â€œMarc. Marc, come here. Let me tell you something.â€
â€œWhat?â€ â€œListen.â€ â€œOkay?â€ â€œWhen I was younger, we used to go to the delicatessen, maybe have a sandwich, some coffee, talk a little bit. It was a different time.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œIs that the whole thing? Thatâ€™s the whole story?â€
â€œWhy you got to be a wiseass?â€ â€œItâ€™s just not a story. I mean, there was probably a story in there. You know, what deli? Who were you talking to? What kind of sandwich? A lot of options. You chose none of them. Zero.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI canâ€™t talk to you.â€
â€œGood. Donâ€™t fucking talk to me orâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦get some sort of narrative arc going. Flesh it out a little bit. Land it. Land it.â€
(CLICKS TONGUE)
â€œMarc. Come here, let me tell you something.â€
â€œWhat? What is it?â€
â€œListen.â€
â€œOkay?â€
â€œWhen I was younger.â€
â€œYeah?â€
â€œWe used to go out maybe on a Saturday night with the ladies, to a show. Always shined my shoes. Always. Different time.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œNot a story, again, not a story.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhy you got to be a wiseass?â€
â€œIâ€™m just saying, there was a story in there? What show? What ladies? What year? The type of shoe would be a nice detail.â€
â€œMaybe thatâ€™s just me.â€ â€œI canâ€™t talk to you.â€
â€œGood. Donâ€™t fucking talk to me. Do me a favor.â€
â€œMarc.â€
â€œWhat?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œListen.â€
â€œWhat? What is it?â€
â€œNew York City.â€
â€œOkay, yeah?â€
â€œItâ€™s raining outside.â€
â€œOkay.â€
â€œDifferent time.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€œWait, are these poems? These are poems. I thought youâ€™re trying to tell stories, but these are actually poems and theyâ€™re kind of good. Youâ€™re kind of an amazing poet. Maybe we should self-publish an anthology of your poetry. And just call it, It Was a Different Time: The Poems. Like, I could blurb it for you. Quote, â€˜These little bits and pieces of his life are just vague enough to make you wonder what it was like to be him during the times he doesnâ€™t really tell you aboutâ€¦â€™ â€œ
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦unquote. Marc Maron, stand up-comic, podcaster, his girlfriendâ€™s son.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
MARC: But the point I was trying to make is that the mortality thing, the idea of impending death, which is, you know, pretty much going to happen. To everyone.
Itâ€™s right there.
And I know a lot of you know me and you know my life â€™cause you listen to me all the time. And you know that during COVID, my partner, my girlfriend, Lynn Shelton, the director, the genius passed away. She didnâ€™t get COVID.
Thank you, Iâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Iâ€™m assuming thatâ€™s applaud of recognition.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)
â€œThank God, sheâ€™s gone. Jesus.â€
Soâ€¦ (SHUSHES) Take it easy.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Itâ€™ll be okay.
I can get right back into the sad tone. But she did. She passed away. And it was the most horrible thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me. And Iâ€™m sure to her. Andâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
It was right there.
But let me get serious. You know, she did die and it was a terrible tragedy. And the truth is, like, Iâ€™m a guy who talks about his life. So I wasnâ€™t clear how that was gonna go. How am I going to talk about that? You know, â€œIs that ever going to happen? Is there a way to bring humor to that?â€ Because Iâ€™m not really the kind of guy thatâ€™s like, â€œSheâ€™s dead, what are the bits? Letâ€™s get going.â€ You know?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But there was also moments where Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, maybe I canâ€™t do it. Maybe I have to do something more serious. Maybe I have to do maybe a Jewish themed one-man show, you know, maybe, like, Marc Maronâ€™s Kaddish: A Prayer for the Dead,â€ you know, sort of a black box theater. You know, before the show, thereâ€™s like Israeli music playing, you know. (VOCALIZES) And then the lights come up and I just lean into it.
(IN HEBREW) â™ª Yis-gadal, vâ€™yis-kadash! â™ª
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
People would walk out of that show going,
â€œDefinitely wasnâ€™t funny, wasnâ€™t funny at all.
And I like him. Heâ€™s funny. But this was very sad.
But Iâ€™m glad he did it.
He seemed to, like, really work through some stuff.
But not one laugh. Not one laugh.
And Iâ€™m not Jewish, so I missed half the references.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But then I thought, â€œWell, maybe how about a TED talk? People do TED talks. I could do a TED talk. How hard is a fucking TED talk? I just have to get one of those weird, you know, earphone, microphones. You know, change my posture a little bit.â€
You know, like, â€œEveryone dies.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€œIâ€™m gonna die. Youâ€™re going to die. We all die. Iâ€™m Marc Maron. Iâ€™m a comedian.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But then, ultimately, what happens is I realize, well, youâ€™re just going to talk about it.
You know, somehow or another, you figured out youâ€™re gonna talk about it and if, you know, you need to talk about it in a funny way, it will happen at some point if itâ€™s necessary, which it always is.
But, like, I realize, you know, and thinking about it that, you know, no one really talks about grief.
No one talks about PTSD.
No one knows how to process this stuff.
Everybody has it. Itâ€™s just, you know, locked into us.
And thereâ€™s not a conversation.
Thereâ€™s not really a cultural conversation around it. And itâ€™s difficult. You know, when she died, the only things that really kind of stuck in my head was that Iâ€™m not the victim, you know, she is.
And itâ€™s horrible.
And, you know, this is not unusual.
People die in peopleâ€™s lives. Tragedy happens.
You hope it doesnâ€™t happen to you, but it happens to probably most people.
And then the Jewish thing, you know, â€œMay her memory be a blessing.â€
These sort of, you know, kept me going.
And it was a difficult time to grieve because it was COVID, so, you know, no one could really come by.
People reached out, but there was not a lot of, you know, human contact, and I guessâ€“
Iâ€™d be honest with you, I got very tired of crying in front of strangers, my neighbors.
â€˜Cause I didnâ€™t know them. And it was in the paper.
And this is how I met my neighbors.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
You know, and grief is a fucked up thing.
You know, I remember, like, a week after she died, I was just taking my garbage out and from across the street, I hear, â€œHey, Marc, Iâ€™m Troy. I live across the street. How are you doing, man?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œNot good, dude! Itâ€™s not good.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, I bet, buddy. I bet.â€
â€œItâ€™s fucking terrible.â€ â€œI bet, man. Well, Iâ€™m just across the street.â€
â€œI know, man. I see you. Youâ€™re right there.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And he just stood there until I stopped crying. And I was like, â€œThanks, man.â€
Thatâ€™s-I feel better, buddy. I feel better.â€
â€œNice meeting you, dude.â€
It was that moment where I realized, like, it doesnâ€™t take much to show up for somebody in grief.
And a lot of us, when it happens in our lives, youâ€™re like, â€œWhat do I do? What do I say?â€
You donâ€™t have to say anything. You barely have to show up.
You donâ€™t even have to invest emotionally.
You just have to be like, â€œHow you doing?â€
Wait till they stop crying and go like, â€œOkay.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And theyâ€™ll think youâ€™re the greatest person in the world. Like, â€œYou really showed up for me when I was grieving.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œReally? Oh, yeah. Okay.â€
Soâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But it was just weird because, you know, it was COVID.
And, you know, I just sit on my porch and people I knew would come over and they stand in the yard, you know, with their mask on.
I felt like a zoo exhibit.
There shouldâ€™ve just been a sign that said, â€œGrieving Man.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And I would just sit there and people would show up, theyâ€™d be like, â€œHow are you doing?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œNot great.â€
â€œWe brought food.â€
â€œSlide it into the cage.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œOh, bagels. I like bagels. Grieving Man feeding time.â€ (CHOMPS)
People wanna help you. You want to be helped.
You want to feel better. You want it to go away.
But it doesnâ€™t, because it happened.
And you realize over time that itâ€™ll never go away.
But people want to help and you want to feel better.
If you have smart friends, youâ€™ll get, like, six copies of the Joan Didion book.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
It seems like thereâ€™s a group of people that as soon as someone dies, man, The Year of Magical Thinking goes out.
And you read it â€™cause you want to feel better.
And youâ€™re like, â€œAll right. So her husband died, too. Didnâ€™t really help me.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But if youâ€™re a creative person, it adds another level of despair â€™cause youâ€™re like, â€œFuck, do I need to start writing now?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
People tell you things that they want, they think will make you feel better. like, I remember someone told me, I canâ€™t remember who it was.
They said, â€œHey, man, you know, when people die, they donâ€™t really leave.
You know, their energy is still here.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œHow is that helpful?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI got used to her in a human form.â€
And this person was like, â€œYeah, but just think about it, man, everyone whoâ€™s ever died, their energy is still here.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But oddly, you know, when youâ€™re fucking sad, youâ€™ll go mystical.
You need it.
A couple of days after that guy told me that, Iâ€™m just sitting on my porch and a hummingbird came right up to my head, just likeâ€¦ (IMITATES BUZZING)
Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, my God! Lynn! Lynn, youâ€™re a hummingbird now. Of course, you are. That makes so much sense.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€œI miss you, baby. I canâ€™t believe youâ€™re a hummingbird. Whatâ€™s that like? Thatâ€™s crazy.â€
And then the next day there were, like, four hummingbirds and Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuck is happening?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhich one is Lynn? Whoâ€™s Lynn? Is this, like, Lynn and her new dead friends? This is what happens when people die. They just become birds of one kind or another. Thatâ€™s going to disappoint some Christians.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(MARC CLICKS TONGUE, CHUCKLES)
â€œEverything will be amazing when youâ€™re a bird.â€
(CHUCKLES)
â€œPut the money in the jar.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But the bird thing kind of stuck because, like, at some point, like, a bird, you know, built a nest right above where I walk into my house and they just shit so much.
Itâ€™s, like, astounding.
If you really just take a minute to think, like, â€œHow much do birds shit?â€ Itâ€™s a lot.
And I have to be careful walking into my house because the bird was shitting, and at some point I said, â€œHey, baby, Iâ€™m not going to forget you. Is there a different wayâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦that we can do this? You know, I still have the hat and stuff, andâ€¦ the shit thingâ€™s kind of tired, I think.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But, look, I miss her and itâ€™s weird when you lose somebody because it really, you know, it wakes you up to someâ€¦
To who you are really, and also how fragile life is.
You know, maybe love will happen again.
I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m not that great at it.
I justâ€¦ (CHUCKLES) I come from very selfish stock, and I donâ€™t have the tools necessary to really be as open as Iâ€™d like.
But who knows? It might happen. I might find love again.
And maybe Iâ€™ll be sleeping with a person I love, having love sex as opposed to the other kind.
Equally as good.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But maybe Iâ€™m having love sex and, you know, itâ€™s beautiful and the woman Iâ€™m having sex with kind of looks over my shoulder and she says, â€œWhy is that hummingbird just hovering out there?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, thatâ€™s my old girlfriend. She just-I donâ€™t know. She just likes to be part of it sometimes.â€
â€œYou cool with that?â€ â€œIs she with her friends?â€
â€œUsually thereâ€™s four of them andâ€¦ itâ€™s fucking out of control.â€
I did wonder, like, would I ever be able to be funny about things?
But I find that, like, you know, humor that comes from real darkness is really the best because it disarms it.
Itâ€™s elevating to the spirit. Itâ€™s why I got into comedy, because I would watch comics and they would take things that were complicated or horrifying and simplify them and sort of make you see them in a different way and have a laugh.
And I think itâ€™s a beautiful thing.
And necessary, like, I believe there was probably, some hilarious people in Auschwitz.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I mean, come on. It was, like, all Jews. Are you going to tell meâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€¦are you going to tell me there wasnâ€™t one guy where the other Jews are like, â€œAre you going to watch Murray tonight? Itâ€™s crazy. Heâ€™s hilarious. He does all the Nazis. Itâ€™s hilarious.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Of course, there was.
Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s, like, an Auschwitz joke book written by Jews that no one knows how to publish.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhat are we going to call it? The Auschwitz Joke Book by Jews.â€
â€œItâ€™s not happening. We canâ€™t.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œItâ€™ll be misunderstood. We canâ€™t.â€
But I do remember the first, you know, joke that came to me about Lynnâ€™s passing that made me feel better. And Iâ€™ll share it with you. The setup is heavy. And if youâ€™re-ifâ€¦ The fact that youâ€™re going to die is triggering to you, you might want to leave for a few minutes.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
All right. Soâ€¦ this is a day that a lot of people have had. Itâ€™s when you have a loved one in the hospital whoâ€™s fighting for their life. Itâ€™s a horrible day. Donâ€™t wish it on anybody. Itâ€™s the worst day of your life. Youâ€™re on the phone with doctors, with friends, with family members, trying to hold on to hope, trying to get information, trying to figure out a way to stay positive.
You know, and at some point, you know, it turns and itâ€™s not going to work out the way that you want it to work out.
And about 5:30, 6:30 in the afternoon, you know, the doctor says to me, he says, â€œLook, you can come down here and see her if you want.â€
This is peak COVID, no oneâ€™s in hospitals.
â€œSheâ€™s probably going to be gone. Weâ€™re taking her off the machines, but you can come down here and see her.â€
And I was likeâ€¦ (EXHALES) â€œWhat? Do-What do you mean? Do people even do that?â€
And heâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know what people do. Iâ€™m just telling you I can make that happen.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know what to do. I gotta, you know, I gotta call, like, 12 people to figure out what to do.â€
So I start calling people and Iâ€™m like, â€œDude, the doctor just said that I can go see her and sheâ€™s going to be dead.â€
And theyâ€™re like, â€œThatâ€™s fucked up.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s not helpful.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
So I went through about nine of those. And finally, I called Michaela Watkins, whoâ€™s a friend of both of ours, great actress. And I go, â€œMichaela, the doctor says I can come see her, but sheâ€™s going to be dead.â€
And Michaela just goes, â€œOh, you have to do that.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t. It sounds terrible.â€
She goes, â€œYou would regret not doing that.â€
And I thought, like, â€œYou donâ€™t really know me, apparently, because it sounds like the worst thing I could ever do in my life.â€
And she said, â€œWell, itâ€™s never going to happen again, and it might be good to do it because thereâ€™s going to be closure there and you donâ€™t really know how it will feel. And itâ€™s an important thing to do. Itâ€™s an opportunity.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, okay. Fuck.â€
So I call the doctor back and Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right, Iâ€™m in, Iâ€™m coming down.â€
And heâ€™s like, â€œAll right, well, I gotta give you a heads up. We canâ€™t really clean up because the coroner has to sign off on her.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re not really selling this. I gotta be honest with you.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI donâ€™t know if I can handle it, man.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œYou can handle it. Just come down here and weâ€™ll take care of you.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, all right.â€ So, now, itâ€™s 12:30 at night, Iâ€™m driving down to the hospital and Iâ€™m in shock. My girlfriend died. You know, out of body experience. Iâ€™m shattered and totally traumatized. And Iâ€™m driving alone to this hospital in the middle of the night.
And I get to the hospital and thereâ€™s no one in it, just a security guard. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m here.â€
He says, â€œYeah, I know.â€
And he takes me up to intensive care. Now, like, thank God for nurses. Theyâ€™re real heroes and theyâ€™re at this shit. Yeah.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
Every day. Every day, nurses are dealing with this stuff. And Iâ€™m saying that to preface the fact that the nurses up in the ICU were a little chipper. I donâ€™t know why. Butâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Maybe it was helpful. I donâ€™t know. But I got up there and Iâ€™m like, â€œHi.â€
And theyâ€™re like, â€œHi!â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œRe-Okay.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And Iâ€™m like, â€œYou know, Iâ€™m here to see Lynn Shelton.â€
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWe know, sheâ€™s just in there.â€
And thereâ€™s no rooms in an ICU. Not at this one. It was dark and there was just curtains. And they said, â€œSheâ€™s in there. You know, you go in there and, you know, take as much time as you want.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay.â€
So I walk in there and Lynnâ€™s there and sheâ€™s gone. And I was able to, you know, touch her forehead and, you know, tell her I loved her and cry, you know, for a few minutes. And I stayed with her for a good five minutes, and I was like, you know, I felt like, â€œOkay, Iâ€™m going to go,â€ you know, and I said goodbye and Iâ€™m walking out and Iâ€™m thinking, â€œSelfie? No. Right?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
(MARC MUMBLES)
Nowâ€¦
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
â€¦when I wrote that joke or when I came up with it, it made me feel so happy.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But I didnâ€™t know what to do with it, you know, so I call the darkest comic I know, Dan Vitale, whoâ€™s since passed. And I said-I told the joke. And heâ€™s like, â€œOh, my God, thatâ€™s amazing. But you can never tell that.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know, man. Weâ€™ll see.â€
I think-And I think Lynn would like it, you know, and I held on to that, you know, until I got to Ireland recently. And now, itâ€™s become unclear.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I was doing that bit in Ireland, and her and I had a vacation there. It was the only vacation we had taken and we had an amazing time. We both had a deep sort of love for Ireland for whatever reason, because itâ€™s amazing. Butâ€“ So Iâ€™m in Dublin doing a show recently and I do that bit and the lights in the venue started going on and off. The lights on me started wavering. And everyone in the room was like, â€œOh, my God.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œTake it easy. Hi, Lynn. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re in Ireland and you love it here. You good?â€
And then it was like, â€œOkay.â€ And I didâ€“ And I took it as a sign that, â€œOkay, she likes the jokes.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Wait. But wait. So then I get back to my hotel room and the venue manager said, â€œThatâ€™s never happened before.â€
â€œNo, it was Lynn, sheâ€™s hanging out.â€
So-â€œUsually sheâ€™s a bird.â€
Soâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But I get back to my hotel room in Ireland and I go to turn the lamp on and the bulb goesâ€¦ (IMITATES CRACKLING) It just doesnâ€™t-It goes out. And Iâ€™m like, â€œShit. Whatâ€™s up, baby?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But Iâ€™m still holding on to the idea that, â€œNo, she likes the jokes. Right?â€
When youâ€™re sad, youâ€™ll go mystical.
So I do them in Texas a few months later and during that bit the mic starts going in and out and Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, shit, she came to Texas.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES) â€œMaybe she doesnâ€™t like the jokes.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But I thought if it happens at the HBO taping, Iâ€™m definitely never doing them again.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)
Butâ€¦
Look. I-She was, you know, a big supporter of mine, and I loved her and I miss her. So, rest in peace, Lynn Shelton.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
You know, Iâ€™mâ€“ You know, I do try to focus on gratitude to some degree when I can, and I have no kids. And itâ€™s amazing.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
It really is. Itâ€™s-I canâ€™t even begin to tell you, if you have them whatâ€“ well, how amazing it would have been if you didnâ€™t.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
(CLICKS TONGUE) And I think even ten years ago, a 59-year-old man on stage saying he didnâ€™t have kids, a lot of people would be like, â€œAw,â€ but I think that paradigm is shifting a little bit.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I think there are people that are like, â€œOh, God, good for you. Jesus, what a mistake.â€
I donâ€™t know why people have them. I have nothing against them. But it really seems that people donâ€™t know that they donâ€™t have to have them.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Like, something just clicks on and theyâ€™re like, â€œI guess itâ€™s time.â€ Itâ€™s like, It doesnâ€™t have to be. Youâ€™re human. You can decide. Youâ€™re not a dog. Itâ€™s not based on a smell. Think about it.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But I just-I never thought about having them. I never really wanted to have them. And people, you know, say to me, you know, like, â€œWell, donâ€™t you get lonely?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI do. I get very lonely. But I never think, like, a kid would make this better, you know?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Iâ€™ve had two wives and I got no kids. It takes a special kind of assholeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦to have two wives and no kids.
I think my second wife put it like this, â€œYou think Iâ€™m bringing children into this?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œIt was a different time.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Look, if you have love in your heart and you want to bring a kid in the world â€™cause you want to spread that love or whatever the way is. And thatâ€™s your impulse, thatâ€™s your reason. Good. Do it, you know. You know, I think itâ€™s a beautiful thing.
But if you have nothing but like a weird void where your heart should be and you think like, â€œA kid will fill this.â€ Maybe donâ€™t do it. Maybe donâ€™t.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Because that void will be passed along for generations. You canâ€™t stop the void from moving. You can now track your void on 23andMe.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
My void started in the chest of a tailorâ€™s wife in Belarusâ€¦ in the 1850s, in the Pale of Settlement, it was a-Itâ€™s a 99.9 percent Ashkenazi void. And youâ€™ve all been sitting in it for an hour now.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
People had children during the pandemic. What kind ofâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦cynical, selfish weirdosâ€¦ saw that as an opportunity to start a family? Like, thereâ€™s no cure, thereâ€™s no vaccine. And people are like, â€œLetâ€™s have a baby.â€
â€œWhat if we all die?â€
â€œThen weâ€™ll die as a family.â€
â€œI think we should do it.â€
At some point, those plague babies are going to want answers. Theyâ€™re gonnaâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦theyâ€™re gonna want to know what it was like before they were born. And some dad is going to have to step up and be like, â€œAll right, son, I think youâ€™re ready to hear this, youâ€™re five.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œBefore you were born, there was a horrible disease that was spreading around the world that killed millions of people. And there was no cure and no medicine for it. And we couldnâ€™t leave the house. Your mother and I were stuck in the house, for a long time!â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWe had to have food delivered. It was dark and scary. You just couldnâ€™t leave the house. And then eventually, you had to. You just had to get out. And you had to wear gloves and a mask and a visor. Yeah, kind of like a superhero. Like an angry superhero that just needed some space.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œAnd then your mom started making bread. I donâ€™t know why. So a lot of bread being made. It was like a bakery at the house, sometimes two, three loaves a day. Sometimes sheâ€™d walk into the living room with a loaf and say, â€˜I donâ€™t think this one turned out, but we can still eat it.â€™ And I ate it because I didnâ€™t want to hurt her feelings. It was a dark time!
Then puzzles started coming. There were puzzles coming. Yeah, I donâ€™t like puzzles. You donâ€™t like puzzles, do you? Theyâ€™re terrible, right? I know, right? Hundreds of puzzles it seemed like. Weâ€™re doing puzzles all the time. Weâ€™re watching movies weâ€™ve seen, like, five times. Weâ€™re eating bread. Itâ€™s the worst. It was terrible. And then, you know, she starts drinking wine and Iâ€™m like, â€˜All right, if sheâ€™s going to do it, Iâ€™ll drink scotch.â€™ And at some point, I just think we stopped loving each other andâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€œâ€¦Iâ€™ll be honest with you, I was Zooming with a woman from work andâ€¦ But I couldnâ€™t act on it. I donâ€™t know what she was doing. It was just bad. And, you know, we were fighting and drinking and eating bread. And one time we were just yelling at each other, weâ€™re crying, and it was very sad and we didnâ€™t know what to do. And, you know, I kicked over a puzzle because I was mad and I donâ€™t know, we just ended up having sex on the floor, right on the puzzle pieces. And puzzle pieces were sticking to us. I donâ€™t know. Well, thatâ€™s when we made you.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€œOh, shit. I think sheâ€™s here. Do you have all your stuff?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhereâ€™s your iPad? Is it in your backpack? Sheâ€™s coming. Just go. I donâ€™t want to talk. Just go out there. Go. Sheâ€™s getting out of the car. Go out there. You have everything? I love you. Iâ€™ll talk to you in a week. Donâ€™t tell her what I told you. Go. Get out there. Sheâ€™s coming.â€
Thatâ€™s a one-man show called Plague Baby.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)
Thank you.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Thatâ€™ll be running in repertory with Voices From the Future and Marc Maronâ€™s Kaddish: A Prayer for the Dead, in an evening of one-acts when they are all published in the same volume from the Samuel French Publishing Company.
The other reason Iâ€™m happy I donâ€™t have kids is, I have friends my age who have grown kids. Grown-ups. And if I havenâ€™t seen that friend in a while and ask him how his kids are, itâ€™s never a great story. I mean, itâ€™s likeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦70 percent of the time, itâ€™s not a good story. Soâ€¦
â€œHey, man, long time. How you been?â€
â€œIâ€™m dealing, you know how it is.â€
â€œYeah, man. Me, too. How are the kids?â€
â€œWell, you knowâ€¦ one of them is doing great. But the other one, I donâ€™t know, kind of got away from us. I donâ€™t know what the fuck happened. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s anyoneâ€™s fault, but fuck â€™em. Iâ€™ve had it. Got a guy out there looking for him again. Itâ€™s just bullshit. Itâ€™s killing his mother. I canâ€™t fucking take it. Fuck that kid. Butâ€¦ his sister is doing great. Just got in to a good school. Thanks for asking.â€
â€œThat sounds terrible.â€
â€œYou know how it is.â€
â€œI donâ€™t.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And then they always ask me the same thing if they know me, and I canâ€™t help but hear it as condescending, where theyâ€™re like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s right, you still got cats. How those cats doing?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But in my head, Iâ€™m always like, â€œGo fuck yourself. You think youâ€™re a better man than me because you have human kids.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œLike, that makes you more responsible? More evolved? A better human? Go fuck yourself.â€
I have three cats that I love and in the best case scenario, Iâ€™m going to have to have them all killed.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Iâ€™m going to have to kill my friends. And I knew it going in. Thatâ€™s how big my heart is.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
You canâ€™t have your drug-addled son put down, can you?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
No matter how much you want to, you canâ€™t walk into a veterinarianâ€™s office and just say, â€œI think itâ€™s time. Heâ€™s not grooming himself. Heâ€™s barely eating. Canâ€™t keep his head up. There we go. There we go.â€
â€œThis is a veterinarianâ€™s office. We donâ€™t do people.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œDoc, I got cash. How much would it take? Just help me out. Do me a-His mother thinks heâ€™s dead already. Canâ€™t you just bring him in back? Knock him out, burn him up, put him in a box. And if you want, you give me the handprint on the paper.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES) You kind of got to go all the way with that one. Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
â€œYeah, man, itâ€™s â€™cause Iâ€™m an anti-woke comedian.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Soâ€¦ (EXHALES DEEPLY) â€¦I almost bought a gun recently. My friends are like, â€œWhat, just for home protection?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know. It just feels like itâ€™s time.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES)
â€œWhat do you mean?â€
â€œWhen they come around looking for Jews who have had HBO specialsâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
â€œâ€¦I just want to go down shooting, thatâ€™s all. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll win. I just want to go down shooting. Thatâ€™s my right as an American. Thatâ€™s what the Second Amendment is all about. Itâ€™s like-Itâ€™s not about gun ownership. Itâ€™s about going down shooting!â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I currently have a bat. Iâ€™m a grown man with my own house on the second floor, in his own bedroom, with a bat next to his bed. That you can see. Like I live in a dorm room.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And Iâ€™ll be honest with you, I donâ€™t think I could hit a guy with a batâ€¦ let alone shoot a guy with a gun. I meanâ€¦ if youâ€™re going to hit a guy with a bat, you better have hit a guy with a bat before.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Or youâ€™re just going to end up getting hit with your own bat. Thatâ€™s how thatâ€™s going to go. And itâ€™sâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦and itâ€™s going to happen very quickly.
And youâ€™re not even going to understand how.
Youâ€™ll just be like, â€œGet the fuck out of my head! Whatâ€™s happening? Why am I running in my house? Ow!â€
And I have an alarm system. I have a very expensive, multi-laser alarm system that protects the gemstone I have in my foyer. Itâ€™s aâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Yeah, itâ€™s a gift from George Soros. Itâ€™s the bonus level.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
You know, when you replace a certain number.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But even with the alarm, if I hear something in my house, Iâ€™ll pick up that bat, upstairs, in my boxers. And Iâ€™ll pick it up and walk around. And a voice comes out of me that only comes out of me when Iâ€™m holding a bat.
And Iâ€™ll do it for you. But brace yourself.
Itâ€™s intense.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhatâ€™s going on down there?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhoâ€™s down there? Whatâ€™s going on?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
MARC: Yeah. Right.
If youâ€™re breaking into my house, you take pause.
â€œHoly shit. You hear that, man? That guy means business. Sounds like heâ€™s got a bat up there. Iâ€™ve been doing this a long time. Thatâ€™s definitely bat voice.â€
â€œIâ€™m coming down there!â€
â€œHe wonâ€™t. Not that guy.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES) â€œLetâ€™s just take the Jew stone and get out of here.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But Iâ€™ll be honest with you, I like having a bat becauseâ€¦ itâ€™s good. A bat is good.
Beca-Look, Iâ€™m a-You know, Iâ€™m a moody person.
I have good days, I have bad days, you know.
But in my heart, I know, that no matter how bad my day is, Iâ€™m never going to look at a bat and think, â€œIâ€™m going to kill myself.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Because that would take some timeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦and a level of commitment I donâ€™t think I have.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œFuck it, man. Fuck this shit. Fucking done with it, man.â€
(IMITATES CLACKING) â€œOw, fuck! Wow. Fuck, man. Whoo!â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œOh.â€
â€œFuck this life, man. I donâ€™t want to live anymore.â€ (IMITATES CLACKING)
â€œGod damn it.â€ (IMITATES CLACKING) â€œOw, fuck!â€
(IMITATES CLACKING, GROANS)
â€œI feel better.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
â€œWow. That was great. I think thatâ€™s all I needed. I got to remember that. I got to remember that.â€ Thank you very much.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
Thank you. Thank you very much.

<START>
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Bert Kreischer!
[audience cheering and applauding]
[dramatic music playing]
[audience continues cheering]
[audience cheering and applauding]
Yes! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. You look beautiful, sir.
[cheering continues]
Thank you. Thank you. [man wolf-whistles] I look beautiful. Thank you, sir.
[audience cheering]
This is the skinniest fat Iâ€™ve ever been.
[audience laughing and cheering]
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. [chuckles] Iâ€™m so fat, when I jog, my ass hairs tie in a knot. [audience laughing] Yeah. You donâ€™t even know itâ€™s happening. Itâ€™s really a treat. [audience laughing] Get in the shower, get a handful of soap, give yourself a little credit card action. [audience laughing] And you get denied. Iâ€™m talking rope, ladies. Ass cheek to ass cheek. Usually it comes free. Most hairy men andâ€¦ some Italian women will tell you that. [audience laughing] You just put your finger on top until youâ€™re free. Like when you sleep in a braid. Same thing.
[audience laughing]
One time, I was on vacation, and it wouldnâ€™t come free. Like, Iâ€™m the shower tugging. And Iâ€™m panicking too, because I got to take a shit. [audience laughing] If we donâ€™t do something, Iâ€™m gonna have a Play-Doh factory there. So I get out of the shower. I grab my pocket knife. I walk over to my wife. [audience laughing] [Bert laughs] [audience laughing] I go, â€œI need to know if youâ€™re on my team or off my team.â€ [audience laughing] [thick Southern accent] Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m on your team.â€ [normal voice] My wifeâ€™s a redneck. I should have told you that. On our marriage application, in her hometown, third question: â€œAre you blood relatives?â€
[audience laughing]
I go, â€œWhat do we put for three?â€ [Bert laughs] [audience laughs] The lady goes, â€œWell, is you?â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œI donâ€™t think we is.â€ [laughs] â€œThen put you ainâ€™t.â€ â€œIâ€™m not writing â€˜ainâ€™t.â€™ That means we is.â€ Soâ€¦ [audience laughing] I hand my wife the pocket knife, and I go, â€œWe have a problem.â€ I turn around, show her the affected area. [audience laughing] And she says, â€œWhy did you do that?â€ [audience laughing] Fantastic question, LeeAnn. You knowâ€¦ I figured, weâ€™re on vacation. Lady by the poolâ€™s like, â€œBraid your hair. Braid you hair.â€ [audience laughing] â€œI didnâ€™t do this on purpose, fuck nut.â€ [audience laughing] â€œNow get to cutting, Sweeney Todd. Iâ€™m cresting down here.â€
[audience laughing]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œI ainâ€™t doing that.â€ I was like, â€œHate to break your heart, redneck. I think you is.â€ [audience laughs] â€œAs a matter of fact, youâ€™re the only person on this island that will be cutting these ass hairs.â€ [audience laughs] I canâ€™t call the front desk and be like, â€œSend up a sure-handed boy.â€ [audience laughing] â€œBetter yet, who does your hedges? I like his work.â€
[audience laughing]
She goes, â€œNo, I ainâ€™t.â€ And she puts the knife down and turns on the hair dryer as if our conversationâ€™s over. Oh, you want to play games? Letâ€™s play fucking games. I grabbed the knife. Iâ€™m still naked, mind you. I sit down on the bed, facing her. Lay on my back, kick my feet in the air like a baby getting his diaper changed, and just go, â€œWah!â€ â€œBabyâ€™s got a knotty asshole!â€ [audience laughing] I didnâ€™t even hear my daughters walk in the room. [audience howling] [audience laughing] All I heard was, â€œOh my God, Dadâ€™s vagina!â€
[audience laughing]
Scared the shit outta me! [audience laughing] I hop up naked with a knife like Iâ€™m fighting two hookers for my wallet. [audience laughing] LeeAnn doesnâ€™t even know whatâ€™s going on. She sees the commotion, cuts off the hair dryer, and goes, â€œFine, give me the knife. Iâ€™ll cut your asshole.â€ [audience laughing] My daughters are shell-shocked. â€œWhat the fuck are you two doing?â€ [audience laughs] They storm out. I get in trouble. She goes, â€œYou know, heads-up, youâ€™re not supposed to show your daughters your dick.â€ [audience laughing] I was like, â€œObjection, Amber Heard. Thatâ€™s not what happened.â€ [audience laughing] Yeah. Walk it back, sister. [audience] Oh! Yes.
[audience cheering and applauding]
First off, they didnâ€™t just see my dick, okay? [audience laughs] That would have been a walk in the park. [audience laughs] They saw all of it. The trilogy. All three stories. Asshole, dick, and balls. The Middle East! [audience laughing] Secondly, I didnâ€™t show them my dick. I wasnâ€™t like, â€œHey, girlsâ€¦â€ [audience laughing] â€œYou almost done your homework?â€ [audience laughing] â€œCool. Meet me in the garage in 15. Thereâ€™s something I want to show you.â€ [audience laughing] [Bert chuckles] They didnâ€™t even see good dick either. Thatâ€™s what bothered me. No, hang on. Hear me out. Iâ€™m not saying I want it to be rock-hard, but, likeâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦pretty hard. You canâ€™t send your daughters to college thinking their dadâ€™s got the smallest dick.
[audience laughing]
First time they get a guy and theyâ€™re like, â€œNow, thatâ€™s a cock.â€ â€œShit!â€ â€œYeah, my dad has a penis. Thatâ€™s a cock.â€ â€œYou could whip that out at a party. My dadâ€™s got something you show a nurse.â€ [audience laughing] They saw belly dick. Just sitting there, defenseless, justâ€¦ [audience laughing] Looks like a whale breaching. Justâ€¦ [groans] [audience laughing] Canâ€™t tell where it starts, but you know where it stops. [audience laughing] Looks like a little boy looking in a well. â€œWhatâ€™s going on in here?â€ [audience laughing] What the fuck, I saw my dad naked. A lot. [audience laughing] A lotâ€¦ One time, he got in the shower with me. I was taking too long. He had work. I was in ninth grade.
[audience laughing]
Yeah, I panicked and did the old Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs, justâ€¦ [audience laughing] I saw my mom naked. Not a lot, but enough. [audience laughing] Enough that the first time I got a chick naked, I was like, â€œWhereâ€™s your C-section scar?â€ [audience laughing] [Bert chuckles] My wifeâ€™s honest with them. Sheâ€™s honest, 100% honest all the time. The other night weâ€™re at dinner. Iâ€™m three drinks in. The girls go, â€œYou guys ever done drugs?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are you, fucking cops?â€ [audience laughing] She just goes, â€œYeah.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œWhat the fuck you doing?â€ She goes, â€œYou got to be honest with them girls.â€ â€œI smoked marijuana a couple of times.â€ â€œI didnâ€™t like it very much.â€ â€œMade me throw up. Never smoked it again.â€ â€œBut your daddyâ€™s done cocaine.â€ I go, â€œWhat the fuck?â€ [audience laughing] â€œI donâ€™t think theyâ€™re looking for recommendations, LeeAnn.â€ [audience laughing] Sheâ€™s like, â€œGo on, tell â€™em. Go on, tell â€™em. Tell â€™em.â€ â€œTell â€™em the truth now.â€ I was like, â€œOkay, I tried cocaineâ€¦ one time.â€ [audience laughing] â€œI didnâ€™t like it very much.â€ [audience laughing] â€œIt made me throw up. Never did it again.â€ [audience laughing] I hear her fucking laughing. She goes, â€œThatâ€™s a lie. Your daddyâ€™s done cocaine a lot.â€ [audience laughing] â€œWell, your mom lost her virginity at 13. Go ahead, tell them that story. Yeah.â€ â€œYeah. Sheâ€™s a whore!â€ [Bert laughs]
[audience laughing]
And she just leans into me, she goes, â€œFirst of all, I was almost 14.â€ [audience laughing] â€œAnd shit, ainâ€™t nothing to do in my hometown but fuck, fight, and race.â€ [audience laughing] Iâ€™m like, â€œWho did I marry, Ricky Bobby?â€ [audience laughing] â€œSorry I ainâ€™t no prude like your daddy. Your daddyâ€™s only been with six people.â€ â€œAnd he lost his virginity when he was 17.â€ I was like, â€œFirst, Iâ€™ve been with six women, not people.â€ [audience laughing] And 17â€™s a normal number. But theyâ€™ve already heard 13. Now theyâ€™re looking at me, likeâ€¦ [gasps] â€œWere you homeschooled, Dad?â€ [audience laughing] Iâ€™m like, â€œThirteenâ€™s the fucked-up number in this story.â€ â€œSeventeenâ€™s normal. Iâ€™m so sorry I wasnâ€™t molested like your mother.â€
[audience laughing]
I didnâ€™t spend high school in the back of a pickup truck in a field all â€œNext!â€ [audience laughing] I fucking hate that I love this woman. [audience laughing] My buddyâ€¦ My buddy sold his company, made a lot of money, and got rid of his old wife, upgraded. Twenty-seven years old.
[scattered cheering]
Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. He brought her to our house, showing her off. â€œShe canâ€™t read at all.â€ [audience laughing] That night, I get in bed with my wife. My old one. [audience laughing] Socks on under the covers. [audience laughing] Sweater on. Bifocals. Reading a magazine. Gotta lick that dead old dry finger to turn a page. [audience laughing] [laughing] I was drunk. [audience laughing] [Bert laughs] I leaned overâ€¦ This is the relationship I have with my wife, okay? I just lean over, look at her, and goâ€¦ â€œI wonder what I could upgrade to.â€ [audience laughing] [laughing] She looks at me and goes, â€œIâ€™d like to see you fucking try.â€ [audience laughing] Sheâ€™s all, â€œYou wouldnâ€™t know what to do with the floor model.â€
[audience laughs]
New car smell with the push-button start. [imitates engine revving] I said, â€œYeah, Iâ€™ve been working with the old beater too long.â€ Justâ€¦ [imitates engine spluttering] You ever get your wife close to an orgasm and watch it just disappear? You get her right thereâ€¦ [engine cranking] [engine slowly revving] Then the cat jumps up on the bed. â€œAre we fucking this bitch?â€ [audience laughing] Youâ€™re like, â€œGoddamn it, Gus Gus, get the fuck out of here.â€ [audience laughing] Here, let me go. One, two, three. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s done. Jesus, fuck! [audience laughing] [audience member cheers] Iâ€™m fast at sex. Iâ€™m so fast, one time I had an orgasm and she laughed. [audience laughing] She goes, â€œShit, I donâ€™t think you couldâ€™ve gotten AIDS from that one.â€
[audience laughing]
Yeah. [laughs] Sheâ€™s a bully. A fucking bully. She doesnâ€™t give me a blowjob. Oh, no. She toys with me. Grabs my dick. Stares at me, just, â€œOh.â€ [audience laughing] [moans] [audience laughing] [moans] â€œOh, oh.â€ Is this thing on? [audience laughing] Do you know how soul-sucking it is to have to fake laugh to get your dick sucked? As a comedianâ€¦ I told my buddy Tom this, he goes, â€œThat would break my spirit.â€ He goes, â€œKnow what Iâ€™d do if I was lucky to suck your cock?â€ I was like, â€œPlease tell me.â€ [audience laughing] He said, â€œIâ€™d respect the fact that youâ€™re a comedian, and I would bring you original material every time.â€
[audience laughing]
I said, â€œLike what?â€ He didnâ€™t flinch. â€œIâ€™d grab your dick, look you in the eyes, and go, â€˜This week, on a very special episode of Man v. Food.'â€ [audience laughing] â€œâ€˜One man takes one dick to the mouth until it explodes.'â€ [moaning] We cried laughing. [audience laughing] And then one month later, Iâ€™m in bed with my wife. She goes down to give me a blowjob. I completely forgot the conversation I had with Tomâ€¦ [audience laughs] â€¦until sheâ€¦ taps on my dick, and I start laughing hysterically. [audience laughing] She goes, â€œFinally, you get it.â€ I said, â€œWhat?â€ She goes, â€œGet the joke? Itâ€™s a microphone.â€ I said, â€œYou thought I didnâ€™t get the joke?â€ [audience laughing] She goes, â€œYou donâ€™t laugh.â€ I said, â€œBecause itâ€™s not fucking funny.â€ She goes, â€œNot funny, why are you laughing now?â€ I said, â€œIâ€™m thinking about Tom.â€ [audience laughing]
[audience cheering]
â€œHe does this better than you.â€ [audience laughing] [Bert chuckles] Sheâ€™s turned my daughters into bullies. Yeah. We were watching a documentary the other night on Gandhi. All I said was, â€œI donâ€™t get the whole hunger strike thing.â€ My daughter Georgia looks me up and down and goes, â€œNo shit.â€ [audience laughing] They donâ€™t call me Dad. They have nicknames, like â€œChonk.â€
[audience laughing]
Or â€œFetus.â€ They call me â€œFetus.â€ [audience laughing] They had a nickname they were calling me behind my back for two years. Weâ€™re at dinner one night. LeeAnn sends a text. Both the girls giggle. â€œOh, good one, Mom.â€ [audience laughs] I said, â€œWhat is it?â€ They said, â€œYou wouldnâ€™t get it.â€ I said, â€œIâ€™m the funniest motherfucker at this table.â€ [audience laughing] â€œMy comedyâ€™s paying for this dinner and those teeth. Run it by me.â€
[audience laughing]
Ilaâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t think youâ€™d find it funny.â€ [giggles] So I go to the bathroom. I come back quick. I look over Ilaâ€™s shoulder. Sheâ€™s slow. [audience laughing] What I see is a series of pictures of me, and the chat thread is titled, â€œBaby Walrus.â€ [audience laughing] My stomach drops. I sit down at the table. I go, â€œWhat the fuck is Baby Walrus?â€ They freeze. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh, itâ€™s not, â€˜Whatâ€™s Baby Walrus?'â€ [audience laughs] â€œItâ€™s, â€˜Whoâ€™s Baby Walrus?'â€
[audience laughing]
I said, â€œWho the fuck is Baby Walrus?â€ Ila goes, â€œI think you know who Baby Walrus is.â€ Georgia goes, â€œCalm down, Dad.â€ â€œItâ€™s just Mom thinks when you put on fancy clothes, you look like a baby walrus whoâ€™s trying to escape from the zoo.â€ [audience laughing] I looked at LeeAnn. She goes, â€œCalm down. You actually behave like a baby walrus.â€ I said, â€œNo, I donâ€™t.â€ And then the waitress came over. She goes, â€œDouble Titoâ€™s and soda, big glass, no lime?â€ I didnâ€™t even think I did it. I wentâ€¦ [groaning] Ila pulls out here phone. â€œBaby Walrus loves vodka.â€ Click, click.
[audience laughing]
I will destroy these women. [audience laughing] My daughters are dumb as fuck. We went camping one time. [audience laughing] Whole family goes camping. Middle of nowhere. Ten oâ€™clock at night. Girls are roasting marshmallows. LeeAnnâ€™s over by the tent, cleaning up. Iâ€™m drinking moonshine. Ten oâ€™clock at night, we hear a gunshot ring out. Justâ€¦ [imitates gunshot] Weâ€™re frozen. LeeAnnâ€™s a redneck. Sheâ€™s like, â€œSomeone got their period,â€ or whatever. [audience laughing] [laughing] [audience continues laughing]
[audience cheering]
[Bert laughing] Sheâ€™s not even this big of a redneck, but she hates this accent. [audience laughs] So itâ€™s gonna get worse throughout the show. [audience laughing] Itâ€™s ten oâ€™clock at night. We heard a gunshot. Weâ€™re fucking frozen. No one says a word for ten seconds. And then we hear another gunshot ring out. [imitates gunshot] My daughter Ila pulls her marshmallow out of the fire, looks at all of us very confidently, and goes, â€œWellâ€¦ we know itâ€™s not a suicide.â€ [audience laughing] I was like, â€œThanks, Matlock.â€ [audience laughing] She goes, â€œTwo gunshots, Dad.â€ â€œI follow your math there, big brain.â€ [audience laughing] This child will make you stupid by proxy.
[audience laughing]
Weâ€™re in the car one time. Georgiaâ€™s up front, Iâ€™m driving. Ilaâ€™s in the back seat. And we drive past a sign that says, â€œDeaf child.â€ And immediately I hear the think tank in the back start bubbling. [audience laughing] Ila just, to herself, goes, â€œOh, well, thatâ€™s racist.â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œNope. No, itâ€™s not. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s not what racism looks like.â€ And Georgia goes, â€œIla, they put that sign up so we know when weâ€™re in this neighborhood we should lower our radios.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuck?â€ [audience laughing] â€œNo, finish this. I want to hear the end of this.â€ [audience laughing] She goes, â€œSo we donâ€™t rub it in that we can hear, right, Dad?â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, thatâ€™s notâ€¦ Shit, youâ€™re dumber than she is.â€ â€œNo. No.â€ â€œNo, Georgia, thatâ€™s not why they have that.â€ â€œItâ€™s so you know thereâ€™s a kid that may not hear your car coming, Georgia.â€ And then Ila leans up at the front and goes, â€œSo are deaf kids like guns?â€ [audience laughs] â€œDo you have to register them with the state?â€ [audience laughing] Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ She goes, â€œWell, Dad, how do they know where to put those signs?â€ [audience laughing] And now Iâ€™m sitting in the front seat of this clown car, thinking sincerely to myself, â€œHow do they know where to put those signs?â€ [audience laughing] You cannot put me and this child together. Weâ€™re bad news.
[audience laughs]
Weâ€™re dumb as fuck and we have impulse control problems. [audience laughing] We went to Georgiaâ€™s choir concert one time. Four hours long, just to set the scene. Four hours of choir. And LeeAnn doesnâ€™t even sit in the room. She sits in the back and sells baked goods with friends and chitchats for hours. Meanwhile, Ila and I have to sit in the front row for four hours. Sheâ€™s having a blast. Ila and I are getting fucked in the ass.
[audience laughing]
Two hours into this choir concert, choir teacher comes out and lets us know theyâ€™re auctioning use of the school snow machine to the highest bidder. Opening bid is $50, and I feel Ila shaking like a junkie next to me. [audience laughing] I go, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with you?â€ And she goes, â€œFetusâ€¦â€ [audience laughing] â€œâ€¦we need that snow machine.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œUh, weâ€™re getting that fucking snow machine.â€ [audience laughing] Sheâ€™s like, â€œShould I go out and ask Mom?â€ â€œFuck that bitch. Sheâ€™s not here.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œIâ€™m a parent also, Ila. I can make decisions too.â€ [audience laughing] Sheâ€™s like, â€œDo we have $50?â€ I go, â€œBaby, without your mom in the room, we have stupid fucking money.â€ [audience laughing] â€œWatch and learn. Iâ€™m about to drop a big dick on this room.â€ [audience laughing] I stand up in the front row. Teacher gets excited. â€œDo I hear an opening bid of $50?â€ I said, â€œHoney, cut out the riffraff.â€ â€œMake it 500.â€ [audience cheers] Room goes crazy. I sit down. Ilaâ€™s shaking back and forth. â€œAhh!â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?â€ She goes, â€œYou just dropped a big dick on the room, Dad!â€
[audience cheering and applauding]
Laughter dies out. I hear one dad in the back still laughing. Iâ€™m like, â€œShit, we got a problem.â€ [audience laughing] Ilaâ€™s like, â€œWhat is it?â€ â€œThereâ€™s another alcoholic dad here looking for action.â€ [audience laughing] â€œItâ€™s gonna be a long night, baby.â€ Dude in the back just stands up quick, â€œ550!â€ Whole room does that. â€œOh!â€ Except for my daughter, who punches me in the leg and goes, â€œStand up and be a man.â€ [audience laughing] â€œTell him 600, Dad.â€ I said, â€œNo, baby, thatâ€™s not how weâ€™re gonna play it.â€ â€œNowâ€™s when we hit him with the razzle dazzle.â€
[audience cheering]
Sheâ€¦ She goes, â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ I said, â€œYou stand up, you say 600, then turn around and wink at him.â€ [audience laughs] Now sheâ€™s turned into a baby walrus. [groaning] She goes, â€œI can do that?â€ I go, â€œIf you donâ€™t, you sleep outside.â€ [audience laughing] This is what a thousand parents saw: a fifth grader in the front row stand up. In fairness, I didnâ€™t know she was nervous. I also didnâ€™t know the kid couldnâ€™t fucking wink, okay?
[audience laughing]
[scoffs] Who the fuck canâ€™t wink? [audience laughing] She turns around trembling. Finds her guy, goes, â€œ$600!â€ And then proceeds to have a seizureâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦trying to eke out a wink. Justâ€¦ [audience laughing] Sits down, she goes, â€œHow did I do, Dad?â€ [audience laughs] I go, â€œYou just dropped a big dick on that room.â€ [audience laughing] Old boy in the back is losing his fucking mind. He stands up, he goes, â€œBaby girl, $700.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhoa, you coming after my daughter, bro?â€ [audience laughing] I stand up, stare him down, I go, â€œ$800.â€ Ila stands up, â€œ$900!â€ [audience laughing]
[scattered applause and cheering]
Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re bidding against me, you fucking moron.â€ [audience laughing] Sheâ€™s ear to ear, â€œHit him with the razzle dazzle, Dad!â€ [audience laughing] We won that snow machine for $1,800.
[audience laughing and cheering]
Yeah.
[audience cheering and applauding]
Yeah. [applause continues] I gotâ€¦ I got in trouble. [audience laughing] I did. My behavior wasâ€¦ questionable. [audience laughing] I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™sâ€¦ I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s me or the fact that I live in L.A. Like, I think if I lived here, Iâ€™d be like a pretty normal dad.
[audience cheering and applauding]
Dare I say progressive. [laughs] [audience laughing] But in L.A., Iâ€™m a problem. Iâ€™llâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonnaâ€¦ Okay, Iâ€™m gonna tell you a story. But do not insert your politics into it, okay? Just listen to the story, enjoy it for what it is. Okay. [audience laughing] End of Ilaâ€™s fifth grade year, they throw a dance. They taught all the kids the foxtrot in fifth grade, right? Parents sit in the auditorium and we watch kids do the foxtrot on stage, go out, milk and cookies 8:30 in the morning, call it a day. Boom. We show up at eight oâ€™clock. Kids arenâ€™t on stage. Kids were in the auditorium. Teachers off to the side. Sheâ€™s crying. Parents are irate. Itâ€™s a shitshow. Pull us outside as the parents. Teacher addresses the parents. â€œIâ€¦â€ [exhales] â€œAll I can do is apologize.â€ â€œWhat Iâ€™ve done is horrific.â€ â€œAnd if youâ€™ll allow me the opportunity to keep my job, I will do better.â€ In the back, Iâ€™m like, â€œSomeone fucked a kid.â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m starting to loosen up to go high-five a fifth grader. [audience laughing] And she saysâ€¦ â€œTwo weeks ago, in preparing for this dance, I assumed your childrenâ€™s gender, and I paired them up boy, girl.â€ â€œNow, I understand what an egregious error I have made, and if you give me an opportunity, I will show you Iâ€™m not the monster you think I am.â€ Now, hold on. I want to say this real quick, just so weâ€™re clear. I want every child in this world to feel 100% awesome 100% of the time. Iâ€™ll do what I can to make that happen, that is how I feel.
[audience cheering and applauding]
But itâ€™s fifth grade, right? Likeâ€¦ [audience laughs] Itâ€™s 8:00 in the morning. Weâ€™re hungover. Letâ€™s wrap it up. [audience laughs, cheers] I think weâ€™re done, right? Cool? Forgiven. First parent stands up. She goes, â€œMy name is Jennifer. Pronouns: she/her.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, shit.â€ [audience laughing] â€œThis isnâ€™t gonna go well.â€ She goesâ€¦ â€œOur household are strong allies.â€ â€œWe have family members in the community, and I want you to know that I can hear that apology, but it is shallow.â€ â€œActions speak louder than words, so if you do keep your job, you should do better.â€ And she sits down. Now, I donâ€™t know if you know how this works, but the next parent has to out-liberal the first parent. [audience laughs] You canâ€™t be like, â€œEh,â€ because then you look like Alex Jones. â€œFrogs are gay. Hoo!â€ [audience laughing] And it goes around the horn. They light this bitch up left and right. And the teacher, God bless her, sheâ€™s taking it on the chin until it gets to me and LeeAnn. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ll take this.â€ LeeAnnâ€™s like, â€œPlease donâ€™t.â€
[audience laughing]
I said, â€œHi, my nameâ€™s Bert. Iâ€™m Ilaâ€™s, uh, parent.â€ [audience laughing] I said, â€œFirst off, itâ€™s fifth grade.â€ â€œNo oneâ€™s finger-fucking in the back of a Jetta tonight.â€ [audience laughing] Itâ€™s 8:30 in the morning. Everyoneâ€™s listening now, right? [audience laughing] I said, â€œAs Ilaâ€™s parent, it goes without saying that I do not care if my child dances with a boy or dances with a girl.â€ â€œI will do everything in my power to love her and support her.â€ [audience cheers] Yeah.
[audience cheering and applauding]
â€œAs long as itâ€™s white.â€ Nowâ€¦ [audience laughing] How do you not go for the fucking joke? Itâ€™s right there! Itâ€™s rightâ€¦ Itâ€™s 8:00 in the morning. They didnâ€™t see it coming. [audience laughing] The pronoun parents lost their fucking shit. [screams] LeeAnn hops up. [in thick Southern accent] â€œHeâ€™s a comedian! Heâ€™s a comedian!â€
[audience laughing]
Theyâ€™re like, â€œListen to her accent. Theyâ€™re racist!â€ Dude, Iâ€™ll tell you the worst one. The worst one, LeeAnn and I one time went to a wine tasting-slash-raffle. Tuesday nightâ€¦ On the way there, LeeAnnâ€™s in the car. Sheâ€™s driving. Sheâ€™s like, â€œLetâ€™s not get fucking wasted tonight.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œToo late!â€
[audience laughing]
â™ª Iâ€™ve been drinking in the shower â™ª
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s a Tuesday night. Iâ€™m getting ripped. Are you kidding me? Yeah, I have a one-hitter in my pocket. Itâ€™s going down. [audience laughing] I get there. Iâ€™ve never been to a wine tasting. They donâ€™t give you, like, big goblets. They give you these baby cups, like Michael Jacksonâ€™s about to eat our assholes. [audience laughing] I think thatâ€™s how he did it. Iâ€™m not sure. [audience laughing] So I bail on the tasting. Find the dads that party. Ten dads over by the stage. Theyâ€™ve already bought all their wine. Theyâ€™ve opened up the bottles and drinking like itâ€™s Game of Thrones. [audience laughs] One dadâ€™s in an Austin 3:16 shirt. Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s my fucking table.â€
[audience laughs]
So I go over to them, chop it up. Work my way to the raffle towards the end of the night. My buddy Darrenâ€™s running the raffle. I go, â€œYoâ€¦â€ â€œWhat you got in the pot?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ve only sold 40 tickets.â€ I said, â€œOh, your prizes suck?â€ He goes, â€œNo, I got 12 great prizes.â€ I said, â€œBullshit. Why is no one buying tickets?â€ He goes, â€œThe parents found out that the money for this raffle doesnâ€™t go to our school, but an underprivileged school.â€ â€œThey donâ€™t want to chip in if their kids wonâ€™t benefit.â€ â€œTheyâ€™d rather spend money on wine.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œAre you fucking serious?â€ He goes, â€œI guess.â€ I said, â€œOkay.â€ â€œHow many tickets do you want to sell?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWell, 700 is our goal.â€ I said, â€œCool, put me in for 660.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œFor real?â€ I said, â€œYeah, but close the raffle now.â€ [audience laughing] He goes, â€œIf I do, youâ€™re gonna win a lot of the prizes.â€ I go, â€œDarren, I want to win all of them.â€
[audience laughing]
He goes, â€œIf you do that, thatâ€™ll upset some parents.â€ I go, â€œIt would break my heart if it didnâ€™t.â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œYou want to make your money or not?â€ He goes, â€œI want to make that money.â€ I said, â€œGive me 660 tickets, close the raffle right now, and do not tell a soul.â€ [audience laughing] â€œWhat about LeeAnn?â€ â€œDefinitely donâ€™t tell her.â€ [audience laughing] This man took me to the back of a wine bar and started a giggle that lasted the entire evening as he peeled offâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦six hundred and sixty tickets. When he handed them to me, he was shaking like he was selling drugs in ninth grade.
[audience laughing]
I ripped off the first ticket and the last ticket. I said, â€œDarren, anything in between, you know I have.â€ [audience laughs] I have never been more excited for any event in my life. The birth of my children? [blows raspberry] [audience laughing] I picked the table furthest from the stage where they were calling the numbers and mapped out my parade route. [audience laughing] I had two tickets in my hand. LeeAnn came over. â€œYou bought raffle tickets?â€ I go, â€œA couple.â€ [audience laughing] He called the first number. I practically leapt out of my shoes. I was like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s me!â€
[audience laughing]
I bumped into every parent on the way. â€œOh, Iâ€™m so sorry.â€ [giggles] â€œNo, I won. I have the winning ticket, Iâ€¦â€ â€œThereâ€™s 12 prizes, and I won the first one!â€ â€œBert Kreischer. Yes, thatâ€™s my name. Iâ€™m so sorry.â€ [audience laughs] I get to the stage, grab my prize. Ten drunk dads are there. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat did you win, Bert?â€ I go, â€œItâ€™s a Fitbit.â€ [giggles] â€œIâ€™ll be tracking my steps tonight, boys.â€
[audience laughing]
Get back to the table, look at LeeAnn. I go, â€œMake some fucking room.â€ [audience laughing] He calls out the next number. I go, â€œOh shit!â€ [audience laughing] â€œThatâ€™s me too!â€ I start to walk. My wife, unprovoked, stands up on the foot of her stool and announces to this wine bar, [in thick Southern accent] â€œMy husband is the luckiest guy in the world!â€ [audience laughing] â€œSwear to God, I swear to God.â€ â€œI wouldnâ€™t be shocked if he won all 12 prizes.â€ [audience laughing and applauding] Iâ€™m on stage now, like, â€œFrom her mouth to Godâ€™s ears.â€ [audience laughing] Grab my prize. Ten drunk dads are like, â€œWhat did you win?â€ â€œDonâ€™t know, donâ€™t fucking care.â€ [audience laughing] Get back to the center, I go, â€œCall the next fucking number, Darren.â€ [audience laughs] He calls it, I look at LeeAnn, I go, â€œBingo, bitch!â€ [audience laughing] The king is back!
[audience cheering and applauding]
[Bert laughs]
[cheering and applause continues]
Now Iâ€™m just staring at parents, going, â€œWhat did I win, Darren?â€ He is crying-laughing, and he goes, â€œDiamond earrings.â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œWell, pierce my ears and call me Kaitlyn.â€
[audience cheering and laughing]
Iâ€™m on stage putting diamonds in my high school holesâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦when I see the energy of the room shift. Itâ€™s starting in the back with a circle of people around the principal, who yells out, â€œCheck his tickets!â€ I yell back, â€œMind your own business!â€
[audience laughing]
She does not like that. And now she storms the stage. â€œI see three prizes but only two tickets.â€ â€œI want to see his tickets.â€ Darren Turbow is laughing way too hard to do anything. And I watch the energy of the room halt. The dudes in the kitchen, theyâ€™re not cooking anymore. Theyâ€™re looking out that little sliver of a window, justâ€¦ The bartender who was making a drink audibly slows down, justâ€¦ [imitates shaker slowing down]
[audience laughing]
The ten drunk dads who trusted me now are looking at me like I let them down. [audience laughing] The way a child looks at his sports hero and goes, â€œSay it ainâ€™t so, OJ.â€
[audience laughing]
[scattered applause]
I let that energy breatheâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦as I reached into my pockets, grabbed onto 658 tickets like they were a hot rattlesnake, threw them in the air and went, â€œRead â€™em and weep, motherfuckers!â€
[audience laughing, cheering, and applauding]
The room went fucking bananas. Ten drunk dads pounding on the table. â€œLetâ€™s fucking go!â€ [audience laughs] The principal is livid. I look at LeeAnn. She is not laughing. [audience laughing] Principal sees this, makes a beeline to my wife, gets in her face and goes, â€œYou need to make him stop right now.â€ [audience laughs] My wife doesnâ€™t even miss a beat. Takes a breath and goesâ€¦ [inhales] â€œSugar, he hasnâ€™t even started.â€ [audience laughing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
Oh. â€œHoney, honey, thereâ€™s nine more prizes and his shirtâ€™s still on.â€ â€œItâ€™s gonna get way worse.â€ [audience laughs and cheers] Then my wife kills her glass of red wine, looks at the stage and goesâ€¦ [in Southern accent] â€œCall the next fucking number, Darren.â€ [audience laughing] Prize number four, my shirt came off. [audience laughs and cheers] Prize number five, Steve Austinâ€™s shirt came off. [audience laughing] Prize number six, a mom unwittingly in the back said just a little too loud, â€œWho the fuck is this guy?â€ [audience laughs] To which the bartender replied, â€œHeâ€™s the fucking machine!â€
[audience cheering and applauding]
[Bert laughs] [Bert laughing]
[cheering and applause continues]
By prize 11, the room was polarized. [audience laughing] You either absolutely loved what was going on, like the ten drunk dads and the bartenderâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦or you hated it. And if you hated it, you were now surrounding the stage protesting the raffle. [audience laughing] These Capitol stormersâ€¦ [audience laughing] [audience cheers] â€¦were unhappy with the outcome of their day, and took it uponâ€¦ Look, when he called prize 12, I knew what I had to do. I had to hit him with the â€œsuck it.â€ Justâ€¦ [grunts]
[man in audience] Suck it!
Twenty of them, just around the horns. Suck it! Suck it! Suck it! Suck it! Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck! Suck! [audience laughing] I was ready. It was my job. And as he called the number, I go to hit the first â€œSuck itâ€ and realize I donâ€™t have that ticket. [audience laughing] Oh, you think you were upset? Ten drunks dads are pounding on the table going, â€œRecount! Recount!â€ [audience laughing] The people that hated me were mocking me at the top of their lungs. Theyâ€™re like, â€œThatâ€™s what you get, fat boy!â€ â€œPut your shirt on, loser! Youâ€™re a loser!â€ They were so loud, I could barely hear my wife in the back go, â€œOh, thatâ€™s me!â€
[audience laughing, cheering, and applauding]
We won all 12 prizes.
[audience laughing and cheering]
And then I spent the rest of the night drunk, shirtless with my ears piercedâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦holding 11 prizes, walking up to parents, going, â€œWhat did you guys win?â€ [audience laughing] â€œOh, I won everything. I totally forgot.â€ [audience laughing] The best part of that story, in my opinion, is that LeeAnn got it. That she got theâ€¦ She doesnâ€™t always get the joke, you know? Like, some things justâ€¦ [audience laughing] January 2020. Iâ€™m on a flight with my wife to Burlington, Vermont. We get a text from my buddy, Tom Segura. Nowâ€¦ yes, yeah.
[audience cheering]
If you do not know who that is, heâ€™s a stand-up comedian who cannot doâ€¦ that. Soâ€¦ [audience laughing] That simple act.
[audience cheering]
That little act will make this leg explode. [audience laughs] And this arm will break in half right here and spin in circles. Crazy. Crazy. Big racist. Now he saidâ€¦ [audience laughing] Yeah, yeah. Big fan of Nazis. Anywayâ€¦ Tom sends me and LeeAnn a text, a group text, and it says, â€œHey, I donâ€™t know if you guys have heard about this new virus called the coronavirus, but itâ€™s a real thing, and I just read an article in the L.A. Times.â€ â€œThereâ€™s been an outbreak in your neighborhood.â€ â€œHereâ€™s a link to the article. You might want to check it out.â€ This is January 2020. Iâ€™m in a panic. I have heard of it, but in our neighborhood? So I clicked the link. I donâ€™t know if you got this. [audience laughing] But it wasnâ€™t an article. [audience laughing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
It was a picture of a Black manâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦naked on the side of a bed, justâ€¦ [audience laughing and applauding]
[audience cheering and applauding]
I open the link, see the picture, I laugh. Itâ€™s funny, right? [audience laughs] I finish my double Jack on the rocks, lots of rocks. [audience laughs] I pass out. I wake up in Burlington, Vermont to my wife in a tizzy. Weâ€™re on the tarmac and she goes, â€œDid you get that text from Tommy?â€ [audience laughs] I said, â€œYeah, I did.â€ [audience laughs] She goes, â€œFucking terrifying.â€
[audience laughing]
I said, â€œI wouldnâ€™t say that. I think thatâ€™s racist.â€ [audience laughing] I mean, itâ€™s more than I could fit, but yeah. [audience laughing] She goes, â€œNo, itâ€™s in our neighborhood.â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œDid you click the link?â€ She goes, â€œNo, I didnâ€™t have time.â€ â€œFlight attendant made me put my phone away.â€ I said, â€œYou have to click the link.â€ [audience laughing] She goes, â€œIs it bad?â€ I said, â€œWorse than you think.â€ [audience laughing] [Bert laughing] And I watched this woman click that link. And the picture of that manâ€¦ His nameâ€™s Wood, fittingly. [audience laughs] â€¦comes up, and I watch her just see it, and she goes, â€œOh no!â€ And swipes out. My wife doesnâ€™t like looking at big cocks. Soâ€¦ [audience laughing] Thankfully. She looks at me, confused. Now, Iâ€™m just chuckling. [audience laughing] She clicks the link again. [audience laughing] Must have been user error, right?
[audience laughing]
Same picture shows up, only this time I watch her attempt to scrollâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦as if sheâ€™s gonna find an article attached to that picture. [audience laughing] Finds no such article. Swipes out. Clicks the link a third fucking time. [audience laughing] I am now crying-laughing. And she goes, â€œI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s so funny. My phoneâ€™s broken.â€ [audience laughing] I said, â€œItâ€™s a joke.â€ She goes, â€œWhat?â€ I said, â€œWhat do you mean, â€˜Whatâ€™?â€ â€œItâ€™s a picture.â€ â€œYou thought youâ€™d read an article, now youâ€™re looking at this cock.â€ â€œItâ€™s a joke.â€ [audience laughing] She goes, â€œThatâ€™s not funny.â€ [audience laughing] I said, â€œI disagree.â€ [audience laughing] I watched you open it three times. It got funnier and funnier. [audience laughing] Her face goes white and she goes, â€œNo, thatâ€™s not funny.â€ â€œI sent that to all the moms at Georgiaâ€™s school.â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œYouâ€™re right, thatâ€™s not funny. Thatâ€™s fucking epic!â€ [audience laughing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
I grab her phone and read the replies from the moms. The best were the cool moms who were like, â€œI hope that doesnâ€™t hit my house.â€ [audience laughing] One mom was like, â€œMy ninth grader is not ready for that.â€ [audience laughs] Our friend Lynn Gruson wrote back, â€œAre you sure thatâ€™s the coronavirus?â€ â€œI think I had that in college.â€ [audience laughing] And then she goes even paler and she goes, â€œI sent that to our girls.â€ [audience laughing] I called Georgia, I go, â€œGeorge, Mom sent you a link to an article.â€ â€œDid you see it?â€ She goes, â€œDad, I canâ€™t unsee it.â€ [audience laughing] â€œI was at softball practice. I opened it in front of the coach.â€ [audience laughing] I was like, â€œWhat did Coach say?â€ [audience laughs] â€œCoach said we need to get one for batting practice.â€ [laughs] [audience laughing] I go, â€œWhat about your sister?â€ She throws Ila the phone. I go, â€œIla, Mom sent you a link. Did you see it?â€ She goes, â€œI did.â€ [audience laughing] I said, â€œWhat did you think?â€ She goes, â€œInteresting article.â€
[audience laughing]
My daughters have the most fucked-up sense of humor. [audience laughing] For Georgiaâ€™s birthday one year, she gets a psychic. Sheâ€™s gonna tell her and all her friends about their past lives, right? The lady comes to the house. Sheâ€™s 100 years old. Sits down across from Georgia and her friends. Ila and I are at the end. She goes, â€œOkay, whoâ€™s the birthday girl?â€ Ila hits me and goes, â€œOne hell of a psychic, Dad.â€ [Bert laughing] [audience laughing] [Bert snorts] Georgiaâ€™s like, â€œI am, I am!â€ She puts her palm out and the lady goes, â€œOkayâ€¦â€ â€œIn a past life, you were a general in a great war.â€ â€œYou were responsible for the death of 257 men.â€ â€œThose menâ€™s souls will haunt you until the day you die.â€ Ilaâ€™s next to me. She just goesâ€¦
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª
[Bert laughing]
[audience laughing]
The best one, from one of Georgiaâ€™s birthdays. Both the girls pull me aside, â€œHey, Dad.â€ â€œWe want to go to an escape room.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBoth you geniuses?â€ [audience laughing] â€œYou guys gonna put all 80 IQ points together and see what happens in a room?â€ Shut the fuck up! [laughs] Theyâ€™re like, â€œWe want you to go too.â€ I go, â€œYou want to add drugs and alcohol? Okay.â€ [audience laughing] â€œGood call.â€ They go, â€œNo, you and Papa.â€ I go, â€œIâ€™m gonna stop you right there.â€ [audience laughs] â€œUh, me and my dad donâ€™t work well together as a team.â€ â€œOkay, ladies? Itâ€™s not gonna end well. Itâ€™s gonna end horrifically.â€ And they both are looking at me, and they go, â€œYeah, we know.â€ [audience laughing] I said, â€œWhat?â€ Georgia goes, â€œThatâ€™s what I want for my birthday.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œI want to see Papa lose his shit and you have a panic attack.â€ [audience laughing] I was like, â€œAll right, heâ€™s cheap. Iâ€™ll call him.â€ [audience laughing] So I call my dad. My dad is 75 years old. Lives in Tampa. Losing his hearing. I go, â€œHey, Dad. When you guys are out in L.A., the girls want to go to an escape room.â€ He goes, â€œRape room?â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œYeah, Dad, thatâ€™s what they want.â€ [audience laughing] â€œThey want to go get raped together. All of us.â€ [audience laughs] â€œAnd then after weâ€™ve all been raped, we want to go to The Cheesecake Factory.â€
[audience laughing]
I go, â€œNo, Dad, an escape room.â€ And he goes, â€œEscape room? What the fuckâ€™s an escape room?â€ And I hear my mom in their kitchen, going, â€œYes! Weâ€™re going!â€ â€œI saw about this on the internet. Weâ€™re going!â€ â€œIâ€™ve always wondered how Iâ€™d fare in a kidnapping.â€ [audience laughing] My dadâ€™s like, â€œPump your brakes. Weâ€™re not going.â€ â€œWhat the fuck is an escape room?â€ And my momâ€™s like, â€œThey grab you, they throw you in a van.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œDonâ€™t listen to Mom, Dad.â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œDad, itâ€™s a room where we pay these kids 200 bucks.â€ â€œThey lock us in the room, and we gotta figure out how to get out.â€ And heâ€™s quiet on the phone for a second, then he goes, â€œGive me 50 bucks. Iâ€™ll lock your kids in a car.â€
[audience laughing]
[Bert chuckles] My mom snatches the phone away and goes, â€œTell my granddaughters weâ€™re going.â€ â€œThey can count on us.â€ â€œAre we supposed to wear leather?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œEasy, Mom.â€ [audience laughing] So we go. Me, my wife, my parents, my daughters. We all go. Now, hereâ€™s where it starts to veer wrong. As we start driving, you know how escape rooms normally happen in, like, a mall? This was in a dudeâ€™s house. [audience laughing] He had converted every room in his house into an escape room, much like John Wayne Gacy. [audience laughing] We pull into the neighborhood. My dadâ€™s like, â€œNo fucking way.â€ [audience laughing] Georgiaâ€™s like, â€œPop, I heard itâ€™s really scary.â€ He goes, â€œIâ€™m shitting my pants now, ladies.â€ We see a house painted all black, no landscaping. LeeAnnâ€™s like, â€œI think thatâ€™s it.â€ My dadâ€™s like, â€œKeep fucking going.â€
[audience laughing]
Get out, go up to the door, knock on the door. Dudeâ€™s already in character. Oh. Dude, itâ€™s L.A. This guyâ€™s good. Silk robe, towel around his head, stroking a kitty cat. And he just goesâ€¦ â€œHave you seen my mother?â€ My dad grabs my hand, he goes, â€œWhat the fuck did he just say?â€ [audience laughing] I go, â€œHeâ€™s looking for his mother.â€ He goes, â€œTell him his mother can suck my dick.â€
[audience laughing]
My dadâ€™s like, â€œIs this real? Is this real?â€ I go, â€œItâ€™s part of the escape room. Play along.â€ He goes, â€œWould you like to see a tour of my house?â€ And my momâ€™s, â€œYes, we would love to see a tour.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s your momâ€™s name? How old is she? Whereâ€™d she go to college? Take notes.â€ So we go on a tour of the house. The women are into it. And my dad is picking this guy apart left and right. Heâ€™s likeâ€¦ [sniffs] â€œHe smells like shit.â€ [audience laughing] â€œBuddy, I think he fucking lives here. I think he livesâ€¦â€ â€œWhat kind of fucking lunatic lives where every room is anâ€¦â€ â€œHe was just eating lunch.â€ â€œHeâ€™s eating mac and cheese with coffee. Who the fuck drinks coffeeâ€¦â€ â€œBlack coffee with mac and cheese? Heâ€™s got IBS, I guarantee you.â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t think these are helpful clues, Dad.â€ [laughs] The guy comes in. â€œLike to see Motherâ€™s room?â€ My dad goes, â€œAbsolutely fucking not.â€ [audience laughs] My momâ€™s like, â€œYes, we want to see.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œMother doesnâ€™t allow car keys, cell phones, or wallets, so empty your pockets and put them on the kitchen table.â€ And like sheep, weâ€™re like, â€œOkay.â€ [audience laughing] We empty our pockets. Walk into the room. And the second I step into the room, I feel the door shut and lock behind me. And I have a panic attack. [audience laughing] The first thing I think is, he didnâ€™t ask our names. [audience laughing] We didnâ€™t give him a credit card. [audience laughing] We didnâ€™t fill out a waiver.
[audience laughing]
We didnâ€™t even really check the address. [audience laughing] We just saw one sketchy house in a neighborhood, knocked on the door, he presented a problem, and weâ€™re like, â€œThe Scooby-Doo gang will figure it out.â€ [audience laughing] Now weâ€™re locked in this fucking house. My dadâ€™s next to me going, â€œTell me where I steer wrong in this story.â€ [audience laughs] â€œDid you just walk your family into a serial killerâ€™s house?â€ [audience laughs] Georgia goes, â€œPapa, isnâ€™t this scary?â€ He goes, â€œYou have no fucking idea.â€ [audience laughing] â€œYou two are getting sold to the goddamn Albanians tonight.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYouâ€™ll be working in a Chechen whorehouse the rest of your lives.â€ Ilaâ€™s like, â€œPapa, how do we get out of here?â€ He goes, â€œI think I have to suck that guyâ€™s dick.â€ [audience laughing] â€œSomeoneâ€™s sucking his dick. I nominate your shithead dad.â€ [audience laughing] My momâ€™s in the corner, â€œYou think heâ€™s gonna tie us up?â€ My dadâ€™s like, â€œShut the fuck up, Maggie!â€ [audience laughs] â€œYour shithead son just walked us into a serial killerâ€™s house who smells like shit.â€ â€œDid anyone smell this guy?â€ â€œMaybe itâ€™s because he eats mac and cheese and coffee all fucking day.â€ Guyâ€™s like, â€œSir, I can hear you.â€ [audience laughing] Now Iâ€™m having a full-blown anxiety attack, and for me, they happen in my stomach, and I have to shit immediately.
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™m looking around the room for a vase or something to shit in. [audience laughs] My dad knows me way too well. He goes, â€œOh fucking no, you donâ€™t!â€ â€œItâ€™s tennis camp all over again. Heâ€™s gonna shit in the houseplant.â€ â€œGoddamn it, this fucking shithead walks us into a serial killerâ€™s house, and now heâ€™s gonna shit in his momâ€™s room?â€ [audience laughing] My daughters are skipping, theyâ€™re so excited. [audience laughs] My wife is a fucking savage. She saw four clues by herself. [audience laughing] Pulls a lever under the desk. House lights drop out. We hear two screams and a thud. Lights click back on. Iâ€™m holding both my daughters like a human shield. [audience laughing] My motherâ€™s on the floor in a steamer trunk. â€œYour father threw me into the wall!â€ [audience laughing] My dadâ€™s like, â€œFuck her, sheâ€™s a liar. She tripped.â€ [audience laughing] Guyâ€™s like, â€œI saw it. He threw her into the wall.â€
[audience laughing]
LeeAnn solves two more clues and a trapdoor opens up out of the wall, exposing a crawl space two feet tall by three feet wide, down the length of the wall into another room. My mom sticks her head in. Pops out and goesâ€¦ [gasps, chuckles] â€œI think we should all get in the wall.â€ [audience laughing] My dadâ€™s like, â€œYou first.â€
[audience laughing]
She gets in the wall, he goes, â€œFuck her, sheâ€™s dead to us.â€ [audience laughing] â€œGood riddance. We didnâ€™t need her.â€ LeeAnn gets in the wall and he goes, â€œThere goes the brains of the operation!â€ â€œIâ€™m stuck with you three shitheads. Get in the fucking wall.â€ I go, â€œIâ€™m not getting in the wall, Dad.â€ Georgia goes, â€œMake Dad get in the wall.â€ I go, â€œGeorgia, Iâ€™m claustrophobic.â€ Ilaâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s Christmas have to do with this, Dad?â€ â€œShut the fuck up, Ila!â€ [audience laughing] My dadâ€™s like, â€œBuddy, I got bad news for you.â€ â€œYouâ€™re getting in that fucking wall.â€
[audience laughs]
He goes, â€œGirls, you get in first. Big guy, I will be behind you.â€ â€œYou close your eyes. Listen to my voice.â€ â€œIâ€™ll coach you through the wall, and trust me, if you freeze up, I will bulldoze your ass through that fucking wall.â€ [audience laughing] â€œNow, letâ€™s fucking go.â€ And we get in the wall. My daughters, me, my dad. I listened to his voice, like when I was a kid and played baseball. â€œWe got this, big guy.â€ â€œWe can do anything.â€ â€œListen to my voice. We can do this. Me and you. Big team.â€ Nowâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦I donâ€™t know if it wasâ€¦ the angle of my bodyâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦the anxietyâ€¦ that was resting in my stomachâ€¦ or shimmying on all foursâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦but I let out a novel virus fart, likeâ€¦
[audience laughing]
The kind that come out of your ass like hot breath, justâ€¦ [moans] [audience laughing] The kind of farts that escape your body like a curse out of a mummyâ€™s sarcophagus, justâ€¦ [hissing] [audience laughing] The kind of farts that burn your asshole. Just the fart, the air burns your asshole. And you think to yourself, â€œThat was air. Iâ€™m gonna be shitting blood later.â€ [audience laughing] And I release it into my fatherâ€™s mouth human centipede-style. [audience laughing] He goes from coach to cunt real quick. Just, â€œWe got this, big guy!â€ â€œWe canâ€¦ We canâ€¦â€ [groans] [audience laughing] â€œOh fuck, keep going.â€ [groans] â€œWe can do anyâ€¦ [groans] What the fuck?!â€ â€œI think we rolled up on a dead animal.â€ [groans]
[audience laughing]
â€œI think itâ€™s asbestos.â€ [groans] â€œItâ€™s burning my eyes! Keep moving.â€ [groans] â€œI feel like Iâ€™m in the tunnel from Shawshank Redemption.â€ â€œWhy arenâ€™t you moving?â€ [groans] â€œItâ€™s in my skin!â€ â€œItâ€™s burning my cloâ€¦â€ [groans] â€œMove, asshole!â€ I turned around, I go, â€œI canâ€™t. I think Iâ€™m gonna shit.â€ He goes, â€œYou did this?!â€ [audience laughing] â€œYou did this?! I think you gave me cancer!â€ [audience laughing] [groans] â€œI can taste it in my molars! Keep moving!â€ [audience laughing] [groans] My daughters come flying out of that wall the happiest theyâ€™ve ever fucking been. [audience laughing] Go right up to my mom and they go, â€œNana, itâ€™s happening.â€ [audience laughing] I come out of the wall, Iâ€™m like, â€œNana, big guyâ€™s unhappy.â€
[audience laughing]
My dad comes out of that wall like Saddam Hussein out of a spider hole. [audience laughing] â€œCocksucker! Motherfucker!â€ â€œGod! Youâ€™re going to a fucking doctor!â€ [audience laughing] â€œThat is not healthy. That is notâ€¦â€ â€œHe shits like your side of the family, Maggie.â€ â€œYou need a colonoscopy. You need a colonoscopy.â€ â€œThatâ€™s whatâ€™s wrong. Iâ€™m telling you. Where the fuckâ€™s your goddamn wife?â€ [audience laughing] LeeAnn comes out of the rafters of the ceilingâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦and is like, â€œI think I solved the escape room, Albert.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œTry one of the doors.â€ He goes, â€œThe fuck I will!â€ [audience laughs] Grabs the first handle of three on the wall, and it doesnâ€™t move, itâ€™s just locked. [imitates rattle] My daughters now have crossed their legs. Theyâ€™re about to piss their pants. He is at a level nine. â€œMotherfucker!â€ [audience laughs] Grabs the next door. Nothing. â€œCocksucker!â€ Grabs the third door, and as it flies open, he turns his back to the door, looks at us and goes, â€œFucking finally!â€ [audience laughing] He doesnâ€™t see what we seeâ€¦ [audience laughing] which is a 90-year-old woman in her nightgown in a closet. Sheâ€™s been in this closet for 45 minutes. [audience laughing] I donâ€™t know whoâ€™s more scared, her or us.
[audience laughing]
Sheâ€™s trying to adjust her eyes to the light and remember her line. And she just goesâ€¦ [yelling] My dad shuts the doorâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦puts his heel on it, and heâ€™s like, â€œEverybody, back in the fucking wall!â€ [audience laughing] My girls are now on the fucking floor. Georgia looks at me and goes, â€œThis is better than I thought it could have ever been!â€ [audience laughing] My dad looks at me and he goes, â€œWhat the fuck are they talking about?â€ I go, â€œDad, youâ€™re not gonna be happy when you hear this.â€ [audience laughing] â€œBut the only reason they wanted you to comeâ€¦ is for this right now.â€ [audience laughing] He goes, â€œTo solve the escape room?â€ I go, â€œNo, to watch you lose your shit.â€
[audience laughing]
Heâ€™s still standing there, heel on the door. Looks around the room like heâ€™s trying to find someone to love. [audience laughing] Lands on my daughters and he goes, â€œYou wanted this?â€ [audience laughs] â€œThis is what you wanted.â€ Looks at his watch and he goes, â€œMy Apple Watch says my heart rateâ€™s 154.â€ [audience laughing] â€œIâ€™m 75 years old, ladies.â€ [audience laughing] â€œIâ€™m on nine different medications.â€ â€œI got high blood pressure, high cholesterol.â€ â€œYour father just shit in my mouth!â€ [audience laughs] â€œAnd we got the old lady from Titanic locked in a fucking closet!â€ [audience laughing] â€œAnd this is what you wanted?â€ Ila looks at Georgia and goesâ€¦

[audience continue cheering]
[Chris Rock] Whatâ€™s up, Baltimore?
[audience cheers loudly]
Yes! Yes, yes. Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you so much to coming to my Netflix special. Thank you.
[audience cheering]
Thatâ€™s right. Thatâ€™s right! Okay. Iâ€™mma try to do a show.
[man shouting unintelligibly]
Iâ€™mma tryâ€¦ N*gga, sit down! Iâ€™mma try to do a show tonight without offending nobody, okay? Iâ€™mma try my best. You know why? â€˜Cause you never know who might get triggered. Thatâ€™s right. You say the wrong thingâ€¦ motherfuckers get scared. You gotta watch out. You know what people say. They always say, uh, â€œwords hurt.â€ Thatâ€™s what they say. You gotta watch what you say. â€˜Cause words hurt. You know anybody that says words hurt has never been punched in the face.
[audience laughing]
Okay? Yeah, words hurt when you write them on a brick, okay? You gotta watch out.
Everybodyâ€™s scared. Everybody scared. If you a certain age and you go to work, you are fucking scared. In the old days, if somebody wanted your job, they just worked harder than you. Now, somebody wants your job, they just wait for you to say some dumb shit. Yeah. Try to get you with one of them woke traps. Say, â€œHey, we going to a gay wedding tomorrow.â€ â€œHow do you feel about that?â€ Oh, ho, ho, ho! â€œItâ€™s good. Itâ€™s good.â€ Donâ€™t fall into the woke trap at all now.
I have no problem with the wokeness. I have no problem with it at all. Iâ€™m all for social justice. Iâ€™m all for, for marginalized people getting their rights. The thing I have a problem with is the selective outrage.
[audience applauding]
Thatâ€™s right, selective outrage. Everybody, you know what Iâ€™m talking about? One person does something, they get cancelled. Somebody else does the exact same thingâ€¦ No. You know what Iâ€™m talking about. You know, like the kind of people that play Michael Jackson songs, but wonâ€™t play R. Kelly.
[audience laughing and applauding]
[imperceptible]
Same crime. One of them just got better songs. [chuckling] Thatâ€™s right. Well, Iâ€™ll play â€œStartinâ€™ Somethinâ€™,â€ itâ€™s a party. I play â€œBump nâ€™ Grind,â€ now you are activists.
So, everybodyâ€™s scared. Everybody full of shit, you know? Iâ€™m in my old neighborhood the other day. I bumped into my, my good friend, Fred. Hadnâ€™t seen him in years. Hadnâ€™t seen him in years. Fred got a new job at AT&T, okay? So, Iâ€™m like, â€œHey, Fred, howâ€™s the job?â€ And Fredâ€™s like, â€œOh, I love the job.â€ â€œItâ€™s a safe space.â€ â€œI feel seen, I feel heard.â€ â€œThereâ€™s a lot of diversity.â€ And Iâ€™m looking at him. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œN*gga, itâ€™s me.â€ What, you think Iâ€™m wearing a wire or some shit? What the fuck you talking about, safe space? N*gga, you did eight years for manslaughter. Nobodyâ€™s safe around you.
Everybodyâ€™s full of shit. Motherfuckers typing out woke ass tweets on a, on a phone made by child slaves. You need to cut it out, man. Not only is everybody full of shit, not only is everybody full of shit, every business is full of shit. â€“
[man whooping]
Everybody you do business, they donâ€™t even tell you about the product no more. They just tell you how much charity they do. They say, â€œWe give back.â€ â€œWe like to give back.â€ â€œWe donâ€™t even like the money.â€ â€œWe just give back.â€ Iâ€™m in the mall the other day. I went by that store. Whatâ€™s this thing? A Lululemon. Lululemon, I walk by and in the window of every Lululemon, thereâ€™s a sign that says, â€œWe donâ€™t support racism, sexism, discrimination, or hate.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œWho gives a fuck?â€ Youâ€™re just selling yoga pants. I donâ€™t need your yoga pants politics. Tell me how you work on ball sweat. The fuck you talking about, man?
And then, Iâ€™m watching the game the other night. There was aâ€“ There was a commercial for Subaru. Commercial for Subaru, and it said, uh, â€œFor every Subaru we sell, weâ€™ll donate $250 to your favorite charity.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œWho gives a fuck?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œSubaru, you want to help me out?â€ â€œWhy donâ€™t you just sell me the car for $250 less?â€
[audience laughing]
Shit, Iâ€™m my favorite charity. Shit. You know what Elon Musk does? Every time he sells a Tesla, he gets his dick sucked. Thatâ€™s why he looks so weird. â€˜Cause his body has negative cum. Heâ€™s the richest man on Earth. No one has lower cum levels than Elon Musk, okay? Women are sucking out the cum before itâ€™s even formed. Thereâ€™s a six-month waiting list for Elon Muskâ€™s cum. [chuckles] Heâ€™s flying bitches to the moon. Who could compete with that shit? No one has less sperm than Elon Musk. Only Jason Momoa comes close. To having less spunk than Elon Musk. Fucking Lululemon. â€œWe donâ€™t support racism, sexism, discrimination, or hate.â€ They sell $100 yoga pants. $100 yoga pants. They hate somebody.
[laughs]
They hate the poor. [sputters] $100 yoga pants? No, no, no. Correction. They donâ€™t sell $100 yoga pants. They sell $100 non-racist yoga pants. I think I speak for the entire audience tonight when I say most people in this crowd would prefer a pair of $20 racist yoga pants.
[audience cheer in agreement]
Thatâ€™s right. Like, yoga pants that whistled â€œn*ggaâ€ as you walk. â€œN*gga. N*gga. N*gga. N*gga. N*gga.â€ â€œAre my pants whistling, â€˜N*ggaâ€™?â€ â€œCanâ€™t wear these to Cherry Hill.â€
Yeah, we live in Baltimore tonight, baby. We are motherfucking live.
[audience cheering]
Okay? Homework, thatâ€™s right. Whenever I do a show, I do my homework. First thing I do when I get to town, Iâ€™ll go, â€œWhere should I not go?â€ And then I say, â€œWhere can I buy coke?â€ And theyâ€™re usually the same place.
[chuckles] Now, Americaâ€™sâ€¦ Americaâ€™s got problems right now. They say weâ€™re addicted to opioids. They say weâ€™re addicted to opioids and we are. I like a good opioid when I could get my hand on it. [chuckles] Thereâ€™s, like, no pharmacist has ever paid to come to my show.
[laughs]
â€œI think we can get him in there, yeah.â€
Thatâ€™s right, man. They say weâ€™re addicted to opioids, but opioids are not the biggest addiction in America. No. Not even close, man. The biggest addiction in America is attention. Thatâ€™s right. We are addicted to attention. Canâ€™t get enough attention. Feening for likes. Just feening. We used to want love. Now, we just want likes. Posting up pathetic pictures.
[high-pitch voice] â€œThis is me eating sushi. Like me.â€
[chuckling]
â€œThis is me, 25 years ago, when I was hot. Like me.â€
[normal voice] Oh, itâ€™s fucking sad, man. Just feening for attention. Addicted to attention.
And how do you get attention? Four easy ways to get attention.
Number one easiest way to get attention, show your ass. Show your ass! You will get attention, even if you donâ€™t got ass! Thatâ€™s the world we live in. Itâ€™s why Blac Chyna has more followers than Gayle King. â€˜Cause Chyna is showing that ass. Thatâ€™s right. So number one, show your ass.
Number two easiest way to get attention is to be infamous. Yeah. Do some fucked up shit. Shoot up a school. Try to stab Dave Chappelle at a show. Thatâ€™s right, infamy. You will get attention.
Number three easiest way to get attention, thatâ€™s right, to be excellent. Thatâ€™s right. Like Serena Williams, greatest tennis player to ever play the game.
[audience cheering]
Absolutely excellent! Being excellent will get you attention, but itâ€™s hard being excellent. You gotta get up in the morning.
[laughs]
You gotta work out. You gotta practice. It is much easier to show your ass. Thatâ€™s right. Thatâ€™s right.
And the number four easiest way to get attention, number four, is to be a victim.
[audience] Ooh.
Itâ€™s like â€œWhere he going with this?â€
[audience laughs]
Donâ€™t get me wrong, thereâ€™s no victim-shaming going on. No. No, no, no, no. There are real victims in this world. There are people that have gone through unspeakable trauma, and they need your love, your support, and they need your care. But if everybody claims to be a victim when the real victims need help, ainâ€™t nobody gonna be there to help them, okay? And right now, we live in a world where the emergency room is filled up with motherfuckers with paper cuts. Okay?
[audience cheering and whistling]
Thatâ€™s right. Everybodyâ€™s trying to be a victim. People that know good and goddamn well they ainâ€™t victims. Like white men. When did white men become victims? White men actually think theyâ€™re losing the country. To who? It ainâ€™t us. Whenâ€™s the last time you got on a Black cruise ship? Or flew on a Black airline? Get the fuck out of here. We donâ€™t got no money! We got some vodkas and a couple of record companies. White men actually think theyâ€™re losing the country! Can you believeâ€“ Did you see the Capitol riots? White men trying to overthrow the government that they run!
[audience laughing]
The fuck? Theyâ€™re like, â€œWe gotta get them out of office.â€ Who? â€œUs.â€
[laughs]
Did you see the Capitol riots? Like, what kind of white Planet of the Apes shit was that? These motherfuckers are climbing up walls and taking a shit on Pelosiâ€™s desk. What the fuck?
What would make white men think theyâ€™re losing the country? What? What? What? What, â€™cause thereâ€™s no more white couples in commercials? Thereâ€™s no Black couples either. Every commercial has a mixed race couple. Everything! Shit, I saw a commercial the other day, saw a Japanese woman married to a caterpillar. [chuckles] Their kids were squirrels!
By the way, speaking of commercials, when did Snoop Dogg become Morgan Freeman?
[audience laughing and applauding]
This n*ggaâ€™s selling everything. Beer, wine, tamponsâ€¦ I saw a commercial the other day, Snoop was selling reverse mortgages. Called them, â€œDogg-ages.â€ What the fuckâ€™s a â€œDogg-ageâ€?
I love Snoop. I love Snoop Okay, so justâ€¦ Iâ€™m not dissing Snoop, all right? Last thing I need is another mad rapper, right?
[audience laughing]
Nope. Nope, nope. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Back to the show. Everybody is trying to be a victim. Like, whatâ€™s this girl Meghan Markle? [groans] Seemed like a nice lady. Just complaining. I was like, â€œDidnâ€™t she hit the light-skinned lottery?â€ Hit the fucking light-skinned lottery, and still going on complaining. Acting all dumb, like she donâ€™t know nothing. Going on Oprah, [voice breaking] â€œI didnâ€™t know. I had no idea how racist they were.â€ [normal voice] Itâ€™s the royal family. You didnâ€™t google these motherfuckers? [chuckles] What the fuck is she talking about, â€œshe didnâ€™t knowâ€? The fuck? Itâ€™s the royal family! Theyâ€™re the original racists! They invented colonialism! Theyâ€™re the OGs of racism. Theyâ€™re the Sugarhill Gang of racism. Like, â€œThe hip-hop, the hippie, the hippie-dippie hip hip-hop and you donâ€™t stopâ€ of racism. The fuck is she talking about, â€œI didnâ€™t knowâ€? Thatâ€™s like marrying into the Budweiser family and going, â€œThey drink a lot!â€ The fuck is she talking about? These motherfuckers invested in slavery like it was Shark Tank. [laughs] The fuck? She said, â€œTheyâ€™re so racist. Theyâ€™re so racist.â€
Some of that shit she went through was not racism! It was just some in-law shit. And sometimes itâ€™s just some in-law shit! â€˜Cause sheâ€™s complaining, and Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuck is she talking about?â€ [voice breaking] â€œOprah, theyâ€™re so racist!â€ â€œThey wanted to know how brown the baby was gonna be.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re so racist. They wanted to know how brown the babyâ€™s gonna be.â€ [normal voice] Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s not racist!â€ â€˜Cause even Black people wanna knowâ€¦
[audience laughing and applauding]
â€¦how brown the baby gonna be! Shit, we check behind them ears. Thatâ€™s a scientific test. [chuckles] â€˜Cause you gotta see what kind of Black child youâ€™re gonna get. Is this a Steph Curry baby? Or a Draymond Green baby? That Draymond baby gonna have a hard life. Draymond Black, baby. That n*gga dark. Heâ€™s â€œsneak-up-on-youâ€ Black. Where you at, Draymond? â€œRight here.â€ Hey! Hey! Put a bell on, n*gga! Put a bell!
I know what she going through. I know what Meghan Markleâ€™s going through. I-I know her dilemma. Black girl trying to be accepted by her white in-laws. Oh, itâ€™s hard. Black girl trying to be accepted by her white in-laws. Itâ€™s so hard. Itâ€™s very hard! But it ainâ€™t as hard as a white girl trying to be accepted by her Black in-laws. Now, that shit is really hard. Shit, you bring a white girl home for Thanksgiving, your momma gonna say something. Your mommaâ€™s like, â€œWhy is there a social worker at the table?â€ Like, â€œMomma, thatâ€™s Jackie!â€ â€œWeâ€™ve been married nine years!â€ â€œYou got three grandchildren! Stop being so mean!â€ â€œYou know Iâ€™m playing, right, Jackie? Just give me time.â€ Nah, nah, nah.
Meghan Markle, I know the dilemma. Black girl trying to be accepted by her white in-laws. Black girl trying to be accepted by her white in-laws. Iâ€™m like, â€œHey! If youâ€™re Black, and you wanna be accepted by your white in-laws, then you need to marry a Kardashian.â€ â€˜Cause they accept everybody. So, like, Kris Jenner is like the Statue of Liberty. â€œGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled massesâ€¦â€ Kris Jenner lets everybody in. Thatâ€™s right. Sheâ€™s like a Black grandma. She just wants to fix you up a plate, that Kris Jenner. She donâ€™t give a fuck. She lets everybody in. Sheâ€™s like, â€œBipolar rapper? Bring your ass in here.â€ â€œCome in here, you genius, bipolar motherfucker.â€ â€œCrackhead basketball player? Bring your ass here.â€ â€œLet me fix you up a plate, you old crackhead.â€ â€œDaddy got titties? Bring your ass here.â€ â€œHelp me with these plates.â€ [laughs] The Kardashians are inclusive! And they love Black people more than Black people love Black people. Shit, the father freed O.J.
[audience laughing]
Oh, you forgot that little nugget of Black history? He was a, he was a valuable member of the Dream Team. Thatâ€™s right. He wasnâ€™t Johnnie Cochran. He was the Klay Thompson of that team. Thatâ€™s right. Thatâ€™s right. Robert Kardashian helped to free O.J. Simpson, a Black, football playing murderer! Whoo! O.J. Simpson killed two white people and got away with it. Thatâ€™s another kind of Black excellence. Thatâ€™s way before Wakanda. Ah, ha, ha!
Yes. Robert Kardashian helped to free O.J. Simpson. Thatâ€™s right. And from that day on, from the day that he helped to free O.J. Simpson, from the time O.J. Simpson left that courtâ€¦ From that day on, Robert Kardashian was cursed. Thatâ€™s right. The judge said, â€œNot guilty.â€ O.J. left the court, got in his Bronco, drove away. And soon as O.J. drove away, God appeared. And God walked up to Robert Kardashian and God said, â€œRobert Kardashian!â€ â€œFor the sin of helping to free O.J. Simpson, a Black, football-playing murderer, from this day forth, for the rest of eternity, till the end of time, your daughters will fuck nothing but n*ggas!â€
[audience laughing]
â€œAnd not just any n*ggas, crazy n*ggas.â€ â€œThe craziest n*ggas to ever live.â€
[laughs]
Yeah, we going in tonight. You canâ€™t tell none of these jokes at work, motherfucker. No!
I love the Kardashians. I love the Kardashians. Theyâ€™re a very tight-knit family. Iâ€“ You know what I love about the Kardashians? I love how quickly they accepted Caitlyn. I thought that was beautiful. I thought it was beautiful. Thatâ€™s right. â€œNo muss, no fuss, sheâ€™s with us.â€ I thought it was beautiful. I would love to believe that if my father became a woman, that we would accept the situation as fast as the Kardashians. And Iâ€™m sure we would. Iâ€™m sure we would. It wouldnâ€™t be the first season. [chuckling] You know, we need a few episodes to make this shit happenâ€“
No, no, no. No, no. Honestly, hereâ€™s the deal. If my father became a woman, I would accept it right away. I would accept it right away. You know why? â€˜Cause Iâ€™m an artist. And Iâ€™ve worked with all sort of people, got nothing against anybody. Trans, Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s trans people here. I got no beef with anybody. Iâ€™m gonna accept everyone, right?
[man whoops]
Thatâ€™s right. If my father became a woman, Iâ€™d accept it. I mean, to be perfectly honestâ€¦ To be perfectly honest, in some situations I actually prefer trans women to original recipe. Like, when youâ€™re watching a game they could read defenses. â€œThatâ€™s a Cover 2.â€ â€œOoh, thanks, Peaches.â€ No! [guffaws] No, no, no.
Again, if my father became a woman, I would accept it â€™cause Iâ€™m an artist and I would accept it immediately. Now, my brothers drive trucks. So, their reaction might be a little different than mine. Especially my older brother, Andre. He, you know, drives an 18-wheeler, is a Raiders fan. Heâ€™s one of them â€œarghâ€ n*ggas, you know? If my father became a woman, Andre would have a problem with it. That would be a very testy Christmas to say the least. My brother Andre would be like, â€œMan, fuck that shit, man!â€ â€œThe fuck, you got the heels on?â€ â€œThe fuck you doing? You donâ€™t gotta wear a motherfucking heel.â€ â€œWhy the wig? What that got to do with nothinâ€™?â€ â€œWhat the hair got to do with nothinâ€™?â€ â€œNah, I ainâ€™t shaking your hand.â€ â€œI donâ€™t want none of that trans to rub off on me.â€ â€œMy kids here, n*gga, my kids!â€
And then, I would have to step in and be the voice of reason. I would have to check my brother. I would have to walk up to him going, â€œHey! Hey!â€ â€œHey, n*gga!â€ â€œSheâ€™s your daddy!â€
[laughs]
We gotta love everybody, man. We gotta love all. America, Americaâ€™s in bad shape right now, man. Americaâ€™s in horrible shape. We got it worse than Ukraine. Yeah, I said it. You know why? â€˜Cause Ukraine is united and America is clearly divided. Okay? We are clearly divided. Our shit is so screwed up right now, if the Russians came here right now, half the country would go, â€œLetâ€™s hear â€™em out.â€ We in a bad place, man. Republicans lie. Republicans lie. Biggest liars in the world. Republicans lie, and Democrats leave out key pieces of the truthâ€¦
[audience cheering and whistling]
â€¦that would lead to a more nuanced argument. The whole country is fucked up. School shootings every week. Fucking opioid epidemic. Abortion is illegal in most of the country. In most of the country, abortionâ€™s illegal. A lot of people say, â€œChris, you shouldnâ€™t talk about abortion.â€ â€œItâ€™s a womenâ€™s issue.â€ Say, â€œChris! You shouldnâ€™t talk about abortion.â€ â€œItâ€™s a womenâ€™s issue.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œHey.â€ â€œIâ€™ve paid for more abortions than any woman in this room.â€ Shit, when I go to the clinic, I say, â€œGimme the usual.â€ When I go in there, they give me a punch card. â€œHere you go.â€ Two more and I get a free smoothie. â€œMango.â€
Thatâ€™s right, pro-life, pro-choice. Pro-life, pro-choice, what are you, what are you? I have two beautiful daughters. I have two beautiful daughters, right? Andâ€¦ So, thereâ€™s a part of meâ€¦ Thereâ€™s a part of me thatâ€™s pro-life, okay? â€˜Cause Iâ€™m definitely pro their lives. Okay? So, thereâ€™s a part of me thatâ€™s pro-life. But since I love my daughters unconditionallyâ€“ I love them not just as little girls, I love them as grown women. I want my daughters to live in a world where they have complete control of their bodies, okay?
[audience cheering]
Okay? And because of that, I am pro-choice. I am absolutely pro-choice, okay? I believe women should have the right to kill babies.
[scattered laughs]
Thatâ€™s right. Iâ€™m on your side. I believe you should have the right to kill as many babies as you want. Kill â€™em all, I donâ€™t give a fuck. But letâ€™s not get it twisted, it is killing a baby. â€˜Cause whenever I pay for an abortion, I request a dead baby. Sometimes, I call up the doctor like a hit man. â€œIs it done?â€
[laughs]
And people argue first trimester, second trimester. First trimester, second trimester. I think women should have the right to kill a baby until itâ€™s four years old. Thatâ€™s right, fuck trimester. Semester. I think you should be able to kill a baby till you get that first report card. [exclaims] â€œHe ainâ€™t never getting a scholarship.â€ â€œOkay, you can finish watching Stranger Things, but when itâ€™s over, we going to the clinic.â€ â€œHurry up, Iâ€™m trying to get a smoothie.â€
Thatâ€™s right. Pro-life, pro-choice. Iâ€™m pro-choice. Iâ€™m pro-choice. Iâ€™m pro right choice. Iâ€™m pro good choice. Iâ€™m pro practical choice. Like, ladiesâ€¦ Ladies, listen to me. If you have to pay for your own abortion, you should get an abortion. Stop letting broke dicks cum inside of you. This has been a public service announcement. Iâ€™m on your side! Iâ€™m on your side.
Everybody cares about abortion, trying to save these bad-ass kids. You know, whenever some kid goes crazy at a school, they always say, â€œNo childâ€¦ No child is born is racist.â€ â€œNo child is born hating.â€ â€œYou have to teach a child to hate. All children are good.â€ â€œAll children are born pure.â€
You know, only people without kids say dumb shit like that. Kids are the meanest motherfuckers on the face of the earth. Theyâ€™re the most racist, sexist, homophobic, fat-a-phobic, will-say-anything-to-your-face motherfuckers on Earth, okay?
You realize human beings, we have the worst offspring of any animal. Weâ€™re the only animal in the whole animal kingdom that has to raise its kids for 18 years. Eighteen years. Every other animalâ€™s like two or three days. Like, birds are like, â€œI hope you can fly.â€
[chuckles]
Eighteen years! And they still bad! And they still fuck up. â€œNo, kids are born good.â€ Shut the fuck up, man. My oldest daughter, Lola, used to bite kids. Bite â€™em. Thatâ€™s right. Youâ€™d be at a birthday party. â€œHappy birthday toâ€¦â€ [yelps in pain] You look around, Lola done bit somebody.
Now, let me ask you something. Do you think me and her mother taught her to bite? Do you think me and her mother sharpened her teeth? Do you think we bought her mannequins to practice on? No, thatâ€™s just who the fuck she is. Thatâ€™s just her nature. She came out the womb like Wolverine.
I love my kids. I love my kids, but I donâ€™t like them. I donâ€™t like my kids. You know one reason I donâ€™t like my kids? â€˜Cause my kids are rich. My kids are rich and spoiled. I know some people are like, â€œChris, youâ€™re rich.â€ Yeah, Iâ€™m rich. But I identify as poor.
[audience laughing and applauding]
[man] Whoo!
Thatâ€™s right, my pronoun is broke. Thatâ€™s right, man. And my kids are spoiled. My kids are fucking spoiled and I did it. Me and their mother, but I fucking did it. A lot, a lot of Black people get a little money, and theyâ€™re like, â€œI want my kids to know how it is in the hood.â€ Not me. I want the exact opposite. I want my kids to know shit about the hood. I want them to be lost every time theyâ€™re in a hood, okay? My kids went to the best schools on Earth, okay? My kids speak multiple languages, okay? Sometimes they curse me out, I donâ€™t even know what they talkinâ€™ about. My kids ski, they ride horses, they fence. Iâ€™ve got fencing Black girls, with afro puffs, talking about, â€œTouchÃ©, n*gga.â€
Thatâ€™s right. You canâ€™t fuck with the Rock girls, boy. Them Rock girls are fucking spoiled. I remember my youngest, Zahra, when she was in kindergarten, one day, the teacher said, â€œToday, weâ€™re gonna learn about the four seasons.â€ And Zahra said, â€œThatâ€™s my favorite hotel.â€
[laughs]
Yeah, you ainâ€™t never seen Black girls like this. My kids are fucking spoiled. Thatâ€™s right. And I did it, man. When they were little kids, I used to take them to Disney a lot. Used to take them to Disney all the time, right? But I ainâ€™t take them like normal people, no. Thatâ€™s right. We went on the Illuminati package. We werenâ€™t out there waiting to meet the characters, like everybody else. We were backstage chilling with the characters. Thatâ€™s right. I smoked a joint with Goofy. Fucking Minnie gave me a lap dance. Rubbed that big rat ass on me. Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Thatâ€™s right, man. My kids had it good. Had it much better than me. â€˜Cause when I was a kid, we went to Disney. Thatâ€™s right. Me, my mother, and my brothers, we went to Disney as poor people. On a church trip. [chuckling] Sad already, ainâ€™t it? On a church trip. New York to Orlando, in August, on a bus with no AC. It was so hot, I thought we were going to see the Devil. Took us two days to get there, â€™cause the driver was selling weed on the way. And when we finally got there, we werenâ€™t really there, â€™cause Disneyâ€™s in Orlando, and our hotel was in Alabama. And weâ€™re staying in some nasty motel. It had a bed that vibrates if you put a quarter in it. Weâ€™re little kids. We donâ€™t know this is a nasty, cummed-up mattress. And weâ€™re begging my mother, â€œMommy, can you put another quarter in?â€ And my motherâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m gonna put a quarter in, but this counts as a ride.â€ [chuckling] God damn. Best time of my life.
Now, my kids, my kids, yes, theyâ€™re spoiled. Yes, they are spoiled, but they get in trouble just like any other kids. So about three years ago, my oldest, Lola, was a senior in high school, right? And they went on a class trip. It was time for a class trip. Now, a fancy school has a fancy trip. So their class trip was to Portugal. Ainâ€™t that some shit? Portugal. When I was a kid, we went to the Bronx Zoo. Watched a gorilla jerk off. And then had to write a report about it. â€œHe held it tightly.â€
So Lola goes on the class trip, and sheâ€™s in Portugal, doing whatever Portuguese shit they do. And one day, Lola, and four of her little white girl friends decide that theyâ€™re bored and theyâ€™re gonna leave the class. Theyâ€™re gonna sneak away, go to a bar, and get drunk. And then they tried to sneak back in. But of course, they got busted. Of course, they got busted. Now, these crazy, rich, white schools, they donâ€™t play that shit. You get busted sneaking out drinking, theyâ€™re like, â€œYou are kicked out.â€ Butâ€¦ But, this school, of course, these crazy white schools got rich-ass white parents. And rich-ass white parents do not let their kids get kicked out of school. So all these rich-ass parents, theyâ€™ve all got lawyers. Even the ones that were lawyers, got lawyers. Okay? And they got them good lawyers. They got those NFL rape lawyers. Like, Iâ€™m not advocating rape. But if youâ€™re ever on trial, thatâ€™s who you want, okay? Either that, or Robert Kardashian, right?
And they got the good lawyers, right? I didnâ€™t want a lawyer at first. I didnâ€™t want to get a lawyer because I was mad at my child. I was mad. I was like, â€œLola, what the fuck is going on?â€ â€œFirst, youâ€™re biting. Now, this shit?â€ And I tried to talk to my ex-wife. I was like, â€œLetâ€™s wait before we get a lawyer.â€ â€œLetâ€™s see how this turns out. Letâ€™s see how it unfolds.â€ My ex-wifeâ€™s like, â€œNo, fuck that.â€ â€œWeâ€™re getting a lawyer, and weâ€™re gonna sue this school.â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna sue this dean. Weâ€™re gonna sue these teachers.â€ â€œI canâ€™t even believe they let her out of their sight.â€ â€œWe are suing these people.â€
And I started to argue with her, but the last time I argued with my ex-wife about a lawyer, I lost my house. So we got a lawyer. We got a lawyer. And Iâ€™m talking to the lawyer, and the lawyerâ€™s like, â€œOkay, okay, I talked to some people.â€ â€œAnd if you give me ten days, I should be able to get her back in the school.â€ So Lolaâ€™s home for ten days. One day, I come home from work and I see Lola outside just laughing with, like, three of her little white girl friends, just laughing. You ever just want to choke your child for smiling? Like, motherfucker, what are you smiling about right now? So I walk over to Lola. Iâ€™m like, â€œLola, whatâ€™s so funny?â€ â€œWhat is so funny?â€ And Lolaâ€™s like, â€œDaddy, stop it!â€ â€œYouâ€™re so serious. Iâ€™ll be back in school in no time.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œLook at this smug motherfucker.â€ And at that moment, I kind of snapped. And I got back in the car. I got back in the fucking car and I drove to the school. I drove to the school and found the dean. I was like, â€œHey, we need to talk.â€ â€œI know youâ€™re going through it right now.â€ â€œI know youâ€™ve got a lot of parents trying to sue you, and trying to sue the school, and trying to get you fired, but I need a favor.â€ â€œI need you to kick my daughter out of this school.â€ â€œI need you to kick her Black ass out of this school.â€ â€œI need my Black child to learn her lesson right now, before she ends up on OnlyFans or some shit.â€ â€œPlease kick my child out of fucking school.â€
And they kicked her out. They kicked them all out, but they kicked my child out first, okay? â€˜Cause Iâ€™m a celebrity. And I went home, act like I didnâ€™t know what was about to happen. The phone rang. I was like, â€œLola, you should get that.â€ I act like I didnâ€™t know shit. And Lola got the phone and they gave her the news. And then Lola comes in all sad. [crying] â€œDaddy, they kicked me out of school.â€ And I was like, â€œI told you them crackers are mean, Lola.â€ â€œI told you about them crackers.â€ And to this day, Lola has no idea I had anything to do with that shit. And her mother has no idea I had anything to do with that shit. And the lawyer has no idea. And they wonâ€™t find out till they see this shit on Netflix.
[audience cheering]
Hereâ€™s the amazing thing. Hereâ€™s a beautiful thing that happened. Hereâ€™s a beautiful thingâ€¦ It worked. The whole thing humbled Lola, my God, â€™cause Lola got kicked out of school for real. So she had to apply to another high school, and she had to write essays explaining why she got kicked out, and why it would never happen again. And when it was time for her to apply for college, she had to write why she got kicked out, and why it would never happen again. And now, three years later, my daughter, Lola, is one of the coolest people I have ever met. She is so amazing.
[audience applauding]
Lola Rock is amazing. My daughter, Lola, goes to culinary school in Paris. Yeah. Culinary school. TouchÃ©, n*gga, touchÃ©. Culinary school in Paris. Thatâ€™s right. My greatest achievement, man. I mean, letâ€™s just think about it. Letâ€™s just think about it for a second. My mother was born in 1945. My mother was born in 1945, in a little town called Georgetown, South Carolina, right? And my mother told me when she was a little girl, it was against the law for a Black person to go to a white dentist. Against the law for a Black person to go to a white dentist, right? And if you were a little child and you needed your teeth taken out, like all children do, if youâ€™re a little Black child and you needed your teeth taken out, and you couldnâ€™t find a Black dentist, you had to go to a vet. Yeah, motherfucker. A vet in America. Iâ€™m talking about my mother. Iâ€™m not talking about Harriet Tubman. Iâ€™m talking about my mother. Shit, sheâ€™s sitting over there, okay?
[audience cheering]
My mother went to a vet, okay? Went to a vet. And think about it. The same woman that had to go through the indignity of getting her teeth taken out by a fucking vet, the same woman now, twice a year, gets on a plane, flies to Paris, and has coffee with her granddaughter, who is going to culinary school. TouchÃ©, n*gga, touchÃ©. Okay? And Lola, and my mother, my mother sits her down and tells her about her life, and then Lola bites her. Yes. TouchÃ©, n*gga, touchÃ©.
Oh, my life is good. I cannot complain, man. Cannot complain. You know, I got some bullshit going on, but itâ€™s going good. Iâ€™m single. Iâ€™m single. Have been single a long time. I was married for a long time, you know, I was dating somebody for a while. Now Iâ€™m single and hereâ€™s the crazy thing. You donâ€™t even realize all the amazing little things a woman does for you â€™til you donâ€™t have one. You donâ€™t even realize â€™em. Women do so many things that you donâ€™t even realize. Like the other night, Iâ€™m trying to get some sleep trying to sleep, couldnâ€™t sleep, trying to sleep, couldnâ€™t sleep. And suddenly it dawned on me, I was like, â€œThis pillowcase is filthy.â€ â€œAre we supposed to change these?â€ I flipped it over it was black and greasy. I was like, â€œDid Draymond Green sleep on this part of the bed?â€ That shit was black, man.
Yeah. Try to date. Trying to fucking date is hard. â€˜Cause on one hand, you know, Iâ€™m loving, I want a real relationship. â€œI want a Sunday kind of love.â€ And the other time, on the other hand, Iâ€™m just a ho. Iâ€™m just bad. Iâ€™m like, â€œAh, fuck all this shit.â€ Like Iâ€™m all fucked up, we all got that. Like, ladies, I will lick your ass and never call you again. But if we hold hands, you my girl. Why is that? Why is holding hands more intimate than licking ass? That donâ€™t make no sense. Iâ€™m doing the Netflix special tonight, Iâ€™m making a ton of money, I might lick somebodyâ€™s ass tonight. But I know, I ainâ€™t holding nobodyâ€™s hand. I know that shit. [laughs] I canâ€™t tell you every woman I fucked, but I know every hand I ever held.
Iâ€™m trying to date, trying to date. Trying to date women my age, which is 10 to 15 years younger than me. Donâ€™t hate the player, hate the game. Youâ€™re right. I didnâ€™t get rich and stay in shape to talk about Anita Baker.
[laughs]
Iâ€™m trying to fuck Doja Cat. [guffaws] Yeah, n*gga, yeah. No, man, a lot of people think men date younger women â€™cause theyâ€™re younger. No, not at all. Men do not date younger women â€™cause theyâ€™re younger. Men date younger women â€™cause theyâ€™re less expensive to date. That is what it all boils down to. See, you go out with a 25-year-old, she just wants a pair of shoes.
[imitating a woman] â€œI saw these shoes. Can I get these shoes?â€ â€œI saw these shoes. Can I get these shoes?â€ â€œI really like these shoes. Can I get these shoes?â€ â€œCan I send you the link?â€ â€œCan I send you the link?â€ â€œI want to get these shoes. Can I get these shoes?â€ â€œYou can Venmo me.â€ â€œThatâ€™s the app I put on your phone three weeks ago.â€ â€œCan I get these shoes?â€
[normal voice] And if youâ€™re lucky, your 25-year-old will model those shoes for you. Thatâ€™s right. You go, â€œFuck it. Get your shoes.â€ And if youâ€™re lucky, she will model them for you naked. Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou like your shoes, Daddy?â€ â€œYou like your shoes?â€
[imitating a woman] â€œYou like your shoes, Daddy?â€ â€œYou like your shoes?â€
[normal voice] And everybodyâ€™s happy for the price of a pair of shoes. Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s like to date a 25 year old. You go out with a 45, 50? They want more than shoes. [chuckles] You go out with a 45, 50-year-old, sheâ€™s like, â€œCan you help me fix my roof?â€
[audience laughs]
Goddamn. That ainâ€™t sexy at all. What, I got to get estimates for this pussy? I got to see contractors for this pussy, goddamn. [laughs] You go out with a 45, 50-year-old, they got a house thatâ€™s falling apart. Theyâ€™re like, â€œYou know anybody with a snake?â€ A snake? You donâ€™t want my dick to ever get hard.
You go out with a 45, 50-year-old, they always got a car thatâ€™s falling apart. Carâ€™s a piece of shit. They always got the worst version of a good car. The car got a good name, but they got the worst version they ever made. Like a Mercedes 308. What the fuckâ€™s a 308? Four-cylinder and you roll the window down? Who sold you this shit? They got a Tesla that takes gas. Youâ€™re like, â€œWho sold you this shit?â€ What the fuck?
God, man, but the pussy good. The pussy, that 45, 50-year-old pussy, itâ€™s good. Thatâ€™s right, it simmered longer. Itâ€™s been on the pot a little longer. Thatâ€™s right, that 45, 50-year-old pussy is like spaghetti. Itâ€™s better the next day. It really is, really is. Whoo! It really fucking is.
And they always got a fucked up car then you get that good pussy. You get that good 45, 50-year-old pussy you think you leaving the house, â€œOkay, see you later.â€ And then sheâ€™s like, â€œNo, no, no, no, no. I need a favor.â€ â€œCan you come with me to the mechanic to pick up my car?â€ â€œI need you to come â€™cause if I go alone theyâ€™re gonna take advantage.â€
So now you gotta go with her to pick up her car. You donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s wrong with the car. But you gotta go. And you just standing there like some sort of sexual scarecrow.
[chuckling]
[man whoops]
And the mechanicâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s $500,â€ and youâ€™re likeâ€¦ [screeches] And then the mechanic says, â€œOkay, $450.â€ And then she goes, â€œI only got $35.â€ Bitch, you fucking played me! I just got your roof fixed.
They say women have all, they say men have all the power. They say men have all the power. But we donâ€™t. We donâ€™t have all the power. Women have the power. You got all the fucking power.
[scattered applause]
Thatâ€™s right. â€˜Cause thereâ€™s nothing more powerful than female beauty. Nothing more powerful, thatâ€™s right. A beautiful woman can stop traffic. There is nothing about a man that can stop traffic. Now, thatâ€™s right. You could be a dead man on a highway with your dick out and they will drive around your dead ass.
Thereâ€™s nothing [chuckling] more powerful than female beauty. You call it female beauty, you can call it pussy. Call it whatever you want, man. Shit, Iâ€™ve been working, Iâ€™ve been working since I was seven years old. Been working for almost 50 years. Seven years old! I used to sweep up at a supermarket. Iâ€™ve been working since I was seven years old. And I have made millions of dollars, okay? And every dime I have ever made I have spent it on pussy. Every fucking cent! Either pussy or pussy adjacent. Every fucking dime. Getting the pussy hair done, getting the pussy taxes done, getting the pussyâ€™s son into camp, getting the pussyâ€™s tooth fixed, getting the pussyâ€™s driveway done, getting the pussyâ€™s mama some life insurance, getting the pussy bunion surgery. Iâ€™ve paid more college loans off than Joe Biden. Motherfucker. Spent all my money on pussy. And if I had a chance to do it again Iâ€™d spend it on pussy again.
They say men have all the advantages. No, we donâ€™t. Thatâ€™s right, man. Women you got all the advantages. You ever notice how you can tell what kind of neighborhood you in? Just by whoâ€™s not working? Think about it for one sec, you can tell what kind of neighborhood you in just by whoâ€™s not working. If youâ€™re in any neighborhood in America, at 12:15 in the afternoon on a Wednesday, and you see women with sweatpants on coming out the gym, pushing babies, riding bikes. Thatâ€™s right, having brunch, going to SoulCycle. Chances are youâ€™re in a nice neighborhood. Thereâ€™s probably a Whole Foods nearby.
Thatâ€™s right, wherever women ainâ€™t working is an amazing place to live. Thatâ€™s where I want to live. I want to live in a place where women are voluntarily not working. That is where I want to live.
Now, letâ€™s switch it up. If youâ€™re in any neighborhood in America, at 12:15 in the afternoon on a Wednesday, and you see men in sweatpants, smoking cigarettes, hanging with their boys, lifting weights in the yard, riding childrenâ€™s bicycles, as their actual transportation, then you are in danger. Wherever men donâ€™t work is fucking dangerous, thatâ€™s right. Thatâ€™s right, thatâ€™s right, women have all the power, shit. My ex-wife is the smartest woman I know. She got just as much money as me ainâ€™t funny at all.
[man whoops]
[Chris Rock laughs]
God bless her. God bless her.
Nothing more powerful than female beauty. Nothing. Just look at BeyoncÃ©. Whoo! Canâ€™t wait for that tour. Thatâ€™s right, man, BeyoncÃ©. Now I know she talented. She is so talented, man. Sheâ€™s extremely talented. But even with all that talent ainâ€™t nothing more powerful than the beauty. BeyoncÃ© is one of the finest motherfuckers I have ever seen. BeyoncÃ© is fine, motherfucker. Shit. BeyoncÃ© is so fine that if she worked at Burger King she could still marry Jay-Z. [chuckling] Thatâ€™s how fine she is. She could still get her a billionaire, great, rapping, fucking businessman. She is so fine that if she worked at Burger King, she could still marry Jay-Z. Now if Jay-Z worked at Burger Kingâ€¦
[audience laughs]
No, no, no, women got the power. By the way, that is not a Jay-Z diss. I do not need another rapper mad at me, okay? I donâ€™t need it. I donâ€™t need that smoke. [chuckles] Iâ€™m, like, The Rock. The Rock. I do not need the smoke. Yâ€™all know what happened to me. Getting smacked by Suge Smith. Everybody knows. Everybody fucking knows. Yes! It happened. I got smacked like a year ago, fucking last week, I got smacked at the fucking Oscars by this motherfucker. And people like, â€œDid it hurt?â€ It still hurts. I got â€œSummertimeâ€ ringing in my ear. Fucking drums, please.
But Iâ€™m not a victim, baby. You will never see me on Oprah or Gayle crying. You will never see it. Never gonna happen.
[whimpering] I couldnâ€™t believe it and I love Men in Black.
[normal voice] No. Itâ€™s never gonna happen. No. Fuck that shit. I took that hit like Pacquiao, motherfucker.
[audience cheering]
I took it like motherfucking Pacquiao, okay? Shit, man. Did it hurt? Yeah, it motherfucking hurt. People are all, â€œYou guys are fighting all the time.â€ Weâ€™re not fighting. First of all, I know you canâ€™t tell on camera. Will Smith is significantly bigger than me. Weâ€™re not the same size, okay? Weâ€™re not. This guy mostly does movies with his shirt off. Youâ€™ve never seen me do a movie with my shirt off. If Iâ€™m in a movie getting open heart surgery, I got on a sweater. Will Smith played Muhammad Ali in a movie. You think I auditioned for that part? He played Muhammad Ali. I played Pookie in New Jack City.
[audience cheering]
Pookie, motherfucker. I played a piece of corn in Pootie Tang. Shit, even in animation, this motherfucker is bigger. I am zebra. Heâ€™s a shark. What the fuck, man? Butâ€¦ But, Will Smith practices selective outrage. Practices selective outrage. â€˜Cause everybody knows what the fuck happened. Everybody that really knows knows that I had nothing to do with that shit. I didnâ€™t have any entanglement.
[audience cheering]
I didnâ€™t. I did not have any entanglement. For people that donâ€™t know what everybody knows. Will Smith, his wife was fucking her sonâ€™s friend, okay? Now, I normally would not talk about this shit. But for some reason, these n*ggas put that shit on the Internet. I have no idea why two talented people would do something that fucking low down. What the fuck? We all been cheated on. Everybody in here had been cheated on. None of us have ever been interviewed by the person that cheated on us on television. None of us. Itâ€™s like, â€œHey, I was sucking somebody elseâ€™s dick.â€ â€œHow did that make you feel?â€
Why the fuck would you do that shit? She hurt him way more than he hurt me. Okay? Okay? And by the way, he does that shit, everybody in the world called him a bitch. I tried to call the motherfucker and give him my condolences. He ainâ€™t pick up for me. Everybody called that man a bitch. Fucking Charlamagne called him a bitch. The Breakfast Club called him a bitch. And The View and The Talk and every rapper and the Drink Champs called him a fucking bitch. Everybody called him a bitch and called his wife a predator. Everybody called him a bitch. Everybody! Everybody! And who does he hit? Me. A n*gga he know he could beat. That is some bitch-ass shit.
[audience cheering]
Thatâ€™s what the fuck happened, okay? Get the fuck out of here, man. What the fuck? I do nothing to this motherfucker, okay? Whatever. Years ago, his wife said I should quit the Oscars. I shouldnâ€™t host. She fucking said, â€œHe should quit â€™cause Will didnâ€™t get nominated for Concussion.â€ What the fuck? What the fuck? So then I do some jokes about her. Who gives a fuck? Thatâ€™s how it is. She started it. I finished it. Okay? Thatâ€™s what the fuck happened. Nobody was picking on this bitch. She started this shit. Nobody was picking on her. Nobody was picking on her. She said, me, a fucking grown-ass man should quit his job â€™cause her husband didnâ€™t get nominated for Concussion. And then this n*gga gives me a fucking concussion, okay?
What the fuck, man? I love Will Smith. My whole life, I love this n*gga. I saw him opened up for Run-DMC at the Nassau Coliseum. These n*ggas made brand-new funk. I love this n*gga. He made some great movies. Iâ€™ve rooted for Will Smith my whole life. I root for this motherfucker, okay? And now, I watch Emancipation just to see him get whooped. It got me rooting for Massa, okay? Hit him again, Massa. Hit him again! You missed a spot, Massa. You missed a spot.
A lot of people go, â€œChris, how come you didnâ€™t do nothing back.â€ â€œHow come you didnâ€™t do nothing back that night?â€ â€˜Cause I got parents. Thatâ€™s why. â€˜Cause I was raised, okay? Iâ€™ve got parents. You know what my parents taught me. Donâ€™t fight in front of white people.

[siren wailing]
I donâ€™t know what you were thinking.
Like, Iâ€™m not nervous, really. All Iâ€™m thinking isâ€“I think it looks good out there. I think Iâ€™ve gotâ€“ it was a good choice to do it in that small venue. I didnâ€™t want a theater, because that doesnâ€™t seem to be where you do comedy, running back and forth, trying to be larger than you really are. But now Iâ€™m starting to think maybe itâ€™s just all done out of complete fear. Like, why not just have 12 people and shoot it very tightly and then err on the side of performance art if things donâ€™t work out the way I want it to?
Youâ€™re at a nice place now where you can have more than 12 people.
Thereâ€™s, like, 70. Maybe 100. 150. I donâ€™t know. My stomach hurts. Badly. And Iâ€™ve been nauseous all day. I think I should be happy about all this, though, right?
This is exciting. This is the best. Oh, my God. This isâ€“for you, this is such a big year. Think of what you would have done to have this year ten years ago.
Oh, I would have ruined it at the beginning of it.
But if somebody would have laid outâ€“ itâ€™s like, â€œHereâ€™s the year you could have. What would you do for that year?â€
I often think about that. If I would have gotten the opportunities I have now when I was 20, thereâ€™s no way. I was notâ€“like, thatâ€™s one of the great ways to alleviate any sort of bitterness you have in your life, is to really be honest with yourself and think, â€œCould I have handled this then?â€ Thereâ€™d be no way. Thereâ€™d be no way I could have handled it. I would have ruined it. People would have been disappointed. That could still happen. Tonight it could still happen.
But isnâ€™t that the best part of it, in a way, knowing that itâ€™s yours toâ€“ you could press the button any time you wantâ€“
And just fuck it up?
Blow it all up again. Youâ€™d be all the way back at the beginning.
Yeah. The stakes are higher if you blow it further along.
No, this would be the worst you could do right now.
This is the best pep talk Iâ€™ve ever had.
Because itâ€™s finally lined up, everything.
Everythingâ€™s about to happen.
Exactly.
But thatâ€™s another benefit of the small audience. Like, so the disaster, itâ€™s limited. Only a certain number of people could tweet that itâ€™s going bad during the show. â€œMaron not quite getting over.â€
#MaronFail.
[laughs] Thatâ€™s a good way to start. You ready to go? We ready to go? Want to go do it? You want to bring me onstage?
Yeah, sure.
Can you believe we just did that? Like, this is how we prepared for me to go onstage? That this is it?
You squeezed in a small podcast.
I squeezed in a smallâ€¦
All right.
Oh, my goodness. I feel the presence of alcohol. [indistinct chatter]
[cheers and applause]
All right. Everybody, letâ€™s welcome to the stage our friend Marc Maron!
[cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for coming. I donâ€™t know if you know this, but youâ€™re in the basement showroom of the historic Village Gate, which was a big venue upstairs and down here that I used to do comedy in when I was a child. Why am I bringing this up? Because some part of me wants to glean some meaning out of that, that I was upstairsâ€“ they used to have a show. I know what I could do. There was a Bill Hicks story. I didnâ€™t prepare. Did you want me to prepare? Upstairs, back in the late â€™80s, they had a showâ€“ the Village Gate, they used to all the old jazz shows, and it was, like, a historic place. But by the late â€™80s, early â€™90s, it was kind of decrepit but cool. And they had a showroom up there, seated about 400 people. And on weekends theyâ€™d do a comedy show there, and the structure of the show was, they had a host, and then they had two comics doing 15 minutes apiece, and an improv group.
Now, this is a story about Bill Hicks. So there was a briefly a time where Bill Hicks lived in New York City. He wasnâ€™t received well, â€™cause New Yorkers donâ€™t understand anger. Like, they understand it, but they donâ€™t understand why itâ€™s onstage. It was so amazing to watch Bill perform in New York, â€™cause literally the audience would be like, â€œWhatâ€™s he so mad about?â€ You know, â€œHe seems angry about something. Isnâ€™t life hard enough?â€
But, like, I remember the night because the comics were me and Hicks, and it didnâ€™t matter, it was interchangeable, but he had already done a few Lettermans, and he was Hicks, so even if he did badly, there was going to need to be some reconstruction, audience-wise, you know?
So I remember, I walked up to him. I went, â€œHey, Bill, you know, â€œyou got the Lettermans and stuff. â€œIâ€™m just starting out. You know, could I go first?â€ â€˜Cause he was supposed to go first. And he was like, â€œNo, man. I got to meet a guy to play chess.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t even know what that means, but it seems important.â€ So Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right, well, I guess Iâ€™ll just follow you, then.â€
And then I remember going to the bathroom, this was upstairs, so I go to the bathroom, and Hicks wasâ€“he went onstage, I go to the bathroom. I donâ€™t know what happened while I was in the bathroom, but when I got out of the bathroom, there was 400 people in this room, and nobodyâ€™s laughing, no oneâ€™s saying anything. There is a silence in the room of 400 that has a suction to it. Itâ€™s like, â€œOh, my God. â€œThereâ€™s actually sound being sucked out of the room by an audience that is in shock,â€ because Bill Hicks is at the lip of the stage, screaming at a woman, like, right where you are. And heâ€™s going, â€œIâ€™m a fucking poet! Iâ€™m a fucking poet!â€ And he stands up, and thereâ€™s nothing but silence. And Iâ€™m standing there like, â€œWhat is happening?â€ And then in the sweetest voice, this woman goes, â€œTell us a poem, then.â€
So whatâ€™s happening? What do you want to talk about? You want to do the act orâ€“ I donâ€™t know. Letâ€™s not. Letâ€™s just work through some stuff. I had a weird thing happen. Like, there is something to be said about doing a lot of drugs at some point in your life. I personally donâ€™t have a lot of respect for people that donâ€™t have the courage to lose complete control of their life for a few years. You know, right down the fucking hole. You know, like, â€œWhat happened?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know. â€œI know itâ€™s time Iâ€™m not getting back. â€œIâ€™d like to think I did some good writing, â€œbut thereâ€™s no real evidence of it. â€œJust random pieces of paper â€œand something I have finished, but I was in it, you know?â€
But, no, there is something to be learned from drug experiences, especially if you go out there, right, bro? Yeah. Soâ€¦ What the point is, I went and ate this Chinese food the other night, and it seems disconnected, but I went to this Chinese restaurant in San Francisco, and there was, likeâ€“ Iâ€™m not a big Chinese food guy, but this was like this, you know, kind of nouveau cool Chinese place, and I ate pastrami kung pao. Thatâ€™s crazy, right? Just chunks of fatty meat with, you know, salt and more salted things. And then there was theâ€“ I think it was just called lamb fat curry, which was just lamb fat and curry and some other vegetables. And then there was these tiki pork bellies. Iâ€™m not sure when it became okay to eat that shit, â€™cause, I mean, itâ€™s not even bacon. Didnâ€™t they used throw that part away, pork belly? But now itâ€™s like, â€œThis is great.â€ So there were these two pieces of pork belly that were justâ€“ I donâ€™t even know if they were deep-fried or what. There were chopsticks, and they were squares, and there was no way to eat them, other then to pick them up and just bite them, and they were just sort of warm gelled fat with crispy outsides.
The point Iâ€™m making is, I ate all this shit, and I got in the car with my friend Jack, and Iâ€™m sitting there, and my hand went numb. Like, literally 20 minutes after I ate that, Iâ€™m like, â€œMy handâ€™s tingling. I canâ€™t feel it.â€ But because of my drug experience, Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m just gonna ride it out.â€ You know what I mean? Itâ€™s probably gonna go away. If it doesnâ€™t, like, maybe my whole right side will go numb, you know? [slurring] And have to talk like this. But right now weâ€™ll see what happens. I wouldnâ€™t have had that wisdom without years of laying in bed on coke, going, â€œPlease not now. Not now. Just ride this out.â€
I am still alive. Thatâ€™s amazing. Itâ€™s all amazing. Iâ€™m happy to say that Iâ€™m having a reasonable midlife crisis. You know, I bought aâ€“ I buy records, and I bought a tube amp. Iâ€™m not gonna drive it into a wall. You know, Iâ€™m not gonna get in trouble for fucking it. But it was weird. Like, what sort of inspired it is, I had these records, and there werenâ€™t even that many records. There was about 300 records that I had, and I had â€™em since high school. I donâ€™t know, I mean, Iâ€™m 49, so, like, when you go through the records that youâ€“ you stop buying them at some point, right around when CDs came out. I donâ€™t even know when that was. In the late â€™80s maybe? But you can go through your whole life with these records that you have. Like, I could see, like, okay, I was trying to, you know, relate to the townies I grew up with. Hereâ€™s some Skynyrd, some Bad Company. Had to do that. And then at some point, you know, like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s where I met the guy in college.â€ All right, soâ€¦ then all of a sudden youâ€™re like, â€œThereâ€™s a lot of Bowie and some Eno and some Fripp. â€œAnd then thereâ€™s, likeâ€“ oh, thereâ€™s college. Thereâ€™s OMD andâ€â€“ I was a little confused, andâ€¦ I go through a little gray area there with who you were, and then you sort of move into jazz and other stuff.
But I got this tube amp. The story of the tube amp is essentiallyâ€“ you know, a tube amp is what you play records through if you want it to be pure, you know, pure tube sound. Just like, from the record to the speaker, no fucking with it. So I interviewed Jack White. Iâ€™m not dropping names. It happened. So I interview Jack White, and I go down to his place, right? And in his studio office, heâ€™s got a wall of McIntosh tube amps, all right? These are the bestâ€“ American-made, beautiful, right? And Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with them, and Iâ€™m like, â€œHeâ€™s got, like, 15 of them,â€ so in my mind Iâ€™m like, â€œIf heâ€™s got 15, I could afford one, right?â€
So I get back to L.A., and I immediately go price McIntosh amps. I go into one place, and Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s the one I want. I said, â€œJack White has those, man. How much is that one?â€ The guy goes, â€œ$14,000.â€ And, look, I could have put it on my credit card, but the truth of the matter is, if you donâ€™t have $14,000 to comfortably throw away on a fucking tube amp, thereâ€™s no way youâ€™re gonna enjoy music through that thing. If I would have bought that thing, every record I put on, Iâ€™d be sitting there going, â€œUh, this doesnâ€™t sound like $14,000. â€œMaybe I move this knob. No, it still doesnâ€™t sound like $14,000.â€
And then eventually youâ€™d go over to some other guyâ€™s house, and he just had a cheap setup and youâ€™d listen to the same record and itâ€™d sound perfect, and you just sit there going, â€œIâ€™m a fucking idiot.â€
So I found a more reasonably priced tube amp, and then I decided, now that Iâ€™m back into recordsâ€“ this has been hanging over me since high school. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ve got to understand Beefheart.â€ Now, like, okay, some of you are gonna get this shit. Otherâ€“I donâ€™t knowâ€“ you know. Captain Beefheart has been hanging over me, like this weird, you know, crypticâ€“ you know, I canâ€™t evenâ€“ Iâ€™m not evenâ€“ I will never be smart enough or large enough of mind to assess and understand Captain Beefheart. Like, itâ€™s just been hanging there, but as soon as I start getting into records, I was like, â€œI got to fucking understand Beefheart.â€
And the day came where I bought my stuff andâ€“ okay, it was a Sunday morning. My girlfriend was hungover. I remember this well, because, like, thereâ€™s a couple things I could do when my girlfriendâ€™s hungoverâ€“ generally would be to reprimand her and wake up and go, â€œYou donâ€™t feel good, right? â€œWell, maybe you shouldnâ€™t have drank â€œand made a fool out of yourself and me. â€œWouldnâ€™t that have been a good thing if you didnâ€™t fucking do that?â€ And, you know, just keep pushing until she cried. Because I donâ€™t really know if someone loves me if I canâ€™t make them cry. Soâ€¦ Isnâ€™t that the test for all of us, really? If youâ€™re with somebody and you donâ€™t know if you can make them cry, Iâ€™d really go deeper. Wouldnâ€™t trust that bond.
But I made a different choice that morning. I went with, â€œHey, baby. You feel shitty? Look, you want me to go get you a breakfast burrito?â€ So that was how I treated it, but I knew that the record store was right next to the breakfast burrito place. All right? So I go to Atwater Village, and I go to the burrito place, and I go upâ€“thereâ€™s a Latino guy there, which I expected. Iâ€™m not racist, but I was like, â€œOh, yeah, of course youâ€™re here.â€ So I ordered the burrito from him, and then I go three doors down to the record store, and I must haveâ€“I was almost in, like, a panic. You know, I just walk into this record store, and it was only open for, like, ten minutes. I just barge in. Iâ€™m like, â€œBeefheart! Whereâ€™s the Beefheart?â€ And the the guy in there, it was almost as if he was expecting me. Heâ€™s like, â€œYep.â€ And, likeâ€¦ And he walks me over to this bin, and Iâ€™m like, â€œWhich one? Which one?â€ â€œSafe as Milk.â€ â€œAll right, this is the one? All right, good.â€ And as Iâ€™m walking out, I see thereâ€™s a sealed Kraftwerk album, and Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, Iâ€™m still kind of gay.â€ So, like, I get that. So I got Kraftwerk, and I got Beefheart, and I purchase it, and I go back to the burrito place. I timed it right to pick up her burrito. You know, and then Iâ€™m waiting on the line. I got my records, and thereâ€™s some big old weird-looking dude behind me, and I approached the Latino kid, and he says, â€œWhatâ€™d you get?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYou wouldnâ€™t understand.â€ Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing in my mind. So I go, â€œI got Captain Beefheart.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOh, really? Which one?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œSafe as Milk.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s a good start.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWho the fuck are you?â€ You know? And then it just became this pocket of weirdness, because I was like, â€œAll right, so heâ€™s on to it.â€ You know? And then, like, Iâ€™m walkingâ€“ I turn around and go walk out and the guy behind me is this largeâ€“kind of looks likeâ€“ you know, he looks like the dudeâ€“ he lived through the â€™60s and, you know, survived it. He had heard the exchange with the Latino guy, and then as Iâ€™m walking out, I hear him right here to the side of my head go, â€œTrying to catch up, huh?â€ But it was likeâ€“to me, it didnâ€™t even come off as an insult. Like, I walked right by him, and Iâ€™m like, â€œThat is all Iâ€™m doing.â€ I mean, I think in every aspect of my life, that is all Iâ€™m doing. So then I felt like, â€œThat was the Buddha. That guy was the Buddha,â€ and I so wanted to go back and have him not be there and then ask the Latino guy, â€œWhereâ€™s that guy that was behind me?â€ And have the Latino guy go, â€œThere was no one behind you.â€
Yeah, so thatâ€™sâ€“yeah, so Iâ€™m doing the vinyl thing. Vinyl midlife crisis. I didnâ€™t anticipate doing that story at all. â€œWhy are you sitting weird?â€ I donâ€™t know. Honestly, though, like, I didnâ€™t prepare that well, â€™cause thatâ€™s just the way I do it. I donâ€™tâ€“like, I donâ€™t believe in preparing. I personally donâ€™t really like preparers. Theyâ€™re annoying people, generally. Like, you know, itâ€™s like, â€œI really prepared for this.â€ Well, youâ€™re a coward. You know? Whereâ€™s your sense of adventure? How important is it that youâ€“ like, you know, why set yourself up for that? You know what I mean? Everyone with this careerist culture, you know? This sort of, like, trajectory thing. You know, itâ€™s gonna kill you. Youâ€™re gonna end up lonely at the end and not doing what you want to do. Donâ€™t prepare, man. Just load up. [laughter]
I think thatâ€™s the key. I think Iâ€™m rationalizing, though. Clearly Iâ€™m rationalizing, because thatâ€™s my system. I mean, this is my system. Itâ€™s right there on the floor. Why did I bring notebooks out here? What, am I gonna look at notebooks? Is that why I brought them out here? Itâ€™s ridiculous. Iâ€™m more professional. Iâ€™ve been doing this half my fucking life. Iâ€™m gonna bring notebooks out? Itâ€™s to prove a point. Itâ€™s to prove a point. Iâ€™ll show you in a minute. I justâ€“Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t prepare becauseâ€“ look, itâ€™s my system. Howâ€™s that? In my mind, if I donâ€™t prepare and I pull this off, Iâ€™m a fucking genius. Iâ€™m a genius. Right? And if I donâ€™t pull it off, I didnâ€™t prepare. If I would have set my mind to it, I would have nailed that shit, but, no, I didnâ€™t prepare, because I like to roll the dice, man. Feel alive! Whatâ€™s gonna happen? I donâ€™t know. I might fail. All right. Fuck them. That would be you. Iâ€™m not gonna blame myself for that.
Soâ€“yeah, the reason I brought this out here, â€™cause I know a lot of you are creative people, and I just wanted to share my system of success. I choose to write on hotel stationary. This is how I write. This is the process. Can you read that? I canâ€™t read that. Thatâ€™s also part of my process, is be sure to impulsively write quickly with a borrowed writing instrument in a cursive that is unreadable, because this is just phase one of the process. The second phase is decoding, understanding the text. Sure, write smaller and underline occasionally. Thatâ€™s good too. Or perhaps you can get to a point where, hey, letâ€™s get to the final part where you type it up, right? Right there, thatâ€™s an almost finished joke, and over here, written is a punch line. I canâ€™t read it. See? Make it challenging at all levels.
This is a system thatâ€™s kept me out of the big time for 25 years, right here. The reason Iâ€™m illustrating it to you is thatâ€¦ my system sort of looks like this. When I write, I donâ€™t write jokes, I write thoughts, and I think the action of actually doing the writing is whatâ€™s important to me. Itâ€™s not whether or not I remember it or anything. So my writing process is, I could be in a coffee shop, I could be standing on a bank line with their deposit slips, maybe waiting at a cash register. So my process looks something like this. â€œOh, shit. Fuck. â€œYou got a pen? Do you have a pen? â€œJust hand me that. â€œCan Iâ€“hand me that piece of paper. â€œThankâ€“pen? Okay. â€œUh, okay, I got it. Thanks, man. Saved a life today.â€ You know, â€œAll right.â€ So then I have the paper. So thatâ€™s really done. Thatâ€™s the entire creative experience for me. Itâ€™s done, because a lot of them donâ€™t ever go anywhere. So that piece of paper goes onto a stack of pieces of paper that look a lot like itâ€“ napkins and stuff.
Now, the problem is, if I get too far away from those things, I donâ€™t know what I was thinking, so if I ever get to themâ€“ like, I found a napkin not long ago, had three words on it, â€œauto erotic asphyxiation.â€ That was what was on the napkin. So thatâ€™s sort of a problem, right? â€˜Cause now I got to sit there with that thing and go, â€œWhat was going on that day?â€ Like, I would have remembered if I did that. I mean, thatâ€“ â€™cause thatâ€™s a big day. Thatâ€™s kind of a game-changer. I mean, you donâ€™t do that and go, â€œOh, fuck, yeah, I remember. I did that.â€ No, if you do that once, you do that. Youâ€™ve done that. And, then, like, Iâ€™m looking at it, and I remember, â€œOh, I was in a hotel room.â€ I decided at some point that autoerotic asphyxiation is strictly a hotel room activity. Thatâ€“like, no one is doing that at home. You know, I picture men leaving on business trips, saying, â€œHoney, whereâ€™s that belt I always bring? â€œYou know, the one with the weird markings? I know Iâ€™m not that skinny. I donâ€™t know how that happened.â€ All right. But then I decided that autoerotic asphyxiation was discovered or invented in a hotel room. This was my logic. I spent a lot of time in hotels. I travel alone for my job. Iâ€™m under the impression that if you go out on the road, whether itâ€™s for business or pleasure, and you stay at a hotel alone for at least a night, at some point during your stay, you will find yourself in that hotel room alone, thinking this: â€œI want to fucking kill myself.â€ Itâ€™s gonna happen. Itâ€™s a hotel room. But if youâ€™re me, like, three minutes later youâ€™ll say, â€œNo, Iâ€™ll just jerk off.â€ So how long before one day youâ€™re like, â€œHey, maybe we can bring these two things together. â€œMaybe we can take this masturbation thing â€œto the next level. â€œI want this to be life-threatening. â€œI want to push the envelope. Iâ€™m not really a sports guy, but extreme wanking I could handle.â€
Now, look, I know a lot of you clammed up on that, but this is just the way my brain works. I have not done it, so donâ€™t judge me in that way. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s outside of the realm of possibility. I may do it, and I know exactly how it would go down. I know exactly how it would happen. It would beâ€“ probably be after a show. Maybe this one. I would get back to my hotel room, and Iâ€™d be all jacked up from the show, and Iâ€™d be like, â€œFuck. What am I gonna do now? â€œFuck, Iâ€™m gonna do it. Fuck it. â€œIâ€™m gonna do it. â€œAll right, I know I need a belt. â€œOkay? â€œI had a good set. I earned this. â€œI think, what, you got to hang from a door. â€œThatâ€™s how those guys end up in the paper. â€œWaitâ€“should I pull my pants down now or wait? â€œOh, fuck. Google it. Google. â€œAutoerotic asphyxiation: â€œhow. â€œHoly shitâ€“I would have died if I did it that way. â€œI would have fucking died. â€œOh, fuck. I lived. Iâ€™m just gonna do it regular. That was crazy.â€
I spend a lot of time in hotels. I do. Itâ€™s just part of the job. Itâ€™s just part of my life. And I donâ€™t mind it. I got nothing to complain about. I mean, I got to wake up early sometimes to enter a morning zoo format. I have to get up to do morning zoo radio. [grumbles] As many of you know, in every great city or lesser city in this country thereâ€™s a morning zoo situation happening, and comics sometimes have to enter that situation and play along to sell tickets. Now, as many of you know, a morning zoo format, traditionally there is a main guy, a laughing guy, and a baffled and shocked woman. Thatâ€™s the classic setup, give or take the woman or the laughing guy. If I were to do an impression of that, there was just sounds, it would be, â€œBah. Bah-bah-bah. Bah-bah-bah.â€ [laughing hysterically] â€œOh, fellas.â€ So I have to deal with that.
Now, in this particular story, Iâ€™m in Cleveland at a hotel. I get up at 5:30, which quite honestly, is bullshit for anybody. 5:30 is bullshit. I mean, is it night? Is it fucking day? What the fuck is 5:30? I donâ€™t care who you are, whether you have to wake up for it or youâ€™ve been up all night for 5:30, itâ€™s bullshit. Of course if youâ€™ve been up all night for 5:30, you have other problems. Usually if you see the sun come up at 5:30, youâ€™re saying something like, â€œFuck, should we call the guy?â€ You know? â€œNo, dude, we ran out at the right time.â€ â€œFuck you, I need a bump for work.â€ â€œNo, fuck you. You got a drug problem.â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna tell me I have a fucking drug problem in my apartment, asshole?â€ â€œYeah, you do. We donâ€™t need more blow.â€ â€œFuck you! â€œI just listened to you talk about your guitar â€œfor four hours, â€œand youâ€™re gonna tell me â€œthat I canâ€™t have another fucking bump? Get the fuck out of my apartment.â€ Sorry. Flashback. So I wake up at 5:30 to do morning radio, and I realize I had forgotten my toothbrush, so then thereâ€™s this dialogue that happens in my head. Like, one part of me is like, â€œYou fucking idiot. â€œYouâ€™re a professional traveler. How could you forget your toothbrush, stupid?â€ And then the other part of me is like, â€œHey, take it easy on us. You know, it happens.â€ And then the other guy is like, â€œFuck you. Take it easy? Itâ€™s your fault, asshole.â€ And then a voice I donâ€™t know goes, â€œOh, fellas.â€ And then I realize, â€œHoly shit, â€œI can just call the front desk of the hotel â€œand you can ask them for a toothbrush,â€ and they will give you, like, half a toothbrush. Like, not even a real toothbrush. Like, thisâ€“you get it, and youâ€™re like, â€œWhy do they even bother making these?â€ So I call the front desk, and no one answers the phone. Thatâ€™s a lonely feeling. Right? Why isnâ€™t someone answering? Thereâ€™s always supposed to be someone at the front desk at the hotel. Why arenâ€™t they answering? Thatâ€™s weird. What was weirder was my first thought when no one answered, my first real thought was, â€œOh, fuck. Zombies.â€ And it wasnâ€™t even a fake thought. It was a real fear in that moment. I donâ€™t know what that says about us as a culture, that my first real fear was, â€œOh, fuck. Zombies.â€ But I know it was genuine, because there were thoughts that followed. The thought that followed that was, â€œHow many more are left like me? Should I be stockpiling food? Do I need a weapon?â€ These were practical questions. And then I remember, like, getting exasperated and taking a deep breath and thinking, â€œIâ€™m not prepared to lead.â€ Like, I really hope thereâ€™s an alpha male out there with a rudimentary sense of tribalism that can lead me and a frightened multiethnic crew of people through this postapocalyptic zombie landscape, or Iâ€™m fucking food. I mean, Iâ€™m food in 20 minutes if that guyâ€™s not fucking out there, you know? And then the woman picks up. â€œSorry to keep you waiting. Can I help you?â€ And I go, â€œWhat is going on down there?â€ And she said, â€œExcuse me?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy didnâ€™t you answer? Weâ€™re in trouble!â€ And she said, â€œWhatâ€™s the matter, sir? Can I help you?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI need a fucking toothbrush.â€ And she said, â€œThereâ€™s no reason for that language. Iâ€™ll send one up.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo zombies!â€ And then, like, I realize I just said that out loud to a person and that maybe I should clear something up. So I caught myself, and I thought this would take care of it. Iâ€™m like, â€œHey, Iâ€™m sorry. I got to do radio.â€ Like that should make it understandable to someone who has no idea who I am or my life. So Iâ€™m sure she hung up and said, â€œThereâ€™s someone on meth upstairs. â€œBut that doesnâ€™t really add up because he asked for a toothbrush.â€ Yeah, soâ€“yeah, so thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s the life. Yeah. You guys are good. Youâ€™re a good audience. I attract a lot of sweet-looking people. I donâ€™t know how thatâ€¦ But you knowâ€¦ When I was upstairs opening for Hicks, you guys wouldnâ€™t have liked me at all. Itâ€™s a different style of comedy. I donâ€™t know. I sort of evolved. Or devolved. Iâ€™m not sure what. Letâ€™s see, what would Marc have been like? The guy that was upstairs. Here, Iâ€™ll try to capture the essence. [grunts] [groans] Uh-huh. Then somehow that just becameâ€¦ [sighs] Hey. No, but I judged you. But I judge in general. I think we all do. Like, I sat over there, and I looked at the audience. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, they look good.â€ You know, I judge. I judge everything. I judge all the time. Iâ€™m a great judger. I have shitty judgment, but Iâ€™m a great judger. Iâ€™ll judge the fuck out of almost everything. I fucking love it. Iâ€™ll own it. I hate when people say, â€œHey, donâ€™t judge.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck you. Donâ€™t take away my hobbies.â€ I mean, if there is a god, why should he have all the fun? I love to fucking judge. What does that even mean, â€œDonâ€™t judgeâ€? What does the resting human brain do other than go, â€œWhat the fuck is that guy?â€ I mean, what are you gonna do? I mean, thereâ€™s reallyâ€“ thereâ€™s eating. Thereâ€™s, â€œOh, Iâ€™m working now.â€ And, like, â€œThat guyâ€™s an idiot.â€ Thatâ€™s all there is. And then fucking, but youâ€™re usually judging at least for a few minutes during that, till you lose yourself and then you think youâ€™re a hero of some kind. Butâ€¦ I donâ€™t even know what that meant, but I think it makes sense. But the point is, I learned a lesson about judgment. Thereâ€™s a story that I want to tell, because I think itâ€™s an important story to tell. Iâ€™m at a hotel in Montreal. All thatâ€™s happening in this story is, Iâ€™m walking towards an elevator. Thatâ€™s it. I am walking towards an elevator. Thereâ€™s a guy in front of me about 20 feet walking towards the elevator. Heâ€™s wearing shorts. Thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s happening. Now, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on with me that day. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s something on my mind, but I do know that when I looked up and noticed that guy, my brain went, â€œFuck those shorts.â€ But that angry. I mean, immediately. Like, â€œWho the fuck? What kind of fucking idiotâ€“â€ Like, I was that hostile. Now, weâ€™ve all had that happen. You see somebody you donâ€™t know dressed a certain way, and youâ€™re just walking down the street and youâ€™re like, â€œOh, fuck you. â€œNow your weird attempt at self is cluttering my fucking brain? â€œLike, what are you trying to present me here? â€œWhat era are you going for? Where are we? â€œI mean, is that a real beard? Is that a coffee shop beard? â€œIs that a â€˜the Jews run the government, â€œI shit in an outhouseâ€™ beard? â€œWhat are you trying to do? â€œDo you need those glasses, or are you just a glasses delivery system?â€ Anyways, you get what Iâ€™m saying. And Iâ€™ve made bad choices in that area. Iâ€™ve been on the other side of that. There is footage of me on Conan Oâ€™Brien, 1992, sitting confidently beside him, wearing black leather pants and a black velvet Nehru jacket. That exists in the world. I left my house thinking that was a good idea, that I could transcend that outfit in a non-ironic way and be funny. What the fuck was I thinking? I mean, did I leave my house thinking, like, â€œIâ€™m Bono. You know, I can do this.â€ All right, back to the elevator. So by the time I get to the elevator, Iâ€™m seething with anger at that guyâ€™s pants choice. Literally, like, â€œYouâ€™re a fucking idiot. â€œPeople wouldnâ€™t even wear those shorts on vacation. Youâ€™re so fuckingâ€“ How the fuckâ€“â€ Like, I was so furious. I was seething, right? And I hadnâ€™t even seen him from the front yet. We get on the elevator, he turns around, and heâ€™s got a scar that starts on the center of his forehead and goes all the way around his skull. My only thought in that moment was, â€œOh, you can wear â€™em.â€ But I donâ€™t evenâ€“ what does that even mean? Like, what went through my mind? Like, letâ€™s do, like, a montage. All right, first shot, he turns around. My thought, â€œWhat happened to your head, man?â€ Right? Second thought was probably, â€œThat must have been touch-and-go for at least an afternoon.â€ You know, concerned family wandering the hospital hallways, the whole bit. Then the third thought must have been, like, â€œWell, youâ€™ve earned the right to pretty much wear whatever you want, pal.â€ And I guess the final thought was, â€œOh, Iâ€™m gonna give you a pass today, â€œâ€™cause Iâ€™m the king of this elevator, â€œand youâ€™re my guest. What floor would you like?â€ Yeah, I donâ€™t believe in God, and I donâ€™tâ€¦ Itâ€™s not becauseâ€“ Iâ€™m not an atheist. I donâ€™t call myself an atheist. I just donâ€™t give a shit, really. Is that okay? I mean, I think itâ€™s a pretty enviable position to be in, because it pisses people off more than atheists. â€˜Cause, like, if someone goes, â€œDo you believe in God?â€ and youâ€™re like, â€œI donâ€™t give a fuck,â€ theyâ€™re like, â€œWell, what does that even mean? Pick a side! What the fuck?â€ Atheists are annoying. Theyâ€™re annoying. And I think they just like toâ€“ theyâ€™re control freaks who like to argue. They like to win. You know, theyâ€™re buzzkill poetry assassins. I donâ€™t understand, you know, what it is theyâ€™re after, exactly. And now they think theyâ€™re the minority voice. You know, theyâ€™re like, â€œCome on, weâ€™re the minority voice. â€œWe have to have our point of view too, and why isnâ€™t our voice out there?â€ Because itâ€™s shrill and annoying, and no one really wants to hear it, butâ€¦ Thatâ€™s really the only reason. We understand your point. Itâ€™s just when you talk about it, we just hate you. And I certainly wouldnâ€™t want to have lunch with an atheist, â€™cause I know where that goes within ten minutes. Iâ€™d be just screaming, like, â€œAll right! â€œYouâ€™re right! Shut up! You win! What do you need?â€ And youâ€™re not even talking about God. Youâ€™re just talking about lunch or anything. Theyâ€™re just annoying. Now, my bigger question about atheists is that, has there ever been a moment where theyâ€™ve actually talked a believer out of their god? And what does that moment look like? If that is their agenda, what does that moment look like, given the atheists that perhaps you know? Seriously. All right, Iâ€™ve created an analogy. I picture it going like this. Thereâ€™s some dude just walking down the street, and things have been hard for him, and heâ€™s probably thinking like, â€œYou know, things arenâ€™t going well, â€œbut, you know, I got God in my heart, â€œand that makes me feel better. â€œYou know, he gives me hope that things are gonna be okay. Godâ€™s looking out for me.â€ And then out of the bushes jumps an atheist. [screams] â€œThereâ€™s no god! Youâ€™re living a lie! â€œThereâ€™s no proof! You believe in a cartoon! Itâ€™s a delusion, stupid!â€ And then the guys just goes, â€œOh, I never thought about it like that. â€œOh, no. I think youâ€™re right. â€œI think youâ€™re right. Thereâ€™s no God. Everythingâ€™s just bad. Itâ€™s just bad.â€ What does an atheist do at that moment? â€œBoom! Who wins? â€œYeah! â€œOh, I won! Iâ€™m gonna go tell my shitty friends.â€ My point is, there are no atheist soup kitchens. [scattered applause] So just shut up. And if there wereâ€“ if there were an atheist soup kitchen, no homeless people would go there. Theyâ€™d be like, â€œNo, theyâ€™re depressing and annoying. â€œThe foodâ€™s better, but it ainâ€™t worth it, man. â€œLetâ€™s just go over to where the sisters are and fucking have a warm meal.â€ Vegans too. Like, look, I get it. I understand you have an ideological eating disorder. But I donâ€™t want to have lunch with you either, â€™cause I know how that goes. 15 minutes in that lunch, Iâ€™m gonna be like, â€œAll right, Iâ€™m not gonna eat it. â€œAre you happy? â€œWe didnâ€™t save a pig. We wasted one. â€œI know theyâ€™re smart. I get it. â€œOkay, look. You know what? â€œWhy donâ€™t you go to where the smart pigs are â€œand lead a smart pig revolution? â€œIf you showed up and just converged on a town â€œwith a bunch of smart pigs, â€œif you could find talking pigs, â€œall the more awesome, all right? â€œIf you did that, I would never eat meat again, and I think it would be hilarious.â€ An atheist vegan, that would be horrendous. Right? I would rather spend an hour with a reasonable Christian on a mission than spend, like, any time at all with an atheist vegan. â€˜Cause I know what Iâ€™m getting into with a reasonable Christian on a mission, right? I know that one. All right, letâ€™s picture it. Iâ€™ll do my side of that conversation. Iâ€™m approached by a reasonable Christian on a mission on the street. Letâ€™s go there now. â€œOh, hi. â€œWow, yes, I am lost. â€œIt is sad. â€œOkay, wait. Stop right there. I got a question. â€œWhat if I let him into my heart and then I want him out? â€œIs there any way to get Jesus out of your heart â€œonce heâ€™s in there? â€œLike, do people ever experience chest pains? Theyâ€™re like, â€˜Jesus wants out. He wants out.'â€ Look, I got nothing against Jesus. Like, if you want to hang your hopes on a flying Jew, thatâ€™s fine. Iâ€™m not here to take God away from anybody. Iâ€™m not here to mock the myths that define you. The bottom line is, the only reason Iâ€™m like this is, I wasnâ€™t brought up with God, so I donâ€™t have one. The only way you get God is if youâ€™re brought up by parents that pounded it into your head, â€™cause theyâ€™re frightened and think itâ€™s the right way to do things, â€™cause they donâ€™t know how to control you and theyâ€™re nervous and they think that will help somehow. So either you get it when youâ€™re a kid or your life goes so far off the rails that youâ€™re left with no choice but to reach out to something bigger than you to fucking keep your sanity. Those are the only two ways you can get God. Either youâ€™re brought up with it, or you either metaphorically or literally find yourself in a puddle of your own pee, you know, perhaps bleeding from someplace, itâ€™s not even clear at that moment, and youâ€™re just sitting there saying something like, â€œWhereâ€™s my shoe? Whereâ€™s my shoe? Iâ€™m in trouble.â€ And then, like Jiminy Cricket, Jesus shows up. [whistles] And you go, â€œJesus, youâ€™re here.â€ And Jesus goes, â€œYes, my son, and I have your shoe.â€ So thereâ€™s that moment, the born-again moment. And most people go with Jesus at that moment, when theyâ€™re broken like that. But I found that thatâ€™s also a crossroads. If youâ€™re not gonna go for Jesus, youâ€™re not gonna go for Jesus, but I find that thereâ€™s this weird line where, like, your life goes off the rails, and either youâ€™re gonna go with Jesus or, from my experience, youâ€™re gonna go become a massage therapist. These seem to be the two avenues for broken, lost people. Theyâ€™re gonna go with Jesus, or theyâ€™re gonna be like, â€œI just want to touch people in a healing way.â€ And yoga instructor. Whatever youâ€™re gonna do. Spiritual. Thereâ€™s another problem. Okay, so youâ€™re spiritual. Do you have a god? â€œNo. I have a mat.â€ Look, I donâ€™t want to talk about religion forever. You know, I was born a Jew, and I remain a Jew, culturally. But Iâ€™m not a Jewy Jew. You know, I donâ€™tâ€“you know. And quite frankly I have a problem with the Hasidim. I resent them. They make me uncomfortable, and I think theyâ€™re freakish, and they bother me. And I donâ€™t know why I can feel comfortable saying that. You know, why do I think itâ€™s okay for me to say shitty things about the Hasidim? â€˜Cause what are they gonna do? They gonna, you know, write me an email? Are they going to engage me online? [with Jewish accent] â€œI really donâ€™t understand â€œwhy you would say that about your own kind. Are you not a Jew?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, but you guys are freaks and you dress funny.â€ â€œBut thatâ€™s just the way we believe.â€ â€œLike, how are you even writing in this accent?â€ Umâ€¦ I think they just annoy me, because, like, itâ€™s got to be something Iâ€™m jealous of. Thereâ€™s got to be something that bothers me about them, you know, as a Jew. I think itâ€™s because, literally, like, some part of my brain thinks, â€œWell, theyâ€™ve got ritual, theyâ€™ve got discipline, â€œtheyâ€™ve got community, theyâ€™ve got beliefs. Theyâ€™ve got all that stuff.â€ They never wake up in the morning and say, â€œWhat am I gonna wear today?â€ You know? â€œHow about the leather pants and the black Nehru jacket? What would the Rebbe think about that?â€ [chuckles] But I do think theyâ€™re freaks. I will drive through Hasidic areas as if theyâ€™re wildlife parks, with, like, the same energy. Like, â€œOoh, theyâ€™re out. Theyâ€™re out. â€œIt must be feeding time or the Sabbath. â€œOh, speed up. Theyâ€™re coming towards the car. Oh, my Godâ€“theyâ€™re doing the Fiddler dance.â€ [imitates If I Were a Rich Man] Thatâ€™s wrong, as a Jew, to do that, to talk about other Jews like that. I donâ€™t know. I grew up in the middle class, you know, just conservative American Jew guy. You know, youâ€™re not that invested in it. You get your Bar Mitzvah, do the thing. Go to the stupid temple, where they have the dumb gift shop, the shitty watercolors of Hasidim at the Wall. You make fun of â€™em when youâ€™re a kid. Like, â€œThose are bad.â€ And the ladyâ€™s like, â€œThose were done by a member of our congregation.â€ â€œYeah, but they still suck.â€ â€œYeah, well, heâ€™s a survivor.â€ â€œOh, why doesnâ€™t he paint that? â€œYou donâ€™t think watercolor can handle the camps? Why condescend an already under-appreciated medium?â€ But the weird thing about being just an American Jew is that thereâ€™s thisâ€“ underneath all of it, even if youâ€™re not religious, which I never wasâ€“ I was just culturally Jewishâ€“ thereâ€™s this drumbeat beneath all America Judaism. Like, â€œYou will go to Israel, â€œand you will love Israel. â€œIsrael was built for us. â€œYou will go there and love it â€œand send it money and let it do whatever it wants to, â€œwhoever it wants to, even if itâ€™s wrong.â€ And eventually youâ€™ll go to Israel. You wonâ€™t necessarily know why youâ€™re there, but youâ€™ll go there. Like, I went there with my first wife, the Jew. That was a mistake. Iâ€“what? I married a Jew. It was a mistake. I just found that if youâ€™re a Jew and you marry a Jew, that means everything you hated about going home is now in your house. Some people find that comforting. I found it disconcerting and a little uncomfortable for me. Itâ€™s amazing. Like, when you marry a Jew, if youâ€™re a Jew, thatâ€™s the day you become an old Jewish person. You donâ€™t realize it, but itâ€™s encultured into you. Thatâ€™s when the switch goes on. I married her, I was in my 30s. Within two weeks of marrying her, I was just a 30-year-old angry Jewish guy with his own mind and point of view. Within three weeks of marrying a Jew, I talked like this, â€œWhat? â€œWhat do you mean, â€˜Where are we gonna eatâ€™? Weâ€™ll eat where you want to eat.â€ Howâ€™d that happen? Who am I? All right. Letâ€™s get back to Israel real quick, and then weâ€™ll move on to other things. So some point during that marriage we went to Israel, â€™cause we were Jews and we were programmed to go to Israel. Now, when you go to Israel, youâ€™re supposed to get there and be like, â€œIâ€™m home. Finally I understand where my heart is.â€ Thatâ€™s how youâ€™re supposed to feel when you get off the plane is Israel. That was not my experience. I literallyâ€“ the plane door opened, I got on the stairs, and I was like, â€œWe have to get the fuck out of here. â€œWe reallyâ€“ that guyâ€™s got a gun. â€œThereâ€™s chaos. â€œI donâ€™t even know why weâ€™re here. â€œThere seems to be problems that have nothing to do with us. Why is this a vacation?â€ And then other Jews will comfort you and go, â€œNo, no, itâ€™s right. Itâ€™s good.â€ And then youâ€™re like, â€œOkay, letâ€™s go on the rides.â€ And thenâ€¦ So then you spend some time walking by ruins, just piles of rocks that used to be other things, with pictures of what they used to be, and you go, â€œOh, look at that. Yep, it was Jewish.â€ And thenâ€¦ and then you go by some other rocks, and youâ€™re like, â€œWhat is this? Oh, it wasnâ€™t Jewish. Mm.â€ And then eventually youâ€™ll end up at the Wailing Wall. Thatâ€™s the big payoff, man. Thatâ€™s, like, home turf for the Hasidim. Thatâ€™s the big thing there. Thatâ€™s where they all go to cluster. What you donâ€™t realize, though, is thatâ€™s where Hasidic Jews come from, the real ones. Like, I donâ€™t know if you know this, but if you go to the Wailing Wall early enough in the morning, itâ€™s just hats on the ground. And if you look at, like, a time-lapse photograph of the day, you literally likeâ€¦ Thatâ€™s a little secret that a lot of you non-Jews didnâ€™t know about. They come right out of the ground in Israel. Yeah. So, all rightâ€“so letâ€™s move on. Letâ€™s move on to some other things to talk about. Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to mix it up. [laughs] Thereâ€™s things in my mind, man. Oh, Iâ€™m fucking sweating. My stomach was hurting before. I donâ€™t know how that happened. Iâ€™ve been traveling a lot, and I didnâ€™t feel nervous about coming out here, because, like, I trust you people. I think weâ€™re okay. But, like, maybe my stomach wasâ€“I donâ€™t know. Like, Iâ€™ve always been an anxious, nervous, person, and I would have psychosomatic events. Is that the word? Did I ever tell you that story about how I cured being a hypochondriac? Do you know that story? Thatâ€™s a good story. My father was a doctor, which means I was a hypochondriac. How else are you gonna get their attention? Nowâ€¦ Am I gonna tellâ€“ okay, letâ€™s do it. When you grow up with a dad whoâ€™s a doctor, you have access to other doctors, andâ€“well, hereâ€™s the story. I was at college, I was a sophomore in college, and somewhere about a month or so before Christmas break, I decided that I had M.S. So I started calling my father. Like, â€œDad, I have M.S.â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œYou donâ€™t have M.S.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHow do you know? How do you know? â€œYou havenâ€™t examined me. I donâ€™t know how you would know that.â€ He goes, â€œI know you donâ€™t have M.S.â€ He goes, â€œWhat are your symptoms?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know. My hands are tingly.â€ â€œSon, you donâ€™t have M.S. Are you drinking coffee?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI drink coffee.â€ â€œItâ€™s probably coffee.â€ â€œNo, I have M.S.â€ And thenâ€“okay. So he hangs up. And then, like, a couple weeks later, Iâ€™m likeâ€“I call him up. â€œI have M.S. I still have M.S.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou donâ€™t have M.S.â€ And then that ends that conversation. And then, like, a week beforeâ€“ maybe a week before, I call him up and Iâ€™m like, â€œDad, I have prostate cancer. I have prostate cancer.â€ He goes, â€œHow do you know?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know. â€œIt hurts down by my balls and stuff, â€œand I think I have prostate cancer. It kind of hurts on my butt cheeks and stuff.â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œYou donâ€™t have prostate cancer.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI do.â€ And then I called him every day for a week. Justâ€“â€œI have prostate cancer. I have prostate cancer.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re too young for prostate cancer.â€ â€œI know I have it.â€ So I get off the plane when I got home. Itâ€™s, like, 6:00 or 7:00 at night, and my father says, â€œWeâ€™re going to Bob Rosenâ€™s house to get you examined.â€ This a urologist friend of his. So heâ€™s taking me to a manâ€™s house to be examined for prostate cancer. So he picks me up at the airport. Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, weâ€™re going now.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™sâ€“ why canâ€™t I just go to his office?â€ â€œNo, you have prostate cancer. Weâ€™re gonna go now.â€ So we drive to this guyâ€™s house, whoâ€“ he doesnâ€™t know weâ€™re coming. Soâ€¦ We walk up to the door, my father knocks on the door, and Bob literally is likeâ€“ he shows up, heâ€™s got a napkin, heâ€™s wiping his mouth. I see his familyâ€™s at the dinner table. My father goes, â€œMy son thinks he has prostate cancer. Can you take a look?â€ And Bobâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know what you mean.â€ Heâ€™sâ€“â€œWell, come on in.â€ And then he goes back to the table, he puts a napkin down, and then he walks me and my father into his bedroom, and weâ€™re all standing there, and Iâ€™m like, â€œThis in any other situation would be illegal. â€œWhateverâ€™s happening, whateverâ€™s about to happen, this is bad.â€ And thank God Bob says, â€œYou know what, he should probably come to the office. I donâ€™t think this is the place to do this.â€ And my fatherâ€™s like, â€œAre you sure? Is that all right with you, kid?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, itâ€™s probably better.â€ All right, so, Bob didnâ€™t finger-bang me in his bedroom. With my father watching, nonetheless. So this is how I cured my hypochondriac-ness. Hypochondria. All right, so I go to Bobâ€™s office. Does the horrible examination. Itâ€™s very difficult. You know, when youâ€™re a man, this isâ€“ I know women have their thing, but Iâ€™m not a woman. I know that as a dude, I got to go in and get finger-banged by a guy, you know, once a year, in a clinical way, but itâ€™s always awkward. Itâ€™s never a pleasant situation. The most awkward part about is, like, you get to a certain age where itâ€™s about to happen, and it goes in and youâ€™re like, â€œOh, I kind of get this. Wait, Iâ€™m not changing my life.â€ Soâ€¦ Butâ€¦ It does seem to do something. But, okay, so he gives me the examination, and then he, you know, he dives in. Itâ€™s really hard. I donâ€™t want to go into it. But he does the examination. It turns out I had something. I had something. Huh? Yay. I had some sort of prostatitis, which my dad gets too. Itâ€™s some sort ofâ€“you know, sensitive to it or what. So I had something. Great. I was right. Now, what happens next is, a week later, itâ€™s supposed to be gone, but I still feel it, right? So I go into Bobâ€™s office, and I go, â€œI think I still have it.â€ He goes, â€œNo, youâ€™ve been on antibiotics for 12 days. Itâ€™s gone.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, Iâ€™m pretty sure that I have it still.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, you donâ€™t have it.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ He goes, â€œYou want me to examine you again?â€ â€œIf you have to.â€ So he does it again. I do it again. I get finger-banged by Bob Rosen again. Twice. Okay. So now, like, another week goes by, Iâ€™m about to go back to school, and I decide I have herpes on my cock. Now, the irony of this is, I had not had sex. I had somehow gotten it from something. It was a unique case. [laughs] So I, you knowâ€“sadly, I probably just, likeâ€“ I probably just jerked off too hard. That was the sad part about it. Like, all right, anywaysâ€¦ Look, I didnâ€™t want to do this story. All right, soâ€¦ So now I got to go back to Bob Rosen. So this isâ€“like, Iâ€™ve been at this house. Iâ€™ve been finger-banged by him twice. And now a week later Iâ€™m going back with herpes that isnâ€™t even there. So I go into Bobâ€™s office and I goâ€“ heâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€ and Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m pretty sure I got herpes.â€ â€œHave you had sex recently?â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™ve never had it.â€ â€œThen how do you think youâ€“â€ â€œI just think I have herpes.â€ And so he goes, â€œAll right, take your pants down.â€ So I take my pants down, and he sits down, and rolls up one of those chairs, you know. And heâ€™s got my cock in his hands. Heâ€™s holding my cock. And he looks at it, and he goes, â€œYou know, thereâ€™s nothing here, Marc. Do you like coming here?â€ And that ended my hypochondriacal period. That was the end of that. Sealed. Nipped that in the bud. I should tell you the Viagra story now. Has to do with another doctor. I have doctor things. Some of you know that Iâ€™ve been divorced a couple times, and the divorce from the second wife was particularly horrible. And I remember, like, I was in the middle of that, and I had to get my checkup. You know, you got to get your yearly checkup. So I had a doctor here in town, Dr. Jay [bleep]. Maybe I should change his name. I think itâ€™ll be all right. I donâ€™t say anything bad about him. But he was, like, this 75-year-old guy. Classic, you know, old Jewish doctor. Heâ€™s the kind of guyâ€“ like a little Jewish Buddha. He looked like a well-worn piece of Semitic furniture. You know, heâ€™s the kind of guy you walk into his office, youâ€™re like, â€œHow you doing, Dr. [bleep]?â€ Heâ€™d say, â€œIâ€™m 75. How do I look?â€ You know, he was that guy. You know, and then by that point, like, you know, heâ€™d been doing some painting, so heâ€™d have to walk around his office, â€œIâ€™m painting now.â€ And heâ€™d have to walk around andâ€¦ â€œItâ€™s great. A watercolor of Jews at the Wall.â€ Soâ€¦ Iâ€™m broken up, you know. Iâ€™m, like, in the middle of this divorce. Iâ€™m heartbroken, you know? So, you know, we do the exam, you know, and heâ€™s very stealth about it. Thereâ€™s no big drama about theâ€“whatever. You know, he says, â€œYou know, whatâ€™s going on with you in your life, you know?â€ And I tell him about the divorce and everything, and heâ€™s like, â€œWell, thatâ€™sâ€â€“ I literally spent 20 minutes telling him about my heartbreak. And he looks at me, and heâ€™s also the kind of Jew that just, like, makes everything like an adage. You know, like, I goâ€“ I just lay it all out for him, and he looks at me and goes, â€œPeople make a mess.â€ You know, and then Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay.â€ And then he goes, â€œAt least you have your health.â€ So Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right, well, thatâ€™s good. Everything checks out.â€ And Iâ€™m walking out, and Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, thanks for listening, and thanks for the examination. People make a mess.â€ Iâ€™m actually repeating it to myself. â€œAt least I have my health.â€ And then as Iâ€™m walking out, he goes, â€œMarc, come back in here.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat? Whatâ€™s the matter? Is there a problem?â€ He goes, â€œSit down.â€ And I sit down. This little, old Jewish guy, he looks at me and goes, â€œHave you tried Viagra?â€ And, like, when youâ€™re a dude, you know, thereâ€™s part of you that thinks, like, â€œI donâ€™t need that. Iâ€™m fine. â€œMy angry Jew cock is in working order and seeking revenge on a weekly basis.â€ So I literallyâ€“I look at him. I go, â€œI donâ€™t need Viagra.â€ And his little Jewish man, his face lights up. He goes, â€œItâ€™s not about need. â€œThis is a great drug. No side effects. Itâ€™s terrific.â€ So now I got to picture him, you know, like, just thisâ€“ [laughs] This, like, weird little, you know, sack of sand with a protruding nub. You know, likeâ€¦ And he goes, â€œLet me give you a few.â€ So Iâ€™m like, â€œYou know, Iâ€™m a drug guy at heart.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right, didnâ€™t take myâ€“yeah. Iâ€™ll take some of these.â€ So I had, like, three of these fucking blue pills, you know, in a little sample pack, three or four of them, and I had never taken them before. I knew what they were supposed to do. I didnâ€™t, you know, ever take â€™em. I did a little research on them, you know? Do you know how much money those drugs make? I mean, they make millions of dollars. So in my mind, I was like, â€œWell, that means that, you know, â€œeveryoneâ€™s doing â€™em. â€œItâ€™s not just those people you see, you know, â€œdancing in their living room on the commercial â€œor holding hands in bathtubs â€œor getting onto motorcycles â€œwith too much gear at their age. â€œEveryone must be doing this. Everyone has at least tried it.â€ You know, so Iâ€™m just trying to justify it in my mind, you know? And then I started thinking, like, â€œWhy donâ€™t they market it to people like me? â€œI mean, Iâ€™m in trouble. Iâ€™m heartbroken. I fuckingâ€“Iâ€™m a mess.â€ And I pictured the ad campaign, you know. â€œViagraâ€“for when you want to fuck anything.â€ â€˜Cause, you know, you could be crying, just sort of like, â€œI donâ€™t know. I miss my wife. â€œThis feels weird. Okay, Iâ€™m ready. Sit on it.â€ â€œViagraâ€“ for when you want to fuck anything.â€ I tried â€™em. I tried â€™em a few times. Theyâ€™re dangerous, man. Have you ever done it? Have you ever? You got to do it at least once, â€™cause you donâ€™t realizeâ€¦ you know, whatever youâ€™re working with without them, itâ€™s fine, but on them, youâ€™re like, â€œOh, my God.â€ Itâ€™s almost like, when youâ€™re fucking on Viagra, thereâ€™s, like, a moment, like, where you look down at your cock and you think, â€œIt doesnâ€™t even need me.â€ Likeâ€¦ â€œLike, I wish I could just leave my body and sit over there â€œand jerk off to me doing this. Thatâ€™s how good Iâ€™m doing.â€ Yeah, soâ€¦ so donâ€™t get too caught up with that stuff, â€™cause itâ€™s a lie. [chuckles] But itâ€™s a fun lie. â€œSo, wait, where do you go from there, exactly, Marc? Why are you talking to yourself out loud?â€ Look, you guys, Iâ€™m not an alpha guy. I just want to put that out there. Like, I think I act like an alpha guy, but I donâ€™t think I am an alpha male, and I know that because when I lock eyes with a real alpha male, they know. I can read their face. Thereâ€™s that moment, theyâ€™re like, â€œSay hi to that little girl in there.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, fuck. They saw you. â€œThey saw you. â€œWalk away. â€œHeâ€™s gonna want to talk about sports. â€œWalk away. Gonna bring up extreme wanking.â€ But, yeah, Iâ€™m not that guy. Iâ€™m not a sports guy. I mean, I just wasnâ€™t brought up believing in it, andâ€¦ But thereâ€™s still part of me, itâ€™s weird. Iâ€™m 49. Thereâ€™s still part of me that if I see, like, four high school guys wearing varsity jackets, thereâ€™s still part of my brain that thinks, â€œOh, fuck, be cool. Just be cool.â€ Iâ€™m not even on their radar. I mean, like, unless itâ€™s for one of them to say, â€œWhy is that old guy acting weird?â€ You know, and in my brain, Iâ€™m like, â€œLeave me alone. Iâ€™m just going to my locker. Iâ€™m just going to my locker.â€ But, okay, letâ€™s get to sports. Iâ€™m not a sports guy for a very specific reason. I also think Iâ€™m a comedian for a very specific reason, and it has to do with my parents, â€™cause they can go fuck themselves. Look, if your parents ever sent you to more than one summer camp in the summer, it wasnâ€™t about you having a good time. They wanted you out of the house. They didnâ€™t want to deal with you anymore. And theyâ€™ll try to push it off on you, like, â€œYou need to learn new things.â€ And like, â€œWhen is a Jewish kid gonna need to ride a horse? â€œSeriously, when am I gonna need to ride a horse? â€œWhat situation will I ever be in â€œwhere Iâ€™m like, â€˜Thank God I went to that camp â€œâ€˜where they all made fun of me â€™cause I can ride this horse right out of hereâ€™?â€ My mother also found me a guitar teacher that was a guy who was married. They were these two Christian hippies, little chubby Christian hippies, and they would come, they would pick me up at school, they would take me to swim practice, they would take me out to dinner, and then theyâ€™d take me home to their house and teach me guitar. And my mother would say, â€œHow was your guitar lesson?â€ And I would say, â€œWith my other parents? It was fine.â€ My mother is a professional anorexic, and I say thatâ€“ I say that because itâ€™s her job. Itâ€™s not a sickness. She manages it. If you were to ask my mother, â€œWhat do you do for a hobby?â€ She would say, â€œI maintain a weight of 116 pounds.â€ And you would say, â€œThatâ€™s your life?â€ â€œYes, thatâ€™sâ€“all my life goes into that.â€ So thatâ€™s my mom. Thought itâ€™d be funnier. But Iâ€¦ â€˜Cause this next part really needs a buffer. I reallyâ€¦ I think for the first nine years of my life, I was a fat kid, and I really believe my mother just saw me as some sort of weird extension of her fat, and I think that she thought if she could just stop eating, then maybe the kid would disappear. [groans] I canâ€™t frame that any funnier. Butâ€“just saying it that time made me hurt a little bit. Letâ€™s get to the funny part. At some point my mother decided â€œMaybe we should put Fat Marcâ€â€“ she never referred to me that way out loud, but I could see it. â€œI think Fat Marc should be on peewee little league.â€ I showed no interest in sports. I didnâ€™t care about sports. I was not guided that way. I never played catch with my dad, because playing catch with my dad would have been like throwing the ballâ€¦ away. All right. So she puts Fat Marc on peewee little league. All right, now, when youâ€™re fat and youâ€™re on peewee little league, youâ€™re in the outfield, â€™cause no oneâ€™s going to hit that far, and if it does get out that far, itâ€™s gonna hit the ground and itâ€™s just gonna be bouncing. Itâ€™s not a big deal. So Fat Marc is out in center field. Got a fat left-fielder. Got the fat right-fielder. Weâ€™re just out there being fat. Weâ€™re the fat outfield. All right, maybe a little chatter, hitting the glove a little bit. â€œHey, batter, batter. â€œWhat does this even mean? Why are we saying this like this?â€ You know, maybe a little chitchat with the other guy. â€œHey, are you gonna get a Snickers or a snow cone after? â€œIâ€™m probably gonna get both. â€œIâ€™m gonna get a rainbow snow cone and try to eat it before it turns purple.â€ All right. And, look, I got to be honest with you. I was not proneâ€“you know, Iâ€™m fairly athletic. I could probably pull it off, but I was afraid of the ball, man. But, like, at that time, like, you know, battingâ€“ this is how I would bat. Catching. But this was me in the picture. [applause] All right, so hereâ€™s what happens, and this was a life-changing event. Weâ€™re gonna try and work through this. Iâ€™ve made a promise to myself to work through this. Iâ€™m out there in center field, just being fat. Weâ€™re having our time out there, all right? Weâ€™re just kicking the dirt around. And then I heard that sound. Itâ€™s an unmistakable sound. Everyone knows that sound. It was the crack of a bat. And my first reaction was to look at the other guy. And then I look over at that guy, and heâ€™s pointing at the air, and thereâ€™s a ball just suspended in the air, coming towards Fat Marc. The coach is saying, â€œGet under it! Get under it!â€ And Iâ€™m backing up, and I know this isâ€“ likeâ€¦ [groans softly] You know, itâ€™s right there. And then in my memory, there was a sprinkler, all right, thatâ€“my heel caught on a sprinkler. Iâ€™m pretty sure it was there, all right? I canâ€™t be sure. It might just be something I put in there toâ€“ you know, to buffer the shame of whatâ€™s going to happen next, which is me falling backwards onto the ground and the ball bouncing off of my face. So I was under it. I got that part of the equation correct. Now, in my mind, at that point, the coach is yelling, â€œGet up, you fat fuck! â€œField it, fatty! Come on!â€ Now, thatâ€™s obviously revisionism. I donâ€™t think a coach would talk that way to a fat kid, right? I probably made that up to make the shame worse. So now itâ€™s not really a ball game as much as it is a fat kid crying, which on some level, in my mind, is like, â€œWell, it was all about me for that time.â€ It would have been a better moment to be like, â€œI caught it. I caught it.â€ But, likeâ€¦ [wailing] Thatâ€™s all right? Like, on some level, if youâ€™re that self-absorbed and you want to be the center of attention, it succeeded in that way. But see, I really think, thoughâ€“ this is my point. I think if I would have caught that ball, I would have been a different person. I donâ€™t think I would be up here talking to you. I think I would have been a well-adjusted person. I would have felt that feeling of esteem and maybe gone on to play more sports. Perhaps I would have, you know, now been at a pretty good job with a family and had, you know, guy friends that I would say things like, â€œGood talk, bro.â€ You know? Like, it could have been a whole different life for me if I just caught that ball. And some part of me needs closure, so if you donâ€™t mind, I want to go through a psychodrama here where Iâ€™m going to walk Fat Marc off the field. Iâ€™m gonna walk Fat Marc off and just try to give him a heads up, which is a term he didnâ€™t understand at this point. Just try to, you know, give him a heads up for whatâ€™s gonna happen. So letâ€™s go there now. Iâ€™m gonna try to coach little, fat Marc. Here we go. Wow, that was ridiculous, what just happened. You were so close. You almost had that. You all right? Itâ€™s okay, though. Itâ€™s okay. Look, thereâ€™s a couple things I need to tell you about whatâ€™s gonna happen for you. First of all, thereâ€™s no going back to the dugout. This shit is done. Youâ€™re not gonnaâ€“thereâ€™s no more putting yourself in the position to be physically hurt. From here on out, itâ€™s all gonna be thinky pain. What else can I tell you? Teamworkâ€“thatâ€™s done. No more of that. No reason to believe in that shit. And quite honestly, from here on out, no sports heroes, not that you had â€™em to begin with, but here on out, just loners, fragmented people, drug addicts, people who live on the margins. Comedians, rock starsâ€“ those are your people. Get used to it. And also I guess I can tell you quite honestly, it doesnâ€™t get much better after this. On many different levels in your life, metaphorically, this situation will play out over and over again. Youâ€™re gonna very close to catching it, and then you will just end up crying. What else can I tell you about the immediate situation? Okay, youâ€™re gonna get off the field, your momâ€™s gonna take you to Dairy Queen, sheâ€™s gonna let you eat a banana split, youâ€™re gonna enjoy that, and an hour later, sheâ€™s gonna make you feel guilty about eating it. So thatâ€™s gonna happen. So quite honestly, sheâ€™s out too after this. You know, theyâ€™re both out. Mom and Dad are done. What else is gonna happen? Oh, at about 14 you start smoking cigarettes, which are really cool, but at 39 when you canâ€™t breathe, not so cool. Cocaine is gonna come into play, about 15 years old. Youâ€™ll commit to that for about nine years of your adult life, which will also be very exciting, but a mistake. I donâ€™t know, how can I sum this up? Okay, itâ€™s gonna take a lifetime to walk this off. And you can quit crying now on the outside. And I think the big payoff is that, eventually, you know, because of this moment that you had on this field, and, holy shit, and let me just look around for a minute. No sprinkler. Because of this moment here, youâ€™re gonna find yourself at age 49 on a stage in a basement in New York City in front of a room full of strangers, taping a special with no end to this story, really. Thereâ€™s no end. So if youâ€™d only caught that ball, weâ€™d have a little closure on this bit. Thank you. [applause] All right, Iâ€™m glad we did this in a little space. This is the way to do it. Like, part of meâ€“like, I think this is the way comedy is best. See, like, right here. You know, like that. I want to have that. I donâ€™t want to do it in a theater. â€˜Cause, like, all the specials that you see at theaters, itâ€™s like thereâ€™s 900 people, and, like, this notâ€“you know, comedy is not done like this: â€œHowâ€™s everybody doing? Whatâ€™s going on? â€œWhat do you say? Funny time! Ow!â€ All right, letâ€™s talk about love, and letâ€™s move through this stuff. All right, here we go. So Iâ€™m in a relationship now. Been married twice, divorced twice. Thatâ€™s fine. Iâ€™m over that shit. Got no problem with it. The first one I feel bad about. The second one, she can go fuck herself, but I donâ€™t feel that actively. Itâ€™s not an active aggravation that I have. Iâ€™m in a relationship right now with a girl who is significantly younger than me. Iâ€™m not bragging. Itâ€™s just the way it goes. All right? See, Iâ€™m 49, sheâ€™s 29. Thatâ€™s it. Itâ€™s out there. Donâ€™t judge me. Donâ€™t judge me. Do not judge old guys with young girls. Do not judge them, like you fucking know whatâ€™s going on. You donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on. I hate when people see an older dude with a younger woman, like, â€œI know what thatâ€™s about.â€ No, you donâ€™t. You donâ€™t know what itâ€™s about. What itâ€™s probably about is, that dumb old fuck is probably in love with her and heâ€™s doomed. If you ever see an old guy with a younger woman, just picture him as a doomed clown. Just look at him, like, wearing the clownâ€™s hat with a clownâ€™s nose, maybe the big clown shoes, and picture him maybe a few paces behind her, trying to keep up, saying things like, â€œWhatâ€™s this band called? â€œHow longâ€™s the show gonna go on for? Is this a seated event?â€ And then just see him slow down and she just walks away. He goes, â€œBye. Thanks for helping out.â€ [imitates horn honking] [hums whimsical carnival music] I know what this is about. I donâ€™t go after younger women. Itâ€™s just what Iâ€™m attracting right now. I donâ€™t attract age-appropriate women, thank God. I donâ€™t have anythingâ€“ and thatâ€™s not a dig on age-appropriate women. My mother still hangs on to the hope. Sheâ€™s like, â€œMarc, youâ€™re gonna meet an age-appropriate woman and be very happy.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHow is that possible? â€œHow am I gonna meet someone my age or within that age range â€œthat is not as fucked up as I am? â€œI mean, Iâ€™m a big bag of problems. â€œWhoever I meetâ€™s gonna be a reflection of that. â€œHow is that fun? What are we gonna do? â€œSit on a couch every night â€œand talk about how we fucked everything up, â€œhow we both failed? â€œAre we gonna have arguments â€œwhy I canâ€™t get along with her teenage son? â€œI mean, how does it play out in your mind? â€œAm I gonna be sitting there going, â€œâ€˜Because he can catch! Thatâ€™s why! â€œâ€˜Because he can catch. â€œâ€˜And he canâ€™t wear that fucking varsity jacket in my house. Oh, heâ€™s here. Just be cool. Be cool.'â€ My second wife was younger than me. Iâ€™ve been through this before. I know what itâ€™s about. Iâ€™ve been through this several times, the younger woman thing. I actually thought about having business cards printed up that just said, â€œMarc Maron: A phase youâ€™re going through.â€ â€œResolving daddy issues since 1989.â€ Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s about. Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s always about. Thatâ€™s what most of it is about. Come on. I know how this ends. Iâ€™ll finally get comfortable. My heart will be wide-open. Weâ€™ll just be sitting on a couch, watching Chopped or House Hunters, and out of nowhere sheâ€™ll just say, like, â€œYeah, itâ€™s weird. Iâ€™m getting along so much better with my dad now,â€ and Iâ€™ll be like, â€œOh, fuck. I guess Iâ€™m done. â€œMy work is finished. â€œNow itâ€™s time for you to move on â€œto an age-appropriate relationship and have some babies.â€ [woman groans in audience] Is that sad? I donâ€™t think itâ€™s gonna go that way with this one. I donâ€™t thinkâ€¦ Yeah, I think that was a hypothetical one. This oneâ€™s not going anywhere that quickly. I donâ€™t think I could get rid of this one if I had to. [laughs] Sheâ€™s fucking terrifying. Iâ€™m actively scared of her, and somehow in my mind Iâ€™ve decided, â€œWell, thatâ€™s healthy to be frightened, terrified, of the person you love.â€ Like, I think that if you were with somebody and youâ€™re not terrified of them, how is that gonna last? You know what I mean? How are you gonna behave properly if you are not terrified of them? What do you think, just intimacy and trust is gonna hold that together? But itâ€™s hard being older, because, like, you know that. Youâ€™re constantly reminded by the fact that weâ€™re with a younger person. â€˜Cause sometimes sheâ€™ll just hover over here by my head. Like, Iâ€™ll just feel her looking at the side of my head, and sheâ€™ll say something like, â€œOh, we got to do your ears.â€ How do I hear that as anything other than, â€œYouâ€™re old. Look at your hairy ears.â€ One time we were at a hotel, and I picked up something that I thought was a phone. It wasnâ€™t a phone, it was a remote control, but that didnâ€™t stop me from holding it up going, â€œIs this a phone?â€ And then she looked at me goes, â€œThatâ€™s the oldest thing you ever did.â€ Then I saw the regular looking phone right over there. Iâ€™ll tell you, thereâ€™s some couples shit thatâ€™s just soâ€“ I think itâ€™s soâ€“ like, I always think Iâ€™m, like, the only one, but itâ€™s just not. Like, sometimesâ€“ like, okay, look. The driving thing when youâ€™re in a couple, itâ€™s not good. One timeâ€“okay, look. She drives for her job. She works with emotionallyâ€“ severely emotionally disturbed or autistic children. Thatâ€™s what she does for a living, so sheâ€™s perfect for me, because thatâ€™s really who I am in there. Sheâ€™s actually said this to me, you know, earnestly, â€œUse your words. Use your words.â€ So sheâ€™s in the passengerâ€™s seat. Weâ€™re driving somewhere, so sheâ€™s got to be, like, control freaky about it. Weâ€™re on the highway, sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, you want to get in the other lane, because this lane turnsâ€“â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI know. I know how to drive. You know, Iâ€™ve been driving a long time.â€ You know, and sheâ€™s like, â€œOkay, okay.â€ And we keep driving, sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, you want toâ€“ you got to getâ€“â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI know whereâ€“ I know. Iâ€™ve been down this road,â€ but in my mind itâ€™s starting to be like, â€œShut the fuck up. You know, Iâ€™m not a fucking idiot.â€ You know, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going on in my head. Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou got to get off.â€ In my head Iâ€™m like, â€œGodâ€“what the fuck?â€ All I want to do is create tears, andâ€“ but I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t. This is the amazing thing about being a dude or being this dude, is, like, every time that I donâ€™t honor the part of me that wants to say, â€œShut the fuck up,â€ I think I deserve a medal. Like, literally, by the third time she talked, Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m doing a good job. â€œI think she should appreciate just how much Iâ€™m not making her cry right now.â€ So I keep it all to myself, and we finally get to where weâ€™re going, this art gallery. And now, look, I have a style of stopping. I generallyâ€“Iâ€™ll roll through a stop sign and look both ways and stop somewhere in the middle. You know? Itâ€™s gotten me two points away from losing my license, but I still commit to the style. So we made it through this whole drive without me fucking losing my mind, and I pull up to this crosswalk. I drift into the crosswalk. Weâ€™re right across the street from where weâ€™re going. And she goes, â€œYouâ€™re in the crosswalk! Youâ€™re gonna kill somebody!â€ And I just said, â€œShut the fuck up! â€œWeâ€™re not gonna be this couple! â€œWeâ€™re not gonna do this thing! â€œIâ€™m not gonna live like this. I mean, what are we, 50?â€ And, like, Iâ€™m a year away from 50, so, like, I thought fast, and Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are we, 65?â€ I said. By that point, like, I had lost. You know, I just looked like an idiot, and then all I could do was, like, dude brood. You know, just the sulking thing. What do we think weâ€™re accomplishing with that? I mean, I donâ€™t know if you do it, but, like, literally, theyâ€™re like, â€œItâ€™s okay.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, donâ€™t touch me.â€ You know, like, â€œEh.â€ She wants to have a baby. You think I should? [audience exclaims in agreement] [audience exclaims in disagreement] [laughter] I knowâ€“I somehow managed to be married twice and not have babies, but this one wants to have a baby. I know that â€™cause she says things like, â€œWhen are you gonna put a baby in me?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know, when you frame it differently maybe would beâ€¦â€ And also I donâ€™t want to do that to a kid. I mean, I think Iâ€™m too old, and people are likeâ€“ especially dudes are like, â€œWhat do you mean? Youâ€™re a dude. â€œYou can have babies as long as you have come in your balls that you can get out into the other thing.â€ Iâ€™m sorry. Didnâ€™t mean to get clinical. I apologize. And Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, not that. I just donâ€™t want to do that to a kid.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œLook, I remember the first time I met a kid with an old dad.â€ Donâ€™t you? It was awkward. Like, first grade or something. Youâ€™re both waiting for your parents to pick you up. Like, his dad comes, and youâ€™re like, â€œWhoâ€™s that?â€ The kidâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s my dad.â€ And, like, you canâ€™t even wrap your brain around it. Youâ€™re like, â€œWhat? How old is he?â€ â€œI donâ€™t even know.â€ â€œDoes he do anything?â€ â€œYeah, sometimes. I got to go. I got to help him.â€ I just donâ€™t want to do that to a kid for some reason. And, like, Iâ€™ve done a lot of jokes onstage that are a lot moreâ€“ like, Iâ€™ve done some wrong-minded shit in my life onstage, but that is the only joke that Iâ€™ve told and a woman has come up to me after a show crying, crying. â€œI had an old dad! And he was really nice!â€ So of course Iâ€™m thinking something must have happened. I mean, you got to think this through. You shouldnâ€™t be that upset about that joke, you know? â€œWhereâ€™d you say you were dancing tonight?â€ Umâ€¦ You know, maybe Iâ€™ll have a baby. I mean, I got to do itâ€“ I got to do it soon. Itâ€™d be good, right? They hang out, you know. I think Iâ€™d be a pretty good dad. Iâ€™m just very nervous and very panicky, a very worried guy. Like, even thinking about the baby, likeâ€“ â€œYeah, I could have a baby.â€ It goes right from there to â€œItâ€™s dead!â€ Like, thereâ€™s nothing in between those two things. â€œI think it would be wonderful to have a child.â€ â€œItâ€™s not breathing! What do I do?â€ But I know sheâ€™s probably the right girl, because we vacation together and we survive that. Thatâ€™s always dicey. Are you guys married? Yeah? Do you remember the first vacation? Horrifying, wasnâ€™t it? Did you do all right? You did all right? See, my whole thing was, like, lookâ€“ we have this system at home where, like, okay, weâ€™re playing pieces on this board that we understand. You have a sort of weird, kind of petty interactions that you get very predictable, and youâ€™re like, â€œOkay, Iâ€™m gonna say this. â€œSheâ€™s gonna do that. I hope she doesnâ€™t, like, threaten to leave now.â€ You know, that kind of stuff. So we didnâ€™t know where to go, and a lot of people were suggesting Cuba, which I didnâ€™t understand. What the fuck is wrong with hipsters? Like, â€œYeah, you got to go to Cuba.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy do I need to go to Cuba?â€ â€œBecause theyâ€™re gonna let capitalism in, and itâ€™s gonna change.â€ â€œSo youâ€™re saying I should go appreciate the charm â€œof a failed communist dictatorship? â€œYou want me to go experience that â€œbefore the people actually have a sense of self and pride or whatever?â€ Well, maybe thatâ€™s not what capitalism will bring, but you get what Iâ€™m saying. â€œThey make the cigars right there.â€ Look, I can be miserable and smoke a cigar anywhere. I donâ€™t have to go to the source of the cigars to do that. Some people are like, â€œYou should go to Kauai. Thereâ€™s nothing there.â€ Right? Thatâ€™s what people say. â€œItâ€™s great. Itâ€™s in Hawaii. Thereâ€™s nothing there.â€ Thatâ€™s the selling point. â€œReally? Nothing there?â€ â€œYeah, itâ€™s great. Thereâ€™s nothing there.â€ And then you go, and within three days, youâ€™re like, â€œThereâ€™s fucking nothing here!â€ So I donâ€™t know if you know anything about Kauai, but there are thousands of roosters. There are thousands of roosters, real, full-on fucking roosters. Not little roosters. The kind you see twice in a lifetime, because the bottom line is, there was nothing in Kauai, right? Portuguese ships would come and leave animals. There was nothing to eat â€™em, so now youâ€™ve got an explosion of roosters. The first time you see that many roosters, youâ€™re like, â€œThis is the sign of something bad.â€ But then youâ€™re like, â€œNo, thereâ€™s just a lot of roosters here.â€ Thousands of â€™em. And by day three, youâ€™re like, â€œAll right.â€ Youâ€™re used to it, but then you realize, â€œFuck. None of them know what time it is.â€ You know, itâ€™s like all day long. [imitates rooster crowing] Youâ€™re like, â€œItâ€™s fucking 3:30. â€œWhat is this bullshit? Is this what freedom does?â€ Theyâ€™re just out there like, â€œI donâ€™t work for the man! â€œ[imitates crowing] â€œI just woke up. Fuck you. Youâ€™re on my schedule, tourist.â€ And itâ€™s weird. I had a very poetic moment with a chickenâ€“ or a rooster, not a chickenâ€“ in Kauai. I had a very powerful moment with a rooster, and Iâ€™ll share it with you. Itâ€™s weird. When I said that line in North Carolina, that line, â€œI had a powerful moment with a rooster,â€ there was a dude in the audience that went, â€œYep.â€ And, like, in my mind, itâ€™s like, â€œHis storyâ€™s got to be better than mine.â€ â€˜Cause I just pictured a dude, like, â€œYeah, it was, like, in seventh grade. â€œI was horny, you know, â€œand I thought I could wrangle it, â€œand it was, like, weird, and thatâ€™s why I have one ball.â€ But I had a poetic moment with a rooster, and Iâ€™ll explain it to you. I was just on the balcony in Hawaii. I was looking at the roosters. Just me looking at roosters. And one of them had a fucked-up leg, but he didnâ€™t know he had a fucked-up leg. Heâ€™s a stupid rooster. Now, you know, these roosters are big. I have to assume thatâ€™s where the word â€œcockyâ€ came from. Roosters are pretty dramatic, you know, intense-looking things. And this guy has a fucked-up leg, but he doesnâ€™t know it, so he thinks heâ€™s still getting over, you know? So heâ€™s sort of like, â€œOh, yeah, look at me. â€œFuck yeah! Who wants a piece of this?â€ You know? And Iâ€™m just assuming all the chickens are like, â€œNo, that guyâ€™s got a funny frequency. â€œIâ€™m not gonna fuck that guy. â€œItâ€™s probably congenital, and I donâ€™t want my kids to walk like that.â€ But he doesnâ€™t know that. Theyâ€™re thinking, like, â€œI donâ€™t know if I can fucking invest my eggs in that fucking freak.â€ â€œCome on, baby! Who wants a piece of this?â€ So Iâ€™m projecting all this onto the situation. In my mind Iâ€™m like, â€œYou know, weâ€™re a lot alike, you and me, crippled rooster.â€ Iâ€™ve been to Kauai twice, with both of my ex-wives. All right? So I had a lot more baggage than we actually brought. So I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve been to Kauai, but people go on helicopters. Did you go on the helicopter? You didnâ€™t go? Why didnâ€™t you go? â€˜Cause itâ€™s ridiculous. Thereâ€™s no reason to go on a helicopter if youâ€™re not in combat. Thereâ€™s no reason. Itâ€™s not a recreational vehicle. Itâ€™s a dicey machine. But Iâ€™ve been on two. I went on a big one with my first wife, and I went on a smaller one with the German, the second wife. Now, Iâ€™m not even gonna explain that. The second oneâ€“ the second wife paid extra money to go on a Hueyâ€“ thatâ€™s the one with no doors. I remember it very well. If I were an alpha male and went out with this girlfriend, I would have been, â€œFuck you. Iâ€™m going on the helicopter, even if you donâ€™t want to.â€ And she didnâ€™t want to. She wanted to go on a boat. Fine. But that second helicopter, I remember that, â€™cause we were in there, strapped in, me, ex-wife, pilot, podiatrist, and his wife. My entire time Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t want to die with a podiatrist. You know, Itâ€™s not even a real doctor.â€ Soâ€¦ But I remember it, because the pilotâ€“ we got on, the pilot said, â€œI flew in â€˜Nam,â€ and Iâ€™m like, â€œNot a selling point,â€ you know what I mean? And I appreciate you had to do what you had to do, but are we gonna be dodging things only you can see? Is this a tactical mission away from your past? I mean, how is this gonna go? But I remember it because, like, we were flying on the Na Pali coastline, which is the most beautiful thing youâ€™ll ever see in your life, especially from that angle, and I was terrified. My leg was hanging out the door, and I remember â€™cause my wife was holding me with a concerned look on her face. I remember that because it was the only time I really saw it. That was the only thing. And I remember, like, seeing the most beautiful thing you ever saw in your life and being terrified more than youâ€™ve ever been in your life simultaneously was an amazing experience, â€™cause I remember the pilot goes, â€œPretty cool, huh?â€ And I think I went, â€œYes! â€œItâ€™s very nice! Please land the machine!â€ Because when Iâ€™m terrified, I turn into Gene Wilder. So my girlfriend wants to go on a boat. Okay, boatâ€™s fine. I can handle a boat, right? Boatâ€™s okay. So weâ€™re gonna go on a catamaran. You know what a catamaran is? I didnâ€™t know what it was. Itâ€™s the two things. Umâ€¦ Now, I didnâ€™t really know the kind of old Jew I was becoming, but this is the kind of old Jew Iâ€™m becoming. Weâ€™re supposed to get on a boat 6:30 in the morning, okay. At 12:30 at night I sat up in bed and said, â€œI need the pills! â€œI need the pills for the seasickness â€œor Iâ€™ll get sick on the boat. We got to get the pills.â€ And she goes, â€œCan we get them in the morning?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo! I donâ€™t know! I need â€™em.â€ So I put my shorts on, she puts her sweats on. We drive around the island of Kauai to 24-hour supermarkets, me walking in, going, â€œDo you have the pills for the seasickness?â€ Some guy behind me going, â€œFuck those shorts.â€ â€œI know you.â€ So we get the pills. We wake up. We get on the boat. All right? Itâ€™s fun. Thereâ€™s about 15 people. Itâ€™s a catamaran. You go, youâ€“ we go around the island. We saw porpoises. We saw sea turtles. I am capable of childlike awe. â€œLook at the turtle!â€ Okay, but then what happens is, the water gets rough. It gets rough. It seems dangerous to me. I knew I wasnâ€™t gonna die, but, you know, I was in a helicopter, but it was still rough, and it was bouncing, and everybody takes seats, and thereâ€™s no seats left for me. So now Iâ€™m the guy holding on to a pole. So now Iâ€™m this guy. I got a vest on, and Iâ€™m, like, sitting there, going, itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Like, and my girlfriendâ€™s sitting in a seat. She got a seat, so I keep checking in with her. â€œHey, baby, you okay?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m fine.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right. Iâ€™m not so good.â€ Yeah. And, like, three minutes later, Iâ€™m like, â€œYou okay, baby?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m fine.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right, Iâ€™m just over here.â€ And then Iâ€™m like, â€œAre you okay?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œShut the fuck up!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay.â€ And then I realize Iâ€™m that kind of guy. Like, if youâ€™re ever checking in with the person youâ€™re with over and over again, no matter what the situation is, all you should be saying is, â€œHelp me. Please help me.â€ I do it at home. I could be in the kitchen. Iâ€™ll be like, â€œWhere are you, baby?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m in the bedroom.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right, I was just feeling abandoned. Do you love me still?â€ All right. So now Iâ€™m all alone on this pole. Itâ€™s, like, connected to a platform where the captain is, and Iâ€™m just, like, holding on, and I noticed thereâ€™s two dude-dudes behind me, two alpha dudes. They werenâ€™t even wearing vests. They were just leaning against the back part, where the door goes under, right? Just leaning there. And then part of me is like, â€œOh, maybe those guys will take care of me.â€ You know? [laughs] â€œWill you guys be my friends?â€ You know? And I realize that they probably wouldnâ€™t, but I just thought Iâ€™d lean in and, like, listen to what theyâ€™re talking about, to maybe wedge myself into the conversation. And this is what transpired. Iâ€™m paraphrasing, but I swear to you, this is what happened. I leaned in, and Iâ€™m listening to them, and I hear the old one go, â€œSo you got a boat?â€ The young guyâ€™s like, â€œOh, yeah, we got a speed boat, â€œcouple Jet-Skis. We love it. We take it out all the time.â€ And, like, right away my brainâ€™s like, â€œHow do you even own a boat? â€œWhat do you do with it when youâ€™re not using it? â€œDoes it just sit out there? â€œDo you take it out of the water? â€œDo you hire somebody to take care of a boat youâ€™re not using?â€ By the time they had changed topics, I had sold my boat. All right. Then the next topicâ€“ swear to God, the next topic, the guy goes, â€œSo you got bikes?â€ And the young guyâ€™s like, â€œOh, yeah, we got dirt bikes. â€œPut â€™em on the trailer, take â€™em out, ride â€™em on the hills, take â€™em to jumps.â€ And the old guyâ€™s like, â€œYeah, I got speed bikes. I like going fast.â€ And in my mind, my dad was taking me to a hospitalâ€“ this really happenedâ€“ where he walked me up to the fourth floor, stood me in front of a dude in traction with pins sticking out of his legs and said, â€œMotorcycles.â€ Yeah, so that was that memory. So then the next topic wasâ€“ the old guy goes, â€œYou hunt?â€ And the young guyâ€™s like, â€œFuck, yeah. We go out for deer. We go out for elk sometimes,â€ and the old guyâ€™s like, â€œWe went out withâ€“ we nailed some bears up north once.â€ I swear I was waiting for one of these guys to go, â€œI killed a guy with my dick once. â€œYou know, by accident, you know. â€œI was just, you know, gutting a moose. â€œIt popped out. Took my buddy out, you know? â€œShit happens. He was wearing a vest. That didnâ€™t help out at all.â€ Lastlyâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna talk about pornography for a moment. Donâ€™t applaud it. Iâ€™m not here to celebrate porn. Iâ€™m here toâ€“ yeah, I use it occasionally, but thatâ€™s the way I want to frame it. I canâ€™t believe how much porn there is. Do you ever really sit and think just about how much fucking porn there is? Like, when did that happen? How did life become so glorious that thereâ€™s that much porn in the world? Could you imagine? If I were a 15-year-old boy in the culture that we live in now, my head would fucking explode. I would never leave my bedroom. Could you imagine? You would just be coming like a monkey. Iâ€™m 49. Do you know how hard it was to find porn when I was, like, 14, 15? I mean, you had to know a kid who had a weird brother or a dad with stash, and then youâ€™d have to keep lookout in front of a bedroom while he riffled through a mattress. You know? Or you had to find one page of a magazine under a bridge somewhere with your friends. Youâ€™d all stand there looking at it, like, â€œOh, man. Thatâ€™s how it works. I got a funny feeling in my pants.â€ And then you, like, go back there every day for a month to see if the rest of the magazine showed up. You know, as if there were porn trolls out distributing it at night. â€œPut more filth out for the children. â€œThey must learn somewhere. â€œCome. More bridges. Sunrise is soon.â€ It was hard to find, man, and I think some computers come with porn on them now. Like, you just pop open a new computer, theyâ€™re are people fucking on it. Iâ€™m justâ€“this is like a warning. I donâ€™t celebrate porn. You know, I use it. I just think you got to be careful. You donâ€™t want to be too excited about porn. Itâ€™s a drug, and itâ€™s dangerous, and Iâ€™ll establish that in the next few minutes. I mean, look. Like, if you ever are excited to the point where youâ€™re about to watch porn, and you go, â€œYes,â€ youâ€™re already in trouble. Youâ€™re in trouble. You shouldnâ€™t be that excited about it. I think the moment that you decide to watch porn, you should probably be working on something else. Youâ€™re alone in your office or your home office, and youâ€™re just, like, plugging away at something and you have that moment, youâ€™re like, â€œOh, fuck this. â€œThis is bullshit. â€œIâ€™m not gonna finish this. â€œThis isnâ€™t my fucking life. Why am Iâ€“oh, fuck it.â€ Ding. â€œAhh.â€ Thatâ€™s when you should watch porn, when youâ€™re falling down the pit of self, and the only thing you can do to stop your fall is to grab hold of your cock. Nowâ€“and Iâ€™m sorry if this is specific. A woman came up to me, and sheâ€™s like, â€œYou know, women watch porn too.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, but Iâ€™m not in a position â€œto really mock that when Iâ€“ I canâ€™t sit up there and likeâ€¦â€ Do you remember the first time you saw a woman masturbating, like, in person? You were like, â€œOh, my God. That thing can really take a beating.â€ You know, as a dude, you were sort of like, â€œOh, I want to take care of that fragile flower,â€ and theyâ€™re like, â€œNo! No! â€œWeâ€™re driving somewhere. Get on it! Ahh!â€ Holy fuck. Um, so what am I saying? Oh. Just donâ€™t watch too much, â€™cause youâ€™ll get porn brain, and itâ€™s likeâ€“ itâ€™s a condition that I think Iâ€™ve, you knowâ€“ Iâ€™ve diagnosed. Like, I think that, like, you should just keep it in check. Like, never download porn. Always go to free sites for the humility of picking a clip. Itâ€™s very important to be very aware of who you are and what youâ€™re doing when youâ€™re picking your clip. You know, make sure your lower self is obviously engaged, but donâ€™t let your higher self get too far away. Let it hover. And just look down on yourself as youâ€™re sitting there alone, going, â€œUh. â€œOh, fuck. Thatâ€™s pretty good. â€œOh, how many people are in there? â€œThatâ€™s not a real strip club. â€œWhere the fuck is that wallpaper from? â€œThatâ€™s some weird Baltic porn or something. â€œOh, shit. Thatâ€™s the one. â€œOh, bookmark it. Save her for when you finish. There might be a better one.â€ And donâ€™t be afraid to let your higher self rise up out of you and look down upon you in judgment and say, â€œLook at you, little man! â€œLocked in a cage of self, â€œhitting a button for pleasure like a rat, â€œyou sad little man. Tragic.â€ But donâ€™t be afraid to look up at him and go, â€œShut the fuck up! Iâ€™m doing this now. â€œIâ€™ll hook up with you again later. Donâ€™t be a buzzkill, fuckface.â€ Nowâ€¦ the bigger point Iâ€™m trying to make is, I donâ€™t think that our brains are equipped to take in as much fucking as weâ€™re allowed to take in on porn, all right? Weâ€™re just people. Like, if you sit and watch porn, like, if youâ€™re compulsive about it, like, in a half hour you can watch at least 15 different sexual situations. How is our brain meant to handle that? I mean, weâ€™re just animals. I mean, even if youâ€™re a fucking monkey and youâ€™re up in a tree and thereâ€™s a couple of sets of monkeys fucking, I mean, youâ€™re, like, â€œAll right, thatâ€™s two. Thatâ€™s plenty.â€ You know, like, but if there were 20, youâ€™d be like, â€œWhat the fuck is happening to the monkeys?â€ Soâ€¦ So Iâ€™m just saying, it fucks with your head, and I think that weâ€™re doing damage. Let me try to illustrate it another way. Letâ€™s create an analogy. All right, youâ€™re at the endâ€“ youâ€™re at the end of a hallway. It looks like a hotel hallway. Thereâ€™s 15 doors, and theyâ€™re all open. And in each one of the rooms, there are people fucking somehow, all right, and you start jerking off at the end of the hallway, and then you just stand in front of every door going, â€œHoly shit. What the fuck is that? â€œHow many people are in there? Thatâ€™s not a real strip club.â€ And then you just come on the floor at the end of the hallway. If that day happened in your life, you would never forget it as long as you live. But, no, now you can just do that in a half hour right at your fucking desk, and you think itâ€™s not fucking with your head? Donâ€™t get porn brain. Hereâ€™s how you know if you have porn brain. If you ever detach from the porn long enough to have a real sexual experience, if you ever walk into a room with a person that youâ€™re with that youâ€™re about to have sex with, and for a split second when you walk into that situation you think, â€œWhereâ€™s the other guy?â€ Youâ€™ll have porn brain. You know? If you go for that split second, youâ€™re like, â€œOh, fuck, itâ€™s me. This is an interactive thing. There is no other guy. Iâ€™m the guy.â€ Thatâ€™s when you know when youâ€™ve watched too much.
Thank you very much, folks. Youâ€™ve been great. Thank you. I appreciate you coming out. Thank you.
[cheers and applause]
[indistinct chatter] Oh, my God. That was pretty good.
Hey, Marc.
Yeah?
That was incredible, man.
Thank you. We good? We good?
Did it.
We did it. That one felt good, man.
Oh, my God.
Soâ€“okay, so you think we did all right?
Oh, yeah. It was awesome. It was a triumph.
Thankâ€“yes!
Itâ€™s a triumph.
We triumphed.
You triumphed.
You triumphed.
Own it.
We sat around, talking shit.
No, you definitely could have done it without us.
Okay. But hereâ€™s howâ€“this is what I learned from my mother. You always punctuate a declarative with a question. â€œI triumphed. Right?â€
[laughs]
Um, so how are the kids?
Theyâ€™re doing great.
You know, I got to do it. Iâ€™ve got a window till July. She wants me to start pumping the stuff into her in July.
The soylent green?
Yeah. I hope better than that. I noticed that guys who donâ€™t have kids, after a certain age, thereâ€™s something wrong with them, I think, a little bit. Like, Iâ€™m already self-centered, so I think it can only get worse. If I donâ€™t have kids, what have I contributed? What am I gonnaâ€“like, â€œHereâ€™s my DVD from that special I did. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve offered the world.â€ Why not have some other fucked-up thing in the world?
Another mouth for the world to feed.
Yeah, thatâ€™s the other side of it too.
Thatâ€™s the other side.
Yeah. I just wonderâ€“ â€“ Well, you could say, â€œMy kidâ€™s gonna be the one that cures cancer.â€
Do people still say that kind of stuff?
Or, you know, â€œMy kidâ€™s gonna be the one that causes a lot of cancer.â€ You just donâ€™t know. President of some chemical corporation or something.
Could go either way. Or just some, you know, random drug addict.
Right.
[laughing] All right, good.
Excellent. Letâ€™s cut.
<END>

<START>
Join me in welcoming the author of six number one â€œNew York Timesâ€ bestselling books, the star of â€œChelseaâ€, â€œChelsea Doesâ€, â€œChelsea Latelyâ€ and â€œHello, Privilege. Itâ€™s Me, Chelsea.â€ Please put your hands together for Chelsea Handler.
Yeah! Whatâ€™s up, New Jersey? Iâ€™m so happy you came out tonight with me. Look at this beautiful train station. Built in 1889 for immigrants. Remember when that was cool? I decided to wear white tonight, â€™cause Iâ€™m expecting my period. Before we get startedâ€¦ Hi, ladies. Hi, everybody. So nice to be out! I wanna make a serious announcementâ€¦ to my husband, if he happens to be sitting in this audience tonight. My future husband, sorry. I wanna dedicate this show to him. But there seems to be a misconception, and I get this a lot from white men. Hereâ€™s a Black man and a white man together. Perfect! Letâ€™s talk to you together. There seems to be a misconception that I only date Black men. So I wanna use this opportunity to make a PSA for white men who are scared of women who have dated Black guys. Beavers retract. They donâ€™t just stay open. They go back to simpler times.
I went through a difficult time about three or four years ago, whenever the last election was. I couldnâ€™t believe that we elected that fucking baboon! And when you live in Los Angeles, as I do, when youâ€™re going through a difficult time and you have high levels of rage or outrage or anger, however you want to frame it, people wanna talk to you. And they wanna use words like â€œmanifestâ€â€¦ and â€œgratitudeâ€â€¦ and â€œkaleâ€. And Iâ€™m not into shit like that. Iâ€™m all for spiritual people, or spirituality, I should say. Spirituality is fine with me as a component of your lifestyle. Sure, go for it. My problem with spiritual people is that spiritual people can sometimes be giant fucking assholes. I feel spiritual when Iâ€™m on mushrooms. Iâ€™m not into rocks and stones and chakras or walking into Whole Foods, hearing phrases like â€œartisanal deodorantâ€â€¦ or â€œmicro panic attackâ€. Itâ€™s like, fuck you! Thatâ€™s a micro panic attack. Los Angeles is a tricky place if youâ€™re going through a vulnerable time. And if youâ€™re not careful, you could end up at one of those silent retreats in the woods of Topanga Canyon, finger blasting yourself all weekend long. Thatâ€™s what happened to me. I had a girlfriend who came to visit me from high school, from Nueva Jersey. Thatâ€™s Spanish for â€œNew Jerseyâ€. De nada. Any other questions about Spanish?
And she was hanging out with me for a couple of days, and after hanging out with her, I said, yeah, I would be willing to go to a silent retreat. And we went. And it was exactly what I had imagined. It was in the woods of Topanga Canyon. And we get there and thereâ€™s just girls everywhere and Lululemon everywhere. Leggings and deep stretching for no reason. A lot of room-temperature water. That annoys me. As if water could get any more boring, letâ€™s heat that shit up and hand it out.
And there were three veterinarians alone in a circle. Iâ€™m like, thatâ€™s suspicious to me. I donâ€™t like to see vets out of office. And not running in packs, either. I have a problem with vets. I respect what theyâ€™re trying to do. The intentionâ€™s nice. You wanna work with animals, great. Theyâ€™re just too vague. All of their answers are too vague. Iâ€™ve had too many rescue dogs, Iâ€™ve had seven or eight, and Iâ€™ve brought them in every single time to find out how old they are. And no matter what vet Iâ€™m seeing, the answer is the same. â€œTheyâ€™re somewhere between the ages of 4 and 12â€. What kind of answear is that? What kind of margin of errorâ€¦ Are you a doctor or not? We know that kangaroos were alive on the island of Australia 25 million years ago because of a half of a tooth. And you canâ€™t tell me how old this fuckinâ€™ chow chow is? Honestly, go fuck yourselves.
So anyway, weâ€™re at this retreat, and I was already have the attitude that Iâ€™m not into this stuff, but I was trying to be open minded because of the level of my outrage. So then, I heard that thereâ€™s gonna be a sound bath. I didnâ€™t knowâ€¦ In the woods. I didnâ€™t know what a sound bath was. I thought, â€œDJâ€™s will shower with us.â€ And we go up to the woods and thereâ€™s more stretching, camel toe everywhere. So annoying. Kale chips. Iâ€™m like, itâ€™s 85 degrees. Who wants to suck on a kale chip? Then I saw a ukulele. Iâ€™m like, no, you donâ€™t. I know that is gonna end up somewhere that Iâ€™m not gonna like, okay. This is classic, classic finger blasting setting. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on my Pikachu. So I walked out, and I found some other girl. I left the woods and Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatâ€™s up? Whoâ€™s got drugs?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWeâ€™re having a ceremony tomorrow nightâ€ â€œwith toad venom, and itâ€™s called 5-DME-OT.â€ And I was like, â€œOkay, Iâ€™ll take mine now.â€ Letâ€™s party. And she said, â€œItâ€™s not really that kind of drug.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œListen bitch, Iâ€™ll decide what kind of drug this is.â€
I understand some people are not built for drugs and alcohol, and I respect that. I donâ€™t ever want to get anybody involved with drugs and alcohol that canâ€™t handle it, but I believe that I am. I believe that Iâ€™m built for the apocalypseâ€¦ which, by the way, weâ€™re in. Iâ€™ve done every drug. Iâ€™ve experimented with everything. Unless thereâ€™s a new drug that came out this morning, Iâ€™ve tried it. I did a special on Netflix. I went down to Peru and did ayahuasca on camera with a shaman, and they said, â€œNo, you canâ€™t do that.â€ â€œPeople vomit and shit their pants.â€ I was like, â€œI wonâ€™t do that. Iâ€™m too advanced.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYou think Iâ€™m gonna ruin a buzz by defecating on myself?â€ â€œNever is that going to happen.â€ I took my SATs tripping on acid. I didnâ€™t get into college, but I had a great time taking that test. And Iâ€™ve never had a bad time. Like everybody always has a bad time with drugs. Thereâ€™s always a girl in the corner for eight hours, likeâ€¦ Thatâ€™s never me. Iâ€™ve had never a bad experience. Nothing that I would frame as negative, anyway.
The one time, I had a questionable experience. This was 15 years ago, before cannabis was the way it was, before there were labels. And a man had given me a cookie. And I ate that cookie. And I thought I was at a movie theater. And when the movie ended, I got up to leave the movie theater, only to find out I was on an airplane. That was shocking. â€˜Cause I didnâ€™t just get up; I got my shit together. I got my coat, and it had a belt. It must have been winter. And then I got my bag out of the overhead bin and pulled it down as if thatâ€™s how you leave a movie theater. It never occurred to me this isnâ€™t what youâ€™ve ever done leaving a theater before. It was rote. I was like, â€œI better get my bag.â€ â€œI better get my things.â€ And then I was like, yeah. Up the aisle, straight to the little window that you look out if youâ€™re trying to escape. And Iâ€™m looking at the other passengers like, what are these idiots waiting for, the credits? I was staring out that little bagel window, and then I feel tap, tap, tap. And I turn around, and the flight attendantâ€™s like, â€œSweetie, there are three more hours left on this flight.â€ And I was like, â€œI knowâ€. I was like, â€œIâ€™m going to the bathroom to change.â€ Just layered on my lies. I was like, â€œYouâ€™re not gonna shame me.â€ And then I walked up to the bathroom and shoved my suitcase inside. Apparently not only was I not at a movie theatre I had never flown on an airplane before, and knowing that you canâ€™t bring your suitcase into that little urine-soaked wet box and change your outfit, but I did. I put on a tube top to prove a point. And I walked back out with my head held high. I was like, do not make eye contact! You are a queen! I sat back down in my seat, and I was like, â€œWhatâ€™s next?â€ Itâ€™s like, this is like an adventure. I wonder where Iâ€™m going. And whoâ€™s gonna pick me up when I get there? And then I put in another movie, and I watched that. And when that ended, I was like, â€œDo not get up, bitch.â€ And then I wrote on a piece of paper, â€œYou are on a plane.â€ Itâ€™s not like you can look over at your neighbor and be like, â€œSpeaking of nothing, where are we headed?â€
Anyway, so, that was the worst experience Iâ€™ve ever had, and I would frame that as a B-plus. Iâ€™m back at the retreat and this woman, I donâ€™t remember her name, who had the toad venom, weâ€™ll call her Sierra Mist. So she and I are walking down to this cottage to do it, and then this other dipsy doodle comes running out of the bushes and sheâ€™s like, â€œAre you guys getting high?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBack the fuck up.â€ First of all, I donâ€™t like interlopers, you know what I mean? I donâ€™t wanna do drugs with somebody if itâ€™s their first time. I donâ€™t have time for that shit.
And a lot of people depend on me because Iâ€™m a pharmacological intuit. I could look at you and say, â€œYouâ€™re gonna thrive on this drug,â€ â€œyouâ€™re gonna do better on Xanax, you might prefer a Vicodin,â€ â€œyou might like an Adderall.â€ I can tell by looking at your body and talking to you for five minutes what drug you are going to respond to. Donâ€™t talk to me about melatonin either, people. Melatonin is for beginners. Talk to me after youâ€™ve taken an Ambien and woken up at a Harrahâ€™s blackjack table, $500 up, with your eyeshades on. Then you can talk to me about fuckinâ€™ melatonin. So a lot of people know this about me. My sister she had trouble making speeches at work, â€™cause she would get dry mouth. So I prescribed her Propranolol. A beta blocker. I said, â€œTake one 30 minutes before you speak publicly.â€ Sheâ€™s been promoted twice. She called me. Sheâ€™s like, â€œThank God we have a doctor in the family.â€ Magnesium 07 by Aerobic Life for women who have trouble going to the bathroom. A lot of women have trouble going to the bathroom every day. If you take three of those every night for three nights, you would have solid shidoobees for the rest of your life. If you take 4, you will get diarrhea. Some girls like that. If you do, take four. Youâ€™ll get it. Doxycycline will kill anything in your system. Acne and malaria. 2 doxycycline twice a day for 10 days. Never on an empty stomach. Youâ€™ll vomit, okay? It will knock anything out of your system. I take one every morning just not to fuck around. I looked at this girl, this other 7UP Light girl that came out of the woods, and I could tell by her body type that I didnâ€™t want her to rain on my party.
And a lot of people think, heavier or taller people can handle more drugs and alcohol. That is not true either. Itâ€™s those skinny little bitches you have to watch out for, the ones who can do coke all night and then take one of those Lime scooters to work in the morning. I said, â€œListen, Iâ€™m gonna do this, sweetie, and Iâ€™ll get back to you.â€ So I go down with Sierra, we go to this cottage, and sheâ€™s like, â€œOkay, you know, this is gonna be about 10 or 12 minutes.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat?â€ Like, Thatâ€™s not fun, 10 or 12 minutes. I go, â€œJust give me a double dose.â€ And she said, â€œNo, why donâ€™t you try it first?â€ â€œItâ€™s transcendental,â€ is the word that she used. So I was already bored. And then she said, â€œYou need to set an intention.â€ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t care.â€ â€œWhy donâ€™t you set one for me.â€ And she said, â€œYou need to set it.â€ Iâ€™m like, To be less of a cunt, okay? Is that an intention? â€˜Cause I would like to do that.â€ So I take a hit, and itâ€™s in, a little crack pipe, or whatever. I take a hit, and itâ€™s immediately terrible. Like, the most terrible thi-dark, swirly greens and purples. It was like I was on a roller coaster and my head was in a vice and I couldnâ€™t move. And then I open my eye; Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck. Sheâ€™s still here.â€ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t like this, I donâ€™t like this,â€ and I was like, â€œYouâ€™re gonna pass away today.â€ Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening.â€ And then Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, donâ€™t be so dramatic.â€ â€œYouâ€™re not gonna pass away. Youâ€™ve received brain damage,â€ â€œbut youâ€™re already a little bit on the spectrum, so donâ€™t even worryâ€â€¦ not that people on the spectrum have brain damage, but I definitely have it, and Iâ€™m on some spectrum.
Iâ€™m sitting there, and I am sweating, just drenched in my own sweat. Iâ€™m ripping my clothes off and Iâ€™m hyperventilating and Iâ€™m like, â€œDonâ€™t say anything.â€ And when I couldnâ€™t wait anymore, I was like, â€œYou have to make this stop. Iâ€™m in a matrix.â€ And she puts her hand on my chest in between my naked boobs and sheâ€™s like, â€œItâ€™s okay. Youâ€™re in a parallel universe.â€ I was like, â€œBitch, I donâ€™t have any Bitcoin. Get me out of there.â€ And finally, I started to come out of it, and I was so, first of all, embarrassed, â€™cause I was nude. That I had lost complete control. I was like, â€œMy God.â€ And I open my eyes and I look at her and I look down at my body and I was completely nude. I had forgotten that, that morning, I had put on nude underwear. So when I looked down, I just saw a bald bump. And I was like, â€œYou shaved my beaver. I knew something like that was gonna happen this weekend.â€ I had to get my stuff together, like with the walk of shame in the morning. Turning away from her when sheâ€™s already seen my nude body. Iâ€™m covering myself, picking up my clothes. And then Iâ€™m like, â€œThank you.â€ â€˜Cause thatâ€™s what girls do. We say thank you even when weâ€™ve had a terrible time. I did it two more times, and Iâ€™m like, â€œI definitely donâ€™t like this.â€
And then my curiosity had reached its conclusion. And I figured it was time to go to a real therapist. I needed to talk to somebody, but I was embarrassed that I needed to talk to somebody. I had seen doctors and therapists before, but never with the intention of fixing anything that really ran deep. I didnâ€™t have the mental equipment to let anyone see me for anything other than what Iâ€™d become, which was strong. And because of that strength, I wasnâ€™t about to sit in a doctorâ€™s office and cry. Crying for other people, my friends, about their problems, sure. But crying for myself about myself was absolutely out of the question. So I sat down, this guyâ€™s name is Dan, heâ€™s a psychiatrist, and I said, â€œI have a lot of anger and outrage about Donald Trump,â€ â€œand people are running when they see me coming.â€ â€œIâ€™m losing friends. Iâ€™m losing family members.â€ He said, â€œLetâ€™s talk about that.â€ I said, â€œI travel a lot.â€ â€œIâ€™m in airports a lot. And I check in to the first-class lounge,â€ â€œand then I immediately go over to the Fox News sectionâ€ â€œand start going off on people.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYou fuckinâ€™ racist!â€ And then I run out. And then I come back and Iâ€™m like, â€œDo you have a daughter that doesnâ€™t have any rights? â€˜Cause she wonâ€™t.â€ And then I run back in; Iâ€™m like, â€œAre you still a racist?â€ Dan is really understanding, heâ€™s like, â€œItâ€™s a really tricky time right now.â€ â€œEmotions are high. A lot of people are enervated.â€ I said, â€œDan, I went to the airport today, and I didnâ€™t have a flight.â€ I told him that, before the election, my biggest privileged decision was whether or not to install a waterslide off of my bedroom balcony into my pool for the next time my friends and I did molly. And then I told him, the day after the election, Iâ€™m driving around the streets of Bel Air, where I live, passing out water bottles and blankets to the Mexican workers in my neighborhood, going, â€œYou belong here!â€ And them looking at me like, â€œWeâ€™re not all illegal, you racist bitch.â€ Cheers! I told him I had read this book by Viktor Frankl called Manâ€™s Search for Meaning, and in the book there was a line that made me put the book down. And the line said, â€œStop thinking about what you expect out of life, and start thinking about what life expects out of you.â€ I was like, â€œWhat?â€ Iâ€™d never thought about what life was expecting from me. I was thinking about what I was gonna get, always about me and my family and my friends and my homes, my vacations. I was taking, without thinking about my contribution.
And I told Dan, I said, â€œI have to do better. I wanna do better; I need somebody to help me do better.â€ I said, â€œBut I feel so hopeless,â€ â€œI had read an article that men were masturbating into plants.â€ Thatâ€™s happening. When did that start? Please stand up if youâ€™ve done that and explain it. Please, get up. If somebodyâ€™s done that here, you need to come forward. Why did that start? I mean, honestly, guys, only a man would do such a thing. Poor plants. Theyâ€™ve been sitting around for how many millions of millennia, minding their ownâ€¦ giving us air to breathe. And then cavemen come running along with their dicks waving, and plants are like, â€œMy God. What is gonna happen now?â€ â€œAre we gonna get ejaculated on?â€ Talk about picking a victim that canâ€™t get away. Sickos. Only a man would see a plant and be likeâ€¦ Only a man would do that. No woman has ever done it. In the history of the world, no woman is like, â€œWhereâ€™s a cactus?â€ Never! Never ever, ever. Not one time. Iâ€™m willing to vouch for all women everywhere. Not in the history of the world or in the future history of the world will a woman ever have said that she has done that or will we catch one doing it.
That was a disappointing revelation. Itâ€™s not like women donâ€™t get turned on at inappropriate times. We do. I get a manicure and a pedicure every week. And she does that forearm massage this spot right here is my sweet spot. When somebody touches that, Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ I flutter my eyes, start to twitch, and Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ And then Iâ€™m like, open your eyes. Youâ€™re at a nail salon. You canâ€™t do that right now. Youâ€™re in public, you sick bitch. You canâ€™t audibly moan while youâ€™re getting a massage. Thatâ€™s not okay. And in that moment, when she does that, Iâ€™m vulnerable. I would like it to continue in different ways, maybe. When she does the little dipsy doo, if sheâ€¦ even if in that moment, if she tried to just go a little bit too far, like, up the leg, and a little dipsy doodle, like, a littleâ€¦ Itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the water spout. Down came the rainâ€¦ If in that moment she did do that, I might be like, â€œYeah, quick.â€ â€œDo it, get in, quick, before anybody else walks in.â€ I might even return the favor. I doubt it, but I might.
Iâ€™m talking to my new psychiatrist about this. And I was like, â€œDan, Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™m lit.â€ â€œYou know, I know Iâ€™m, like, woke, and I know my shit.â€ Iâ€™d started filming a documentary for Netflix about white privilege. And on the very first day of shooting, Netflix called me and said I had to go to sexual harassment training. I was likeâ€¦ again? And I had been on set and this Black woman sang this song and I went to go hug her and after I hugged her, I smacked her on the ass. I said, â€œWay to go, sister.â€ She did not like that. But I didnâ€™t understand why I had to go to sexual harâ€¦ I was like, â€œWhy is this sexual harassment? Iâ€™m not hitting on her. Iâ€™m straight.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œNo, itâ€™s not about that. You have to call this woman and apologize to her, and you have to get her to accept your apology.â€ And I was likeâ€¦ and I was defensive. And so I called her, and I was like, â€œI was just trying to say,â€ â€œâ€˜Hey, go girl.â€™ Like, sisterhood.â€ And she said, â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter what your intention was. â€œItâ€™s how I received it, and youâ€¦ Black women have been defined by their hair and their asses since the beginning of time. You have no right to touch my body.â€ And she was right. I have no right to touch her body or anybody elseâ€™s. So I was sitting there talking to Dan, and I was like, â€œBut can I still touch white people?â€ And he said, â€œNo, no, you canâ€™t touch anyone, Chelsea. Itâ€™s unwelcome.â€ And I was like, â€œBut thatâ€™s how my family and I communicate.â€ I see my sister, I grab her by the Pikachu. Iâ€™m like, â€œBeep, beep!â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou definitely shouldnâ€™t be doing that with family.â€
And that was a wake-up call, â€™cause she was right and I was wrong. Itâ€™s not about your intention; Itâ€™s about the reception. And any time youâ€™re defensive, especially about racism, youâ€™re fuckinâ€™ wrong. If youâ€™re a person who doesnâ€™t think that â€œwhite privilegeâ€ is a real thing, then youâ€™re a person whoâ€™s choosing to be part of the problem rather than being part of the solution. Because the world is only getting browner and gayer, so you better hop on board. So that was lesson number one, but not from Dan, but I talked it through with him. And then he wanted to know about my family history. I was like, thatâ€™s not what this is about. Nothin to see there. I was like, my brother died when I was a little girl; My mom died, like, 8 or 10 years ago; My dadâ€™s a huge pain in the ass, so hopefully heâ€™ll wrap things up. And I said, â€œAnd quite frankly, like, Iâ€™m ready to wrap it up, too.â€ I said, â€œDan, Iâ€™m not suicidal. You donâ€™t have to worry about it. But people say life is too short. I think itâ€™s too long.â€ Thereâ€™s so many annoying people out here and I just canâ€™t deal with it. I said, â€œIâ€™m losing my patience, and I need you to help me with my lack of patience.â€ And he said, â€œOkay. Give me some examples of your lack of patience.â€ I was at a table like this, probably a little bigger, with three of my girlfriends before my session that day with Dan. My girlfriend orders a turkey burger, no onion, no bun, no cheese. Thatâ€™s fine. We live in LA. So the server comes over with his hands full, with four plates, and comes over and weâ€™re all sitting at a table. Weâ€™re not even talking. And he says, â€œTurkey burger? Who ordered the turkey burger, no onion, no bun, no cheese?â€ And my friend is just sitting there like Stevie Wonder playing the piano. And he says it again, louder, â€œTurkey burger. No onion, no bun, no cheese.â€ And this is her. I go, â€œHey, you fucking cunt! Wake up! Is that your turkey burger? You canâ€™t order that and then forget that you ordered that.â€ I said, â€œSo thatâ€™s one example. Would you like to hear another?â€ He said, â€œYes, please go on.â€ I said, â€œAirports, airports. I canâ€™t deal with the people that work at Hudson Booksellers. Whatâ€™s wrong with those people? Whatâ€™s up with the slowness of the transaction? I canâ€™t deal with the slowness of the transaction â€œwhen I wanna buy a book. Are those peopleâ€¦ Are they koala bears?â€ He said, â€œHow do you handle that?â€ I go, â€œI have to shoplift. I have to.â€ â€œI get the book, and I wave it to the security cameraâ€¦â€ Always, I always say, â€˜Hey, itâ€™s me, Chelsea Handler, Iâ€™m taking this â€™cause your koala bear is on a branch somewhere in the back.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m gonna leave 40 bucks here, and hopefully theyâ€™ll find it when she comes out from her nap, if sheâ€™ll find it before a stranger does, but itâ€™s on this bookshelf. I didnâ€™t steal. Iâ€™m leaving,â€ and then I skedaddle. And Dan was looking at me when I said that. I was like, â€œWhat? Is that white privilege too?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, Chelsea. White people arenâ€™t even doing that.â€ I told him, anything hotel related, â€œI spend tons of times in hotels,â€ and I get home at, like, 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, â€œI want my snack. I call down,â€ I order what I want from room service, and thatâ€™s too slow.â€ At 1:30 in the morning, there should be, like, a double speed, where people are quicker and more alert, or just quicker. Then they wanna repeat the order back to me. Itâ€™s like, please, whatever you think you heard, just bring double. And donâ€™t say â€œchicken fingersâ€ out loud again. Iâ€™m 45 years old. I donâ€™t wanna have this conversation. Do you know how humiliating it is to call you in the first place and order this at 1:30 in the morning? And now you wanna go over it and shame me again? Just bring them. And then they bring them and thatâ€™s a whole episode in and of itself. Itâ€™s like, with the cart and the fork and the knife and they set me up like Iâ€™m fine dining at 2:00 in the morning with some chicken fingers. As if Iâ€™m going to use a fork and a knife to cut up my chicken fingers. You could throw them across the room and I will catch them in my mouth. Then I have to pretend I have a fake daughter thatâ€™s, you know, in the bath. â€œMy daughterâ€™s getting out of the bath. Can you wrap this up, please? Get the fuck out of here.â€ I said, â€œI could get annoyed during a hotel massage, Dan. Thatâ€™s the kind of bitch I am.â€ The way they talk to you after a 45 minute Swedish massage is ridiculous, â€œYouâ€™re gonna wanna be carefulâ€¦ getting up.â€ Why? Did you amputate my legs? Why do I need to be careful getting up? This is supposed to be more relaxing, not stressful. And then they hand you a gross Dixie cup of room-temperature water. Itâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t want that.â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna wanna drink a lot of water.â€ No, I wonâ€™t. Fuckinâ€™ hate water. The only thing more offensive to me than room-temperature water is room-temperature sparkling water. That is like, â€œFuck you and your family.â€ So I said, â€œSo what do you think I have after all of this?â€ I said, â€œWhat do you think it is, Dan? What? ADD? What?â€ He saidâ€¦ â€œI donâ€™t know if you have ADD.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œI have no idea if you have that. You could take a test for that.â€ Itâ€™s like, great. He said, â€œItâ€™s eight hours long.â€ I was like, â€œLetâ€™s just operate under the assumption that I have it.â€ He said, â€œI think you lack empathy.â€ I was like, â€œLike a Republican?â€ And I had him draw the distinction for me between sympathy and empathy because I couldnâ€™t remember. I said, â€œWait, sympathy is what?â€ â€œSympathy is when you feel sorry for somebody, or you feel badly. Somebodyâ€™s going through a bad time and you help them.â€ I said, â€œIâ€™ve got that.â€ I would do that for any of you sitting here. I would do that for strangers. Yeah, Iâ€™ve got sympathy. He said, â€œEmpathy is actually thinking about what itâ€™s like to be that person thatâ€™s going through a difficult timeâ€¦ Actually thinking about what itâ€™s like to be in their shoes. Have you ever done that?â€ I was like, â€œOh, no.â€ I was like, â€œThatâ€™s depressing. No.â€ He said, â€œYou need to think about the woman thatâ€™s working at the Hudson Booksellers store. You need to think about the fact that she may have more than one job, or that she has to deal with people like you all day long. You have to think about the fact that sheâ€™s got a family at home.â€ And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œI have to think about all those koala bears?â€ But it made sense, and I was clicking. Paying somebody to tell you what is wrong with you is a great transaction. I was like, no friends are gonna tell you, I was like, â€œOkay, great.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHow do I get empathy? Is there an app I can download?â€ And he said, â€œCan you think of any experiences that youâ€™ve had recently where you lacked empathy?â€ I was like, â€œYeah.â€ And all these light bulbs went on in my head, and I remembered going to this movie with one of my gay friends. It was called â€œCall Me By Your Name.â€ It came out three years ago. And I didnâ€™t know what the movie was when we went in, but five minutes in, I did. And I was like, â€œWhat is this?â€ I go, â€œA gay love story?â€ He goes, â€œYeah. Shut up.â€ I go, â€œYouâ€™re so selfish.â€ And Dan looked at me: â€œDo you know why thatâ€™s wrong?â€ I go, â€œI think so. â€˜Cause gay people have had to sit through â€œstraight peopleâ€™s love stories since the beginning of fucking time.â€ And he goes, â€œYeah.â€
So now at my house, all I have on a loop, all day long is gay porn. Out of respect. Finding out I lacked empathy was, like, a huge light bulb, and I was so excited. I was on board with therapy, and he got me from that. Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re right. I donâ€™t have empathy.â€ â€œOkay, letâ€™s go, what else? He said â€œWhat about relationships?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo good. Iâ€™m not good at that.â€ â€œDo you want to be in a relationship?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatever you say, Iâ€™ll do. If you think I should be in one, Iâ€™ll go find somebody.â€ â€œItâ€™s tricky â€™cause everybody annoys me, and men annoy me. Their belts annoy me, their shoes, everything about them.â€ â€œBut if weâ€™re gonna do something, we should lock something down quick.â€ Iâ€™m in a denim onesie right now. I have orthotics in every pair of my shoes. One of my eyes is going bald. I have to shave my face in the shower in the morning to get rid of this facial hair that Iâ€™m starting to grow. I used aftershave the other day for the first time. Either Iâ€™m transitioning and I donâ€™t know itâ€¦ or Iâ€™m in decline. I saw my elbow in the mirror. I was like, is that an iguana? What happened? And why does it look like a butt? The other day I coughed, and liquid came out of my vagina. That, I blame on 50 Cent. And I went to my doctor, and she was, like, doing my hormone testing, and sheâ€™s like, â€œOkay, sweetie, youâ€™re low on testosterone.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m low on testosterone.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI could give a man some testosterone.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m very aggressive.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s not testosterone.â€ So she said â€œYou have none.â€ And she said, â€œItâ€™s just better that you replace your hormones when you start to lose them.â€ And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ So I started taking testosterone, which is some cream you have to rub on your leg like an older woman. I was like, okay, well, here we go. Iâ€™m just heading into elderly territory. Then I go back to the same doctor, two months later and I was like, â€œMy hair is really thin on top. Do you know what that could be from?â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œWell, are you on testosterone?â€ Iâ€™m like â€œYeah, bitch, you prescribed it to me. Donâ€™t you remember? What are you? A vet?â€ â€œWhat are the side effects ofâ€¦ What is testosterone even doing for me?â€ I donâ€™t want to lose my hair. And one of my eyelashesâ€¦ One of my eyes is almost bald. I have two eyelashes that have come in over the past two years. Like, none will sprout. And she says, â€œIt helps with your sex drive.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œSo you want me to be bald and horny?â€ And then what? Whatâ€™s the game plan after that? Just play solitaire all by myself every night?
The thing is, I like older men. When I was 20, that was fine, â€™cause they were 40. When I was 30, I dated a 50-year-old. When I was 35, I dated a 55-year-old. Iâ€™m 45. Iâ€™m not down to fuck a 65-year-old. Okay, that margin needs to close. Iâ€™m all for 65-year-olds, and Iâ€™ll fuck you when I get to be your age. But not now. Itâ€™s too much. There is an age where men either start to look like women, or they get the slippery lips, where their mouths turn into Jacuzzis. And thatâ€™s when I skedaddled.
Which brings me to the strong and deep sexual feelings that I have developed for Andrew Cuomo. I know we all feel it. A lot of women are feeling it. When he came on the scene, he looked like the Incredible Hulk also. That big Italian gorilla. Itâ€™s like, â€œPut on your mask,â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ll put my mask on.â€ Heâ€™s the kind of asshole that I will do shit for. And you know heâ€™s an asshole, and thatâ€™s what I like about him. An old-fashioned asshole whoâ€™s gonna tell me to sit down and shut up. I want him to flatten my curve and then I wanna flatten his curve. And then I want us to apex together. And he can mansplain to me all night long about fishing or motorcycles or whatever dumb shit heâ€™s into that I will pretend that I am into, because thatâ€™s how down I am with him. Guess whoâ€™s not jerking off into plants? Andrew Cuomo. I want him to govern meâ€¦ multiple times. I imagine us spending long weekends together in the Adirondacks, playing games of â€œClue,â€ a game I thought I had already mastered that heâ€™s teaching me entirely new strategies to. I imagine him getting very sick and me having the only medication that can make him better. Two doxycyclineâ€¦ twice a day for ten days. Never on an empty stomach. I would keep him slightly dehydrated so wouldnâ€™t get the slippery lips. Because heâ€™s got them. Heâ€™s on the cusp of exactly what Iâ€™m talking about. That big mouth, and itâ€™s wet, and in two more years, heâ€™s gonna be able to swallow me like a meatball sub. But I need to get in there quick. Once the curve flattens for good, so will my crush. I told Dan that I mostly hook up on vacation when I travel internationally, â€™cause thereâ€™s a language barrier, and that works to my advantage when people canâ€™t really understand what Iâ€™m saying. We went on a scuba diving trip with my girlfriend for her 40th birthday. We all had to get certified and Iâ€™m not really good in a classroom setting. So I wasnâ€™t paying attention, and they were like, everyone needs a buddy. Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t want to be anybodyâ€™s buddy, Iâ€™m not gonna help anybody with their oxygen tank. Like, everyoneâ€™sâ€¦ I canâ€™t, Iâ€™m not the girl for that.â€ And my counsin is, like, â€œIâ€™ll be your buddy.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBut Iâ€™m not gonna save you, so, like, we should split up, and I should go with one of the guides.â€ They had two divemasters. And weâ€™re in French Polynesia, and weâ€™re shark diving. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™m like, I canâ€™t get my mask on normal. Iâ€™m already underwater and shit is, like, messed up all of a sudden. Iâ€™m, like, trying to tie my sneaker underwater. Thatâ€™s the kind of situation I was in. And she pulls on my leg. And I freak out, and I look down, and thereâ€™s this huge blacktip reef shark, and underwater, you canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s five feet away or 20 feet away. So I go to kick it immediately. And I go back, â€™cause I have my scuba tank on, and my goggles fill up with all this water, and I canâ€™t see anything. Iâ€™m sitting there, waiting to be eaten by a shark, and I canâ€™t see. You canâ€™t ascend when you scuba dive â€™cause you could hurt yourself and your equilibrium, you can screw that up. Iâ€™m panicking and having, I think, my very first panic attack. I donâ€™t know what else you could describe it as. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ And all of a sudden, my divemaster comes down, smashes my mask against my face, looks me in the eye, and heâ€™s likeâ€¦ Breathe. And then he holds my hand. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m gonna fuck you. As soon as we get to land, Iâ€™m gonna fuck the shit out of you. This the hottest rescue Iâ€™ve ever had. My God, I love a man in charge of me.â€ We did the rest of our dive holding hands like an underwater couple. Iâ€™ve never been so happy. My friends were all looking at me, giving me the finger underwater. Then we got to the top after our dive, and we got in the little boat, and he took his mask off and I was like, â€œWhoopsie doodle. Youâ€™re gonna wanna put that back on.â€ I was skiing in Switzerland once and I wiped out really badly and I ended up tearing my ACL. And so Iâ€™m, like, tumbling down this mountain. I was skiing out of control, and I paid the price for it. As Iâ€™m crashing, I hearâ€¦ And Iâ€™m like, my God, my legs are gone. Iâ€™ll just be a floating neck when I stop. And I stopped, finally, and I look up at my Austrian ski guide, and heâ€™s smoking a cigarette. Heâ€™s likeâ€¦ â€œYou just tore your ACL. Helicopter is coming.â€ I was like, â€œHelicopter? This is exciting.â€ And a helicopter came in, weâ€™re in the Swiss Alps, and my three girlfriends are just staring at me like, â€œAgain?â€ And they come down, and these two medics run out and they run over to me and Iâ€™m lying on the ground. And theyâ€™re like, â€œAre you okay?â€ And Iâ€™m trying to be tough. Iâ€™m like, â€œYes, Iâ€™m okay.â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œAre you in pain?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNope.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œNo morphine?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m in pain!â€
And then they whisk me away on the stretcher back to the helicopter, and I get in the helicopter. The wind is blowing; The propellers are blowing; Thereâ€™s snow everywhere. It was so romantic. And I get in, and thereâ€™s two pilots and two medics. Iâ€™m like, Iâ€™m gonna fuck all four of these guys. Iâ€™m like, this is gonna be like a reverse gangbang. Look at me! So turned on, so turned on by that rescue. But it was a 45-minute ride to the hospital and they had these thick German accents and Iâ€™m a Jew, so I was like, Iâ€™m not fuckinâ€™ these guys. Not giving these Nazis another victory. Iâ€™ll take one of you, but not all four, not today. When I finished telling Dan that, he was looking at me funny and he said, â€œI really think you need to settle down. â€œYou need to stop. Youâ€™re moving very, very fast.â€ And it seems to me that you could benefit a lot from meditation.â€ And I was likeâ€¦ Meditation, to me, sounded like room-temperature water. And he said, â€œI want you to commit to meditation for three months.â€ And I was like, â€œThree months? Thatâ€™s like a pregnancy.â€ And he was like, â€œThatâ€™s nine months, Chelsea. Pregnancy is nine months, and you know that.â€ I go, â€œDan, some are nine, some are three, some are one. Donâ€™t even get me started.â€ And then cannabis became legal in the state of California. There was all of this education that has been missing for all of these years with cannabis. You no longer had to take a cookie and find out you were on a transcontinental flight 7 hours later. Cannabis became my gateway drug into meditating. It allowed me to, like, slow down. It was cannabis, meditation, therapy. And it was working. I was slowing down. And I was thinking before I spoke, which, before I met Dan, was something that never even occurred to me. And with microdosing, you know, you could take, like, 2 1/2 milligrams, 1 milligram, 5 milligrams, you take a blueberry, youâ€™re never gonna be off your rocker. It sanded down the edges, and I stopped watching the news 24 hours a day and I stopped being so angry at Donald Trump and Ivanka. I was able to focus on other things, I was able to be happier and lighter and I started drinking less, which was a sentence that I thought would never ever come out of my mouth. I was so excited because now cannabis can be a drug that you control, not a drug that controls you. So I was excited about the prospects of cannabis, not only in my life, but all my friendsâ€™ and familyâ€™s lives. All the people Iâ€™ve been prescribing medication to were now getting cannabis instead. Anybody who had trouble sleeping, Iâ€™m like, try this gummy. Anybody who had anxiety, Iâ€™m like, try this edible, try this mint, try this chocolate, covered blueberry. It was helping all sorts of people, and I was doing research and collecting data and I was keeping notes in my medical journal. The best part, I think, about edibles is that you take a little edible, and then sometimes you forget youâ€™ve taken one, and then, like, 45 minutes later, youâ€™re likeâ€¦ Everythingâ€™s a little bit more sparkly. Everybodyâ€™s a little bit less fuckinâ€™ annoying, and youâ€™re like, yeah, I could talk to you for another hour. So my family came out to visit me in LA for Thanksgiving, and my sisterâ€™s a recovering Mormon, and I said, â€œI want you to try this. I know you donâ€™t like fun, but do you wanna try this chocolate-covered blueberry?â€ I said, â€œI think youâ€™re gonna like it.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œYeah, Iâ€™ll try it.â€ And she loved it. She came back into the kitchen an hour later. She goes, â€œSissy, I feel so warm and fuzzy.â€ I go, â€œIsnâ€™t it great?â€ And she goes, â€œMy God, yes. This is better than drinking. This is just-I love everybody.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œI know. Do you want another one?â€ She said, â€œCan I?â€ I go, â€œOh, yeah.â€ And I put in my medical journal, â€œSheâ€™s taking two.â€ An hour later, she walked into the living room from the kitchen with a frozen ham underneath her arm. And Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatâ€™s that about? You wanna cook a ham right now?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œNo, I opened the freezer and this reminded me of Mom.â€ I was like, â€œSissy, letâ€™s go to bed.â€ So we went upstairs, and we got into bed. I took the frozen ham and I threw it in the sauna. I was like, this will be ready at some point. And we got into bed, and we were just, like, snuggling and cuddling like sisters do, and we were laughing and it was so fun. And it was like we were like little girls. And she was like, â€œMy God. This the best feeling.â€ â€œI canâ€™t believe weâ€™re in our 40s and we still get to act like this. How long are we gonna be able to act like this?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œSissy, we will always be able to act like this.â€ Then I stuck my finger in her butt, and she passed right out. So I walked into Danâ€™s office after my family left, and I was like, â€œHey, Dan.â€ I go, â€œCannabis has changed my life. Iâ€™m meditatingâ€. I was meditating every morning for 20 minutes. I was going to the airport. I wasnâ€™t even going to the Fox News lounge. I wasnâ€™t yelling at people who disagreed with me politically. I was trying to have compassion and empathy. And I was being more patient, and I was holding my tongue more. And I said, â€œCannabis is the way to keep families together. Like, this is the best family vacation weâ€™ve ever had. Like, everyone got along. It was fun.â€ And he said, â€œGreat. Iâ€™m in support of that.â€ And he handed me an orange, very casually. He said, â€œI picked this off my tree this morning. I thought you might like an orange.â€ And I was revolted. I was like, â€œOrange?â€
First of all, he knows how I feel about this color since the election. And then I burst into tears, and I was so embarrassed, â€™cause he had not seen me cry and I didnâ€™t want him to see me cry. And I immediately put up the orange in front of my eyes. I was holding it, and then I was stabbing it with my thumb, so the citrus was squirting into my eyes. I was like, â€œShit.â€ And then I was really crying, I was, like, convulsively crying. And there was snot coming out of everywhere. And then at one point, somehow, snot had alley-ooped up to my forehead and then dropped back down to my chin. I looked like Brett Kavanaugh during his senate confirmation hearing. Like a big white male baby! And finally, I dropped it. And I looked at him, and I knew I had no way out. And I said, â€œI need to tell you about the day my brother died and what happened to my family.â€ And I told him about my brother, that there were six of us, and I was the youngest. I was the baby, and my brother Chet was the oldest. He was the only family member who understood that I was born going through menopause, that I was a sweaty baby, and that I would have to retire somewhere probably in the Arctic. He was the only person in my family who knew that when I ate soup, I had to be topless, â€™cause I would immediately start sweating. And when I was a little girl, that was fine. But when I was eight, I remember we had this summer house in Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, and my buds had come in. They werenâ€™t really boobs yet, but they were flappy titties, where your nipple just goes down before itâ€™s gonna burst. And I remember hearing my father say to my brother, â€œYou gotta cover her up if you go into town now. She canâ€™t be topless anymore.â€ â€˜Cause I walked around topless my entire childhood. And I remember hearing that. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatâ€™s he talking about?â€ My brother took me into town to go to this place called the Quarterdeck, where we would always get fast food. It wasnâ€™t fast food, but it was, like, you know, a Vineyard place. You get takeout fried clams, a lobster roll or steamersâ€¦ And I remember that day. I was sitting there, and I was holding my brotherâ€™s hand at the takeout counter, and I was like, â€œIâ€™ll have the clam chowder.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWhoaâ€¦â€ He goes; â€œNo letâ€™s not do soup today.â€ And I said, â€œWhat do you mean? I want clam chowder.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWe canâ€™t have that today. Like, we can take it to go, but we canâ€™t sit out and eat clam chowder. Weâ€™ll explain it to you when we get home.â€ I was like, â€œBut I really want it.â€ And he said, â€œOkay. If you really want it, we can go in my car and you can eat it in the car.â€ And I was like, â€œAll right, whatever.â€ And Iâ€™ll never forget that day. I sat in my brotherâ€™s car eating my clam chowder with my top off, just sweating. And my brother had his back against the passengerâ€™s side window to cover up the little eight-year-old girl that was nude in his car. Just like R. Kelly. And we used to have this game where weâ€™d be, heâ€™d come home from work, and heâ€™d come running up to my parentsâ€™ room, and I was always hiding under the covers in my momâ€™s bed. And heâ€™d come up and go, â€œWhere is she?â€ Itâ€™d be at 11:00 at night. And Iâ€™d hide under the covers and my mom would be like, â€œSheâ€™s not here.â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œShut up, Mom. Youâ€™re not even in this game.â€ And then heâ€™d grab me by the ankles under the covers, throw me over his shoulders and weâ€™d run downstairs and weâ€™d go into the kitchen and Iâ€™d make him a big bowl of Raisin Bran. I knew the right ratio of Raisin Bran to bananas to milk that he liked. And I would make him his dinner and then weâ€™d sit there like a couple and talk about our day. And I remember him telling me he wasnâ€™t coming to Marthaâ€™s Vineyard that year because he was going on a hiking trip in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. And I was mad because I would always drive up with him, and he would leave the window down the whole way so I could have fresh air blowing in my face and be topless. He said, â€œDonâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ll meet you in two weeks on the Vineyard. I will never, ever leave you with these people.â€ And then he went to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and fell off a cliff and died three days later. And Dan said, â€œWhatâ€¦ then what happened?â€ And I said, â€œI just remember going into the kitchen and throwing away all the cereal. Like, cereal was over. It was a wrap on it. Childhood was over. Our family was over. I havenâ€™t had cereal since that day.â€ And he said, â€œWhat happened with your family?â€ And I said, â€œIt was awful.â€ My father was this big, strong man who was in charge of everything and didnâ€™t fuck around. Iâ€™d never seen my father cry. And I remember sitting shivaâ€¦ What Jews do when people die with all these relatives and neighbors and strangers coming to our house, and my dad, who was so strong and so in charge, sitting on the couch like a baby, crying. And I was looking at him, and I was so embarrassed. I was like, â€œWhat are you doing? What is happening, heâ€™s dead, and youâ€™re gonnaâ€¦ what are you doing? Where the fuck are the adults? Iâ€™m nine, what is happening?â€ And I remember, I thought, I gotta grow up. This is it. Itâ€™s over. And at some point, we went back to Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, to our summer house, and my dad was sitting on the deck, and we had a house in front of the water. And he was sitting on the deck, and my parentsâ€™ faces had changed after my brother died. They were just old, all of the sudden. And they were gray, and gray in the face, and I wanted joy back. I didnâ€™t know what was happening. I wanted to bring joy to them again. I wanted them to laugh again. I wantedâ€¦ anything to happen. And I remember I walked outside and I saw my father sitting there, just holding his head. And it was a beautiful sunny day, and I said, â€œDad, can we please just go in the water?â€ I was like, â€œPlease?â€ And he said, â€œNo oneâ€™s going in the water. My boy is dead.â€ And I walked off the deck, and I thought, Iâ€™m gonna go in alone. And the only rule in my family growing up was you could not swim by yourself. You could shoot heroin or hide a body, but you could not swim alone. â€œJawsâ€ was filmed on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard. We were scared of the mechanical shark. But I didnâ€™t care, â€™causeâ€¦ and I was so scared to defy my father. My father wouldâ€¦ he would smack me. I was scared of him, especially in that state. But I didnâ€™t care because my need for joy was paramount to my fear. And I walked off the deck, and I remember walking down to the water, and I just said, keep going. I got in the water, and I swam out, like, 20 yards and I turned around. And he had gone inside. Andâ€¦ Dan said, â€œSit with that feeling.â€ And I said, â€œI canâ€™t. Itâ€™s too painful.â€ He said, â€œSit with it. What do you feel right now?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m so angry.â€ And he said, â€œYes, but whatâ€™s underneath the anger?â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œHurt. Iâ€™m fucking hurt. Iâ€™m hurt that my brother went off and ditched me when he told me he was gonna come back. And then my father ditched me.â€ And he said, â€œYes, whatâ€™s underneath the hurt?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m paying you to tell me whatâ€™s underneath the hurt.â€ He said, â€œRejection. You took that as rejection, because thatâ€™s what a nine-year-old girl thinks. It doesnâ€™t matter that your brother had a hiking accident. It matters that he told you he was coming back and he didnâ€™t come back, so for a nine-year-old little girl, he rejected you. And then your father rejected you, so you were broken up with twice. This is why, when I handed you an orange, you were revolted, because it requires you to be vulnerable with a man, and you donâ€™t trust men, because the two men you trusted the most lied.â€ He said, â€œThis is where your lack of empathy comes in.â€
How are you meant to have empathy for anyone when youâ€™ve never even grieved yourself? Youâ€™ve never allowed yourself to because you had to be strong.â€ And Iâ€™m looking at him, hearing these things, and Iâ€™m likeâ€¦â€ My God, I wanna fuck you, too.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou donâ€™t wanna fuck me.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI do in this moment.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, you want someone to take care of you. Thatâ€™s why you hire guides and why you hook up with guides, â€™cause youâ€™re paying them to take care of you.â€ â€œAnd youâ€™re also paying them, technically, to have sex with you.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œDan, thatâ€™s too far.â€
I didnâ€™t know that my brotherâ€™s death was defining me. I didnâ€™t know that I had the ability to say no to being defined by death. Now I was with a person who could help me process what happened and turn the parts of me that still acted like a nine-year-old little girl into a self-actualized adult who had come to a better understanding of what it means to dig deep and admit that youâ€™re in pain, thereby relinquishing that pain or beginning to relinquish that pain. My brother dying no longer had to define my existence. Itâ€™s part of who I am, perhaps the biggest part, but itâ€™s not all of me. I define me. I decide who I am. No event or person does this. I decide how Iâ€™m going to behave and I know now that vulnerability is not weakness, that vulnerability is strength.
So I was excited. I went home. I was packing my bags. I was leaving for Clearwater, Florida, to visit the Scientologistsâ€¦ to try and knock some sense into them. And I got on my plane, and I was feeling so good. I had the information that I needed to understand why I reactedâ€¦ I wasnâ€™t mad at Donald Trump. Of course I hate Donald Trump, but that was representative of the other time my life became unhinged. It was a trigger, a word I never thought I would use. But it made sense. And I was putting all these pieces together, and I was so grateful. I was sitting on the plane, and I saw this large man walking towards me. And I was like, I hope he doesnâ€™t sit next to me. I could tell by his body type that he was a Trump supporter. He looked like a swollen tick. And he had these denim pants. They werenâ€™t pants, they werenâ€™t denim. They looked denim, but they were cloth. And I was likeâ€¦ that is tricky. I donâ€™t like that, and then I was, no. You donâ€™t judge people based on their denim-looking pants. This person is a man with a family. Stop looking at the exterior and start thinking about the interior of people. Thatâ€™s what Dan taught me. I was like, this is a man with a family. I immediately closed my eyes. Like, this is an opportunity. This is an opportunity to talk to somebody who voted for Donald Trump and actually be kind and generous and understand or try to understand why they would do something like that. So I closed my eyes, and Iâ€™m doing my breathing, Iâ€™m like, okay, opportunityâ€¦ Iâ€™m like, think about his family; Heâ€™s got a wife. Iâ€™m like, well, she probably hates him too. Iâ€™m like, no. Iâ€™m like, no, Chelsea. Wives love husbands usually. I mean, justâ€¦ no, he has children. Heâ€™s someoneâ€™s father. And Iâ€™m like, they fuckinâ€™ hate him too. If they saw him in these shorts, theyâ€™d fuckinâ€™ be pissed too. And I was like, no, no, no. Then I was like, okay, I can do this. I ordered a bowl of cereal for my first time in 30 years. Iâ€™m gonna have a bowl of cereal with a side of Republican. And I took my first bite of cereal, thatâ€™s when I smelled my first fart. There were eight. I know this because I counted, because they were like tsunamis. You thought one was over, and then it was done, a tsunami happens, and the water recedes, and people come down from the trees, and theyâ€™re like, â€œOkay, itâ€™s gone.â€ And then, fuck, another wave is coming. Thatâ€™s what that was like. So the first one, I was like, whoaâ€¦ Is that me? Did I fart? And then there was the second one, Iâ€™m like, heâ€™s farting on me. This Trump supporter is really checking me right now. This is really testing me. And then Iâ€™m thinking, like, my God, he needs a panty shield. Like, he needs something. He definitely needs a doxycycline. So I went in my bag, and I got some out. I took one, I put one on his plate, but I closed my eyes. And I was like, just breathe. You can deal with this too. This is just another challenge. And then I realized I was sucking the air from his asshole into my nose. And I was like, noâ€¦ Remembered the Lamaze from my fake daughter, and I was likeâ€¦ and I kept my eyes shut. I obviously lost my appetite. I didnâ€™t eat anything else. And when the flight attendant came over to clear my tray, I didnâ€™t even look up. I just sat there trying to get myself together. And then finally, he got up to go to the bathroom. And when he did, she came back over, and she said, â€œAre you okay?â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œAre you?â€ And then I turned around to look at the other hostagesâ€¦ I was like, â€œPeople are going to pass away on this flight.â€ She said, â€œHopefully heâ€™s just in the bathroom now getting rid of it.â€ I said, â€œWhat? You canâ€™t say that.â€ I was like, â€œGetting rid of it? You need to call ahead to the airportâ€¦ Do you have a hospital there? Heâ€™s gonna need a colonoscopy. You need to see if thereâ€™s a doctor or a vet on board, okay? He went to Chipotle, and things took a hard left turn.â€ And he comes out of the bathroom, and she scuttles away, and Iâ€™m like, God, Iâ€™m like, okayâ€¦ You have to think of the most loving way to tell someone to stop farting. So he comes walking over, and he sits down and itâ€™s loud andâ€¦ I said, â€œSir, will you please stop what youâ€™re doing?â€ And he said, â€œExcuse me?â€ I go, â€œStop it with your butt.â€ Then I covered my eyes and I sat like this for the rest of the flight, rocking myself like a baby. â€œDonâ€™t say anything else, donâ€™t be a cunt, donâ€™t start a confrontation.â€ Youâ€™ve farted too. Youâ€™ve farted too, okay. Youâ€™ve had bad situations. Remember Panda Express? Donâ€™t judge himâ€¦ And I was so excited. We were descending. I was like, you did it, you didnâ€™t do anything. If that had just been six months ago-six months before I had gone to therapy, just six monthsâ€¦ He would have gone to the bathroom. I wouldâ€™ve formed a gang. I would be the leader of the gang. I wouldâ€™ve lurched at him like this, grabbed him by the neck, pinned him down on the floor, â€™cause I have strength like that, and flipped him over like a baby and stapled his asshole shut. But I didnâ€™t do that because Iâ€™m growing. And theyâ€™re called baby steps. So as we were leaving the plane, the plane had landed, he gathered his stuff, I didnâ€™t make eye contact. We never had the relationship I thought we could have because he ruined it with his asshole. And the flight attendant came over as I was leaving, and sheâ€™s like, â€œIt was a pleasure having you on board.â€ I was like, â€œYeah, thank you.â€ I was like, â€œThe pleasure was all yours.â€ And she said, â€œCan I ask you something?â€ And I was like, â€œYeah, of course.â€ And she said, â€œI heard a funny story about you once.â€ I was like, â€œReally?â€ I go, â€œWhich one?â€ â€œI heard you were so high once you tried to get off a plane mid-flight.â€ I said, â€œIâ€™ve heard that story too.â€ I said, â€œThat was Elizabeth Banks.â€
Thank you, guys! Does anybody want some complementary oranges? There you go. Thank you, New Jersey. Itâ€™s good to be home. Yeah! Thank you, guys! I love you guys. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen! Give it up for Tom Papa!
Thank you very much. Look at you. Look at you, still alive. Good job. Iâ€™m proud of you. Oh, thank you so much for that. This is so nice to be here. Weâ€™re gonna have a good time, I hope. They say these are very exciting times. They are. Some people say scary times. I disagree. I think these are very exciting times. When theyâ€™re changing all the rules, we can do anything we want now. I say, letâ€™s kidnap some billionaires. Why not? We got a lot of problems. Five guys have all the money. Letâ€™s go get them. Whoâ€™s gonna stop us? Iâ€™m all for you being a billionaire. Good job. You worked hard, you changed the world. You get to be a billionaire for 24 hours. You donâ€™t start giving that money away to poor people by morning, weâ€™re coming to get you. Could you imagine a billion dollars? I donâ€™t even dream like that, do you? One person, a billion dollars.
No, I used to be bothered by big dreams and high expectations. Not anymore. This is it, guys. This is it. Weâ€™re already doing it. You did it. Good job. This is it. Really. For me, a good day is any day I donâ€™t have to retrieve a username and password. Oh. Oh. What a great day. Nothing worse on the planet, when youâ€™re about to have some fun and youâ€™re cock-blocked by the username and password. Thereâ€™s nothing worse. I mean, I know thereâ€™s wars going on, and things are on fire, but for us, for usâ€¦ thereâ€™s nothing worse. Itâ€™s not like in the olden times and fairy tales and storybooks, when you need a magical password, go on an adventure, you get something amazing for it. You need the password to get in the gate, go into the dark forest, and become friends with a talking crow, fight a demon with a willow stick, and you get the password. And the doors open up, and a unicorn gives you a ride to a magical wizard who gives you gold coins and sexual favors. We donâ€™t get any of that after pouring our heart and souls into our devices for three straight hours, giving away all our family secrets, our momâ€™s maiden name, and who she had sex with in high schoolâ€¦ and then we play that â€œsquareyâ€ game like weâ€™re in nursery school. Is there a stoplight in the square? Is there a dump truck in the square? Was that my dead grandma in the square? They send a bunch of codes to other emails you donâ€™t have the password for, either. Then finally you get the password. Do we get sexual favors from wizards? No. What do we get? What do we get? We get to order on the Pizza Hut app. Yay. Yay. If only I had the courage to call someone on the phone three hours agoâ€¦ and place this order. But Iâ€™m scared of people now. I donâ€™t know what that 16-year-old manager at Pizza Hut is gonna ask me, but itâ€™s gonna be scary. No way around it.
Weâ€™re all being changed, dragged into the metaverse, turned into robots as we speak. Remember you before these devices as a different person? You get a glimpse of it when you go out into the world without your phone. You ever do that, leave your phone behind? By mistake, of course. You wouldnâ€™t do it intentionally. But just go out about the day without your phone? Oh! What a great day. Once you get past the crying and the dry heaving andâ€¦ tugging on strangersâ€™ pant legs, asking for help. Once you get through all of that, itâ€™s a magical day. You just walk around with your own thoughts, just thinking about stuff. Wow, this must be what Benjamin Franklin felt likeâ€¦ just walking around, thinking about kites and candies and syphilis.
Thereâ€™s no getting around it. The world is too easy with it. Could you imagine traveling without your phone? Leaving tomorrow, going to the airport, getting on a plane and leaving for three days without your phone? Terrifying idea. How did you even get to the airport? Thatâ€™s a good question. How did you get to the airport? Is Uber responding to smoke signals now? What happens once youâ€™re at the airport and they change your flight or gate? How are you gonna know? Youâ€™re not. Youâ€™re not gonna know. Youâ€™re just gonna wander the halls of the airport until you die. Youâ€™re going to die at the airport on the floor outside of a Hudson Newsâ€¦ thatâ€™s filled with things that could save you if only you had Apple Pay. Thatâ€™d be a good ending to the story. Or would it? What happens if you die, and you go up to Heaven, and theyâ€™re like, â€œWe werenâ€™t gonna let you in, but you did your best.â€ â€œYou get in. Welcome to Heaven. Congratulations.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s your username and password?â€ I donâ€™t have it, I donâ€™t have it.
Remember two years ago, when they told us we couldnâ€™t see our families? Remember that? Yeah. Donâ€™t do it. Donâ€™t go home. Youâ€™re gonna kill your family with your face. No. No holidays for you, not this year. You stay home. Youâ€™re gonna kill your mom with your breath. Two years, no family. Oh, my God. Those were the good old days. We all had the same excuse, we all had the same excuse. I would love to come home, but they wonâ€™t let me. Iâ€™m gonna have to spend Thanksgiving with my friends and have fun this year.
Oh, man. Families are a blessing. It is a blessing if you have your family, but it doesnâ€™t make â€™em any less annoying. I just saw my parents. Oh, my God. Theyâ€™re getting goofy. My father bought my mother one of those weapons-grade jackhammer massage guns. Have you seen these things? These new torture devices theyâ€™re just selling to old people to try on each other? No background check, no licensing, no training of any kind. My father just aimed it at my motherâ€™s shoulder and hit the trigger. Wasnâ€™t good. Wasnâ€™t good. It just gathered up her skin like pancake batter. She couldnâ€™t get away. He couldnâ€™t turn it off. She looked like a Shar Pei stuck in a car wash. Yeah, it got the knot out. It also got her collarbone out and her shoulder blade. And all her insides are on the outside now.
I love them to death. I do. But what are we doing with our old people? We should be protecting our old people. Why are we telling our old people they can do more things the older they get? Thatâ€™s not how it works. You donâ€™t add things to your bucket list after 70. Anything you donâ€™t do by 70, you donâ€™t have to do. My mother watches TV, she gets these ideas, seeing all these active old people, she comes back, â€œYour father and I are gonna start to travel.â€ â€œYour dad and I are gonna hit the road.â€ â€œTime to start traveling.â€ No. Youâ€™re scared of stairs. This isnâ€™t the time to backpack through Europe. Your ankles are made of Popsicle sticks. It takes Dad three tries to get up the ramp at Starbucks, just gaining momentum till he eventually bursts through the door and forgets where he is. Starts cursing out the barista because his carâ€™s not ready.
â€œYou donâ€™t know. Your father and I like activities.â€ â€œWe rent the tandem bike.â€ â€œWe go to the hotel. We rent a tandem bike.â€ Donâ€™t. A tandem bike after 70 should be called a double suicide. Two people who donâ€™t get along and donâ€™t know where theyâ€™re going, turning in opposite directions, should not be on a tandem bike. You should be in a wagon. You should be in a wagon, and weâ€™ll tug you around, you can feed the ducks. Weâ€™ll have you home by 4:00, in time for your programs.
And then they get angry. They get angry if I try and help them, and give them advice, and protect them, they get all defensive. â€œDonâ€™t tell us what to do. Weâ€™re your parents. We made you.â€ All right. Thank you for inventing me. That was very nice. But things have changed. Things have changed. My brainâ€™s still intact. I didnâ€™t put sponges in the toaster this morning.
Iâ€™m looking forward to the time when my kids help me out. I have two teenage daughters. They help me out now. Iâ€™m grateful for the assistance. I donâ€™t do things right a lot. They donâ€™t have to know itâ€™s because Iâ€™m drunk and high. But I am confused sometimes. â€œDad, should the stove still be on?â€ â€œNo.â€ â€œNo, I made dinner an hour ago.â€ â€œThat potâ€™s going to have to soak for a while.â€ â€œFill it with bubbles. Weâ€™ll deal with it on Wednesday.â€ â€œDad, that was a stop sign.â€ â€œGood thing weâ€™re speeding.â€ â€œHold my weed. Iâ€™m gonna make a U-turn.â€ â€œDonâ€™t tell your mom.â€
They could be nicer about it, though. Nothing meaner than a teenage girl when she comes after you. Nothing meaner on the planet, â€™cause theyâ€™re smart, theyâ€™re cunning, and they just laser on your weaknesses. Itâ€™s very unsettling. My daughter came into the kitchen she said, â€œDad, weâ€™re trying to watch a movie in the other room, and we can hear you breathing.â€ â€œOkay, Iâ€™ll just stop that.â€ â€œIâ€™ll just stop breathing and living here, and living all together. How about that?â€ And she just high-fived her sister and went back to watching The Avengers.
My other daughter, 16, was just staring me down at breakfast. Very scary. She hasnâ€™t made eye contact with me since she was six. â€œI donâ€™t like the way you chew your granola.â€ â€œWhy you chewing your granola like that?â€ What the hell does that even mean? Itâ€™s granola. Itâ€™s big and itâ€™s crunchy. I have to make it smaller. Or itâ€™s gonna rip apart my trachea. How do you eat your granola? You just swallow it whole, like a snake? Devil child?
This is the same daughter, by the way, who without my permission or my knowledge, during the Troubles, went out and adopted a rescue pug. A pug! Did all the paperwork herself and just showed up with a pug. If you donâ€™t know what a pug is, they advertise it as a dog. It is not. It has a fat, round, hairy, turkey-like body, four spindly legs that look like it couldnâ€™t support that fat body. Dogs have paws. Pugs have long, lady fingers with fancy press on nails. Some have four, some have three, some two. Like a chicken foot. And the face of an arthritic 80-year-old man. Eyes that look like it belongs on a different animal altogether. It looks like God was making it, ran out of pug eyes and said, â€œLetâ€™s give it cow eyes. See how that goes.â€ It doesnâ€™t go. This poor guyâ€™s got these two bulbous things hanging out of his skull. The lids canâ€™t even get up and over the ball. He hasnâ€™t had his eyes shut in the time Iâ€™ve had him. He just struggles and snores 24 hours a day. â€œIs he asleep right now? Weâ€™re on a walk.â€
Fun fact. Fun fact. If a pug falls in the pool, it sinks immediately. Turns out if your headâ€™s made of a concrete block, youâ€™re gonna face plant in the deep end. Still snoring, still snoring. Bubbles coming up on either side. I donâ€™t think he even knows heâ€™s in the pool. Think he thinks he wandered into a weird part of the yard and his glaucomaâ€™s flaring up.
Best part about him, his name is Frank. Which is hilarious, because any time you yell at him, itâ€™s like youâ€™re in a movie with Sinatra. â€œCome on, Frank. Why are you acting that way?â€ â€œYouâ€™ve changed, Frank. Youâ€™ve changed.â€
Like I said, heâ€™s a purebredâ€¦ A purebred rescue dog. He was found on the mean streets of Downey, California. If you donâ€™t know where Downey is, itâ€™s like here, but a little more stabby. Why was Frank just wandering the mean streets of Downey, California? Thereâ€™s either something wrong with him, or heâ€™s wanted by the law. Thereâ€™s something wrong with Frank. Something very wrong with Frank. Frank pees everywhere he goes, inside or out, wherever the hell he wants, Frank pees. I found this out because I got a blacklight on Amazon. Yes. Well, I never caught him in the act. Iâ€™d always see him walking down the hall with his fancy lady feet and a suspicious look in his fat eye. I never caught him, but I got that blacklight, and I went through my house. He has devastated my home. Ruined it. My office in particular, wrecked it. First I didnâ€™t say anything. I was like, â€œWhat if itâ€™s me?â€ After careful analysis, itâ€™s Frank. Itâ€™s very low. So what do you do? I got angry at first. â€œHow do I handle this?â€ Maybe leave the back door open and see if he wants to go for a swim? Then I checked myself. â€œNo, letâ€™s get him checked out.â€ Maybe thereâ€™s something really wrong with Frank, like a bladder problem. I donâ€™t know what goes on inside pugs other than prizes. Maybe there is a urinary tract infection. I took him in, heâ€™s a healthy son of a pug. Everything checks out. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with his urinary tract. No infections. Whatâ€™s wrong, according to the vet, in medical terms, is Frank is an asshole. He knows what heâ€™s doing, and heâ€™s gonna continue doing it while heâ€™s looking me right in the face. So I went back to Amazon, where all our answers lie, and they make diapers for pugs. They make diapers for pugs. You can get â€™em on Amazon. I know itâ€™s pathetic. It doesnâ€™t even look like a diaper. Looks like those Velcro back braces the UPS guy wears his last year on the job. Just kind of hanging off his ass. Doesnâ€™t look like it does much, but his sciatica is really bothering him. We donâ€™t call them diapers out of respect for Sinatra. We call them pants. â€œCome on, Frank. We got company over. Put on some pants, will you?â€ â€œFor crying out loud.â€
Iâ€™ll admit it felt weird putting pants on a dog. Didnâ€™t feel right, didnâ€™t feel natural. But then I thought about what dogs have done in our short years. When I was a child, a dog was a dog. It lived outside in the yard, tied to a tree. If you went somewhere, the dog waited for your return. It could be an hour, a day, a year. The dog waited for you to come home. Youâ€™d never say to your father, â€œCan we bring the dog on vacation?â€ They would have tied you to the other tree. And look what theyâ€™ve accomplished now, these dogs, I see them everywhere. I see them checking into hotels by themselves. I see them in fancy restaurants, drinking martinis, boarding flights to Hawaii. Well, I donâ€™t know how you did it, dogs, but you did it. Youâ€™re part of the human world. You did it. Congratulations. Now that youâ€™re here, take your tongue out of your ass and take a look around. And youâ€™ll notice weâ€™re all wearing pants, â€™cause we know what our junk looks like and it should be covered up.
I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever seen a pugâ€™s penis, sir. You look like youâ€™ve seen some shit in your day. Maybe you did some time. I donâ€™t know how you live. If you havenâ€™t seen it, Google it after the show. All of you, Google it after the show. Private browser, private browser. Wait till you see it. Itâ€™s weird, itâ€™s misshapen, itâ€™s covered in weird, multicolored horse hairs. It follows you around the room when you walk by. It looks like something the devil would tickle you with. Put on some pants.
But, as disgusting as pugs are, and they are, weâ€™re worse. Human beings are worse. I thought we were gonna be better after all we went through. I thought weâ€™d be more germ conscious, a little more mannerly. Nope! Just as disgusting as before. We are. Weâ€™re horrible. Coughingâ€™s back. Coughingâ€™s back. Walking through the airport, all these people acting like sea lions. No one covers their mouths. Spraying whole rows of people. I saw a guy on the plane clipping his nails. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Why? Why is a nail clipper in your pocket in the first place? Whatâ€™s in your other pocket? Used dental floss and toilet paper? Whatâ€™s wrong with you? Theyâ€™re back to spitting everywhere, those big man-spits right on the sidewalk where youâ€™re walking. Those big, disgusting, from the small intestine, windup spits. It was six inches from going out the other way. And this guy says, â€œNo, Iâ€™m bringing it up top.â€ â€œPeople are gonna wanna see this.â€ And it just lands on the sidewalk like an alien afterbirth. Itâ€™s got eyes and a heartbeat and feelings. Skitters into the sewer and replicates itself. And thatâ€™s where COVID came from. Iâ€™m not really kidding. Thatâ€™s where it came from.
All these examples are things that men do. Men do these things. I never saw a woman blow her nose in the air without a tissue in all my days. These are things that men do. And I know weâ€™re trying to figure it out. Was it a bat? Was it a kangaroo? Was it a lab? I donâ€™t know. I know one thingâ€™s for sure. Men were involved. You know. You know, you know some guy dared another guy to do something weird to a bat for $10. And they went out to an alley next to a lab, and a bunch of other guys got in a circle and cheered him on. And now weâ€™re gonna be wearing masks to the end of time.
We canâ€™t help it. Men. Weâ€™re horrible. Men are horrible. Weâ€™re horrible. Weâ€™re disgusting. Every guy in here pees in his own yard. Pees in hisâ€¦ Right? Yes, yes, yes. â€œNo, Tom, not my guy.â€ Yeah, your guy. I guarantee it, when youâ€™re not looking, behind the lounge chair, behind the grill. In the grill, if itâ€™s on. Yeah, because thatâ€™s a fun noise. Think about it, any inconvenience you have out in the world is because men were there before, did something horrible and they had to change the rules. Why canâ€™t you just walk into a bathroom at a gas station? Why do they have to give a key attached to a chain attached to a truck tire? And we have to drag it around the building like an Egyptian slave. Why? Because men were in there. Horrible men doing horrible things. Playing in the toilet like a bird bath. Putting their penis in the hand dryer. Yes. You think when the Dyson came out, thatâ€™s not what they were doing? Thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re doing. I know, the ladyâ€™s room is no treat either. Thatâ€™s not because of anything you do in there. Thatâ€™s â€™cause men sneak in there when youâ€™re not looking and use your hand dryer too. But, as disgusting as we are, and no man will dispute that fact, weâ€™re good for you. Men are good for you. We make you stronger. Yes, weâ€™re immunity boosters. You think this whole thing was bad? It wouldâ€™ve been twice as bad if men werenâ€™t fiddling their nuts and grabbing every door handle in town. So youâ€™re welcome. The other thing that men have, and I donâ€™t understand why women donâ€™t have it, this seems backwards to me, is this incredible amount of self-esteem and self-confidence built on absolutely nothing. As awful as we are, every guy also thinks everyone wants him all the time. A guy will pee in his backyard, walk out the front door and think, â€œShe wants me.â€ And yet women are the most magical, beautiful creatures on this planet, just gliding around the globe like cotton candy goddesses, just filled with life and love and beauty and self-doubt. â€œDo I look fat? Do I look old? I hate my hair. I hate my eyes. I hate my ass.â€ And meanwhile, youâ€™re walking around with a pet orangutan. Who doesnâ€™t even look in the mirror.
The epitome of male vanity is in the summer. In the summer, in any town, you will see a man, an 80-year-old man, walking down the street in a tank top, or worse, no shirt at all. Just strutting down the sidewalk like an expired rotisserie chicken. No muscle mass left, just two bony chicken wings. Licorice nipples swaying in the wind. Gold chains tangled in his spooky cobweb body hair. With the nerve to hit on young women. God, I donâ€™t know how you women let us climb all over you. I really donâ€™t. I would be a lesbian for sure. Both of my daughters are straight. Iâ€™m like, â€œFocus, we have time.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t have to do this.â€ I am not a lesbian.
I am a straight, married man. Iâ€™ve been married now to the same woman for 22 years. Thank you. You donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going through. No, sheâ€™s great, of course. 22 years. Sheâ€™s the best. I love her to death. Iâ€™m not gonna be up here attacking marriage. I believe in marriage, really do. Itâ€™s a hard life to get through. If you find someone else, partner up through it all, itâ€™s good. It can make your life a lot better. If you find the right person, and lower your expectations of what youâ€™re gonna get out of it, youâ€™ll be very happily married. I donâ€™t mean to demean it when I say lower your expectations. I think thatâ€™s why people get divorced. Too high of an expectation of what theyâ€™re gonna get out of this one relationship. Itâ€™s not that much. Donâ€™t put so much pressure on it. Keep your eyes open going into it. Donâ€™t be dumb about it. Gotta be smart. I have a friend thatâ€™s thinking about getting married. Heâ€™s so dumb. The way heâ€™s talking, heâ€™s a moron. Heâ€™s been with the girl for five years, the things he talks about, â€œSheâ€™s nice, you know, her familyâ€™s pretty cool.â€ â€œSheâ€™s smart, but I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™s hot enough.â€ â€œDonâ€™t know, weâ€™re talking about getting married. She hot enough?â€ Are you high? Hot enough?! Youâ€™re talking about getting married for the rest of your life. You donâ€™t care about hot, you donâ€™t marry hot. You marry strong. You donâ€™t want a supermodel. You want someone who can pick up the other end of the couch. Without taking the cigarette out of her mouth. Thatâ€™s who you marry.
No. Itâ€™s a good thing. If youâ€™re married, and in here tonight, itâ€™s a great night for you. Youâ€™re having a great time. Thereâ€™s no pressure on you at all. Youâ€™re married. You donâ€™t even care if your partnerâ€™s having fun right now. Thatâ€™s not why youâ€™re here. Letâ€™s let someone else talk for an hour. Itâ€™s easy. If youâ€™re dating, if youâ€™re in here right now on a date, this is a difficult night for you. This is a lot of work. You actually care how this goes tonight. You want them to be happy. Itâ€™s a lot of pressure. This is whyâ€¦ this is the thing that bothers me about dating. If you do get in a fight on the way home tonight, maybe off of something Iâ€™m about to say, if you get in a fight tonight, the whole relationship could be over tonight. Tonight. You could end it tonight. Because you have that option. And thatâ€™s a horrible option to have. Because if you do leave, oh my God, you gotta get your laptop, and all your chargers. Get a new haircut, buy some cool clothes, go back out into the world. Lie to everybody all over again about how great you are. My wife and I could get in the same exact fight tonight, and weâ€™re not breaking up. We are not leaving, because we donâ€™t have that option. We could get in the worst fight in the world, we are not leaving. Iâ€™m not leaving. I get in a fight, I donâ€™t leave. I go to the pantry. I go to the pantry and I get a sleeve of Girl Scout cookies. And I eat them one by one as Iâ€™m staring at my reflection in the toaster oven. Until I feel so disgusting that I forgive her, for whatever it is she said, because I know sheâ€™s probably right because sheâ€™s married to a monster person who just ate 24 Samoas standing up. I donâ€™t need cool clothes, I donâ€™t have to get a new haircut. Get a haircut when she says, â€œget a haircut.â€ And I get clothes when she gets clothesâ€¦ reminds me I need clothes. Thatâ€™s how married couples end up looking alike. â€œBe right back, going to get sneakers.â€ â€œWait a minute.â€ â€œI need sneakers, too.â€ â€œYou do? You wanna come?â€ â€œYeah, I wanna come.â€ â€œLetâ€™s go. Sneaker day!â€ And we go to Footlocker and we sit in the married section. And they bring out sneakers that arenâ€™t made for any athletic event whatsoever. No, theyâ€™re big and theyâ€™re white and they got Velcro. Theyâ€™re good for standing while we wait for each other. â€œYou want socks, too?â€ â€œYou read my mind.â€ â€œSocks, shorts, and sneakers. Donâ€™t bag â€™em up. Weâ€™re gonna wear â€™em out.â€ Do we look good? No. We donâ€™t look good. That wasnâ€™t the point. The point was to make each other unfuckable to the rest of the world. We donâ€™t need some single pervert looking at your cool shoes and making a move on you. Thatâ€™ll ruin the good thing we got going.
â€œWhat about the sex, Tom? What about the sex?â€ Everyone asks, â€œOne person for the rest of your life?â€ â€œWhat about the sex?â€ Grow up. Dumbass sex. You mean the cause of every dumb decision youâ€™ve made? That sex? Sex is fun, but itâ€™s a ride. Itâ€™s a ride. The first time I went on Space Mountain, sure, it was exciting. I didnâ€™t know it was gonna do that. Whee! Hey! Iâ€™ve been riding Space Mountain now for 22 years. I know how it goes. Itâ€™s fun, but you end up confused, nauseous, and in need of a nap.
I was staying in New York recently, and the people in the hotel room next to me were having sex. Very loud, very rhythmic, very joyful. And it kept going, 15, 20 minutes. I was like, â€œI guess the pandemicâ€™s over.â€ Have fun in there. Didnâ€™t stop. Kept going. Twenty-five, 30 minutes. Nonstop. No break. Thirty straight minutes. I called my wife, I was like, â€œI owe you an apology.â€ Didnâ€™t stop there. 35, 40 minutes. 40 minutes nonstop action. Weâ€™ve never hit 40 minutesâ€¦ 40 minutes straight? No, you could add in dinner. We havenâ€™t hit 40 minutes. I wouldnâ€™t want to. 40 minutes? Get off me. I got stuff to do. Whereâ€™s my phone? At an hour, I just put in earplugs and cried myself to sleep. I donâ€™t wanna know these people even exist out there. Woke up the next morning, 7:00 in the morning, still heard it, Still heard it, 7:00 in the morning! I go, wait a minute. This isnâ€™t people. This is porn. This is porn. I was so relieved. But then I got angry, whoâ€™s in there at the ass-end of a pandemic, spraying all over like Frank? A man. A disgusting man. Awful.
Look, Iâ€™m not gonna judge you, or where youâ€™re at in your relationship. Single or married? I donâ€™t know. These are things are complicated, theyâ€™re difficult to navigate. Itâ€™s tricky, you hook up with somebody you donâ€™t know, youâ€™re gonna go the distance? Thatâ€™s gonna change. Youâ€™re gonna change. Youâ€™ll both get weird hobbies, start doing weird things. Youâ€™re gonna look weird. Itâ€™s gonna change. Youâ€™re gonna find out things about your spouse you didnâ€™t see coming. I just found out my wife doesnâ€™t like when I read. She doesnâ€™t like when I read! Anything! A book, a magazine, a cereal box. If my wife sees me reading, she doesnâ€™t think, â€œHe needs some quiet time.â€ No, she thinks, â€œHeâ€™s bored. Let me tell him a story about my sister at work.â€ â€œHeâ€™s reading a book. He must be really bored.â€ â€œLet me tell him about my momâ€™s new lease agreement on her apartment.â€ Ugh.
The other time she likes to talk is late at night. Late at night when I get into bed, put my head on the pillow, and turn out the lights. Thatâ€™s when she likes to talk about cancer, child abductions, and the end of days. Whatever bad news she gathered up during the day, sheâ€™s gonna sprinkle on my side of the bed. Until she unloads and starts to snore. As soon as she turns out the light, â€œI spoke to your mom on the phone today.â€ â€œShe sounded so old. I wonder how much more time we have with her.â€ â€œHave you pet the cat recently? Heâ€™s got a tumor on his neck.â€ â€œCarolâ€™s cat grew a tumor. Itâ€™s so big, it looks like heâ€™s wearing a hat.â€ â€œDid I mention I spoke to your mom on the phone today?â€ â€œWhoâ€™s older, your mother or your father?â€ â€œOne of â€™emâ€™s not making it to Christmas, I can feel it.â€ â€œI canâ€™t believe our daughters are going away to college soon.â€ â€œItâ€™s terrible to think theyâ€™ll be out in the world with all those horrible men.â€ â€œProbably no more horrible than what theyâ€™re doing in their rooms on their phones right now, though.â€ â€œCarolâ€™s daughters have been taking pictures of their vaginas, putting â€™em on the internet.â€ â€œDo you think thatâ€™s what our daughters are doing right now?â€ â€œTwenty feet from our bed, on our family plan?â€ â€œI spoke to your mom. I spoke to your mom on theâ€¦â€
And I stare at the ceiling for six straight hours just waiting for the sun to come up so I can get some coffee, and get away from this devil woman I sleep with. Shouldnâ€™t be sleeping in the same bed anymore. Not all the time. Once in a while itâ€™s fun. But, you know look, I hope you find love in life. I really do. I hope youâ€™re as lucky as I have been. It doesnâ€™t mean a life sentence of having to be in the same bed with your partner for the rest of your life. Oh my God. Look, I tell her, â€œLook, someoneâ€™s leaving tonight.â€ â€œSomeoneâ€™s getting the pillow, kicking the other one and leaving in the middle of the night in a rage.â€ Why not do that at 10:00, with a peck on the cheek? â€œLove you. Mwah. See you in the morning. Mwahâ€
She wonâ€™t do it. Sheâ€™s hanging on to the young version of us. And of course, starting out, you should be in the same bed. You have to be! Youâ€™re young, sexual, youâ€™re in love. Make love three times a night. You end up asleep in a pretzel twist, foot in your face, hanging upside down. And you do sleep well that way. Thatâ€™s the thing. You actually sleep a solid eight hours that way. And you wake up in the morning so refreshed and in love. You look at each other, â€œLetâ€™s do it again.â€ â€œLetâ€™s have morning sex,â€ you say. We donâ€™t say that where I live. No, weâ€™re too busy in the morning pointing at each other and blaming each other for who ruined the sleep last night. â€œIt was you. Thereâ€™s something wrong with you.â€ â€œOh, no. You need a doctor.â€ â€œThereâ€™s something inside of you and itâ€™s trying to get out.â€ And the reality is itâ€™s probably both of us because weâ€™re over 40. And if youâ€™re over 40, you have a 50% chance of getting a good nightâ€™s sleep tonight. Fifty percent. Just you, alone. Fifty percent chance youâ€™ll get a good nightâ€™s sleep. â€˜Cause youâ€™re dying. Youâ€™re slowly dying. Your bodyâ€™s trying to choke you out and technologyâ€™s keeping you alive. Fifty percent chance youâ€™ll get a good nightâ€™s sleep. And not â€™cause you did something crazy, not â€™cause you went on a cocaine bender. No, someone had a cookie after 6:00. â€œDonna had cheese at the party. Oh, no!â€ â€œSheâ€™s not going to breathe right for a week.â€ â€œBob had three beers. Three beers. Welcome to the Fart Palace.â€ â€œBuckle up. No oneâ€™s sleeping tonight.â€
My wife has a lot going on. She grinds her teeth in her sleep. Sheâ€™s so angry sheâ€™s grinding her own teeth down to nubs. Rather than find out the cause of that, they donâ€™t do that. Instead they just give her an NFL issued mouthpiece and just shove that in her mouth like a chew toy from Petco. She goes through three or four a month like an angry beaver. I wake up with bits of plastic all over my face. And itâ€™s blue and it glows in the dark. Yeah, thatâ€™s how I know if weâ€™re fooling around at night. If I see a blue floaty thing coming across the roomâ€¦ Not happening. Not tonight. She just put on her equipment. Put on her headgear and her mouthguard and her eucalyptus ointments, climbs into bed with her unshaved legs like a koala bear. Like an angry koala bear trying out for the Packers. And she gets up to pee like six, seven times a night. I didnâ€™t know a woman could have a swollen prostate, but she does. And when she walks, her ankle pops. You can hear it! Pop, pop, pop, pop. You donâ€™t hear it during the day when thereâ€™s leaf blowers and garbage trucks. You donâ€™t hear it at all. Three oâ€™clock in the morning, loudest sound youâ€™ll ever hear. Pop, pop, pop, pop. Trying to breathe through the mouthpieceâ€¦ Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Itâ€™s like Darth Vaderâ€™s trapped in bubble wrap in my bedroom. And thatâ€™s why you should get married, too.
Itâ€™s weird being a human being, isnâ€™t it? This is weird, what youâ€™re going through. I know, â€™cause Iâ€™m one, too. Itâ€™s weird. The reason weâ€™re here, to connect with people. Itâ€™s our whole thing, connect with people. Befriend people, date people, marry people, make new people. But everybody that you fall in love with, connect with, you have more to worry about. Every love is a worry. Itâ€™s a weird way to live. Thatâ€™s why everyoneâ€™s on drugs. First time I took my daughter into a doctorâ€™s appointment when she was a baby, Her first doctorâ€™s appointment I realized, â€œIâ€™m never gonna sleep again.â€ I never loved something so much and felt so vulnerable at the same time. Itâ€™s a weird way to live. Everything was cool, but terrifying. Doctorâ€™s like, â€œEverythingâ€™s great, everythingâ€™s good.â€ â€œOkay, good.â€ â€œOne thing.â€ â€œOh, shit. What is it?â€ Start sweating immediately. â€œNot a big deal, but her head is in the fifth percentile.â€ â€œWhat does that mean?â€ â€œIt means that 95% of the heads out there are bigger than her head.â€ â€œWhat?â€ â€œYes. Only 5% of the population have a head as small as your daughter.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t see them, â€™cause theyâ€™re scurrying in the dark from alleyway to alleyway.â€ â€œWhat?â€ â€œNot a big deal. Weâ€™ll just check every six months.â€ â€œOkay.â€ I got her home, I took her to the playroom, started blowing in her mouth. â€œCome on, grow.â€ Panicked for two years. Thereâ€™s nothing to worry. Everyoneâ€™s head grows. You never walk through the mall, see someone with a ping pong head walking down the hall, with a bottle cap for a hat. â€œHello.â€ No, everyoneâ€™s head is fine.
But you shouldnâ€™t stop loving because of the fear. You canâ€™t. The more love, the less you actually are frightened. You keep doing it. All the closest people in your life, you donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re up to. Everyoneâ€™s got their own secrets, lives. Youâ€™re not responsible for them. Even the people you make! Even your children! My daughter came home from college, first year of college, I was like, â€œYouâ€™re an adult now. Welcome home.â€ â€œWould you like some wine with dinner? Youâ€™re a grown-up now. Welcome.â€ â€œHow about some wine?â€ â€œNo, thanks, Dad. I donâ€™t drink.â€ â€œOh.â€ â€œI donâ€™t like alcohol.â€ â€œOh. What a good dad I am.â€ She said, â€œI only smoke weed.â€ â€œOh? How long you been doing that?â€ â€œSince I was a freshman in high school,â€ she said! â€œOh?â€ â€œWhere?â€ â€œIn my room,â€ she said. Four years, straight A student. High as a kite, in my house. She loved the weed. Hereâ€™s the problem. I love the weed more. And for four years I didnâ€™t smoke it because I wanted to be a good example for the children. For four years, I ate nothing but handfuls of melatonin gummies to get some kind of buzz and eventually fall asleep. She was doing bong hits right down the hall.
My real goal, what Iâ€™ve learned having these kids is make good people. Thereâ€™s a lot of bad people, thereâ€™s a lot of good people. We canâ€™t change the bad people, apparently, but maybe we could outnumber them by making more good people. Should be easy. Itâ€™s not like bad people are making great kids. No, they make shitty kids. You see them out there, knocking things over in restaurants, falling down wells. I donâ€™t know why we even scoop â€™em out. Whoâ€™s falling down a well? Not a good kid. Theyâ€™re gonna fall again. Seems like it should be easy to change bad people, doesnâ€™t it? Should be easy. Your life will be better if you just turn it down a notch, and try and get along with the rest of us. I know you donâ€™t care about anyone else, but your life will be better, and less stressed if you just turn it down a notch. Weâ€™re not even asking you to do anything extra. Just do less of what youâ€™re doing now. Start small. Start small. Donâ€™t put testicles on the back of your pickup truck. Why are you doing that? What is wrong with you? And why are you doing that? I have a minivan filled with children and old people. We donâ€™t need you teabagging us on the freeway.
Not easy to be good, you gotta work at it. Youâ€™re good people, I can tell. People at my shows are always nice people. But you gotta work at it. You all drive cars, so I know youâ€™re an asshole once in a while. Everyoneâ€™s merging, a nice beautiful day. You even surprise yourself. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, â€œNot today, you old bag. Youâ€™re not getting in front of me. No!â€ â€œI feel youâ€™re looking at me. Iâ€™m not gonna look back.â€ â€œNot today, raisin face. Not today.â€ Where the hell did that come from? Got to work at it. Be nice to people in customer service. Be nice to people in customer service. You think they want to wait on you? These people waitingâ€¦ No, youâ€™re not the queen because you walked into a restaurant. They donâ€™t want to wait on you. They justâ€¦ Itâ€™s their job. They just wanna make money, pay their rent, and buy some cocaine on the way home. And from a former busboy, be nice to the busboys, those people will lick your rolls. Be nice to people in customer service on the phone. You think these kids in India want these jobs? Helping us? No, they just want their families to survive. Can you imagine them telling their friends they got these jobs? â€œI got a job today.â€ â€œGood for you! What are you doing?â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna help Americans fix their computers over the phone.â€ â€œOh, no!â€ â€œYou donâ€™t even have a computer.â€ â€œI know.â€ â€œYou hardly speak English.â€ â€œI know.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re gonna kill you.â€ â€œI start tomorrow.â€
Iâ€™m supporting babies who cry on airplanes. Yeah. Iâ€™m team baby now. Iâ€™m always next to some businessman whoâ€™s always complaining. â€œWhoâ€™s gonna shut that damn kid up?â€ No, wait a minute. You shut up. Youâ€™re a man. Youâ€™re a man with hairy arms and a wallet. You chose to be on this flight. That baby doesnâ€™t wanna be here. No baby wants to be at 30,000 feet with their skeleton collapsing like a Poland Spring bottle. Sitting at ass level with all you middle-aged gas bags, crop dusting them on the way to your seat. No, that kidâ€™s in a bad spot right now. He should be crying on the airplane. We all should be crying on the airplane. Heâ€™s the only honest one on the goddamn plane. And let me be clear. Iâ€™m not even a fan of babies. Iâ€™m not. I made two and I still donâ€™t like â€™em. I donâ€™t trust anyone whoâ€™s heart you can see beating out of the top of their head. Useless dinner roll feet, canâ€™t stand for years. No, I donâ€™t like them. But if a kidâ€™s crying, theyâ€™re in a bad spot. Theyâ€™re at church, restaurant or on a plane. You know, let â€™em cry. You took â€™em out too early. Why you gotta take them everywhere? Theyâ€™re babies. Leave â€™em at home. Thatâ€™s a happy baby. At home, 72 degrees, naked, Cheerios stuck to their torso. Eating out of the cat dish. Thatâ€™s a happy baby. You gotta go out, putting a big pink bow on her bald head so everyone stops calling her a boy. She looks like a boy. Sheâ€™s not done yet. She looks like a man. She looks like a middle-aged man working at the docks. Give her a year, let her fill in, then take her for a ride. Now you wanna complain to me about toddlers who have their own seats in business class? Iâ€™ll listen to you. Because that should be illegal.
I travel a lot, thatâ€™s tough to take, my friends, when I donâ€™t get the upgrade, and Iâ€™m jammed in coach between two sumo wrestlers in track suits eating pretzels like a praying mantis for six hours. And the toddler standing naked in my seat, drinking a mimosa and giving me the finger through the curtain. Tough to take. Look, I understand why we get angry at babies, hearing them cry on a plane. Because youâ€™re scared. That businessmanâ€™s scared. Weâ€™re all scared. Itâ€™s scary up there. Scary. Itâ€™s scary. Weâ€™re not far from the children that we were. You get scared, hear a cry for help, and get more unnerved. That was the nice thing about being home for two years, you feel safe at home. Gives you this illusion that youâ€™ve got control over the universe. Which, of course, we donâ€™t. But at least there you know where the toilet paper is, where all the spoons go. Then as soon as you travel, itâ€™s uncertainty. Iâ€™ve had a great time with you tonight. This was a wonderful experience. I love all of you, but it was hell getting here. Soon as you get to security, youâ€™re like a third grader being yelled at by the principal. As soon as you leave your house, Securityâ€™s holding up your bag. â€œWhose bag is this?â€ â€œAh, shit. My bag.â€ â€œIs there water in here?â€ â€œMaybe.â€ â€œYouâ€™re a moron.â€ â€œNo, I can do things.â€
Then you get to the hotel, more uncertainty, right? How does the key work? How does the elevator work? Howâ€™s the remote control? Howâ€™s the thermostat work? Whose curly hair is this? How do you turn on the lamp? How do you turn on the damn lamp? Why are there so many lamps? You can never find the switch on the lamp. Is it on the base? Is it on the stem? Is it a chain? Whereâ€™s the switch? You put it on the wire, under the table? You heartless sons of bitches. Iâ€™m just a strange man in a strange town trying to survive. This is the easiest travel you could have, by the way. This is alone with a wheelie bag. Then you travel with your family. Oh. Thatâ€™s hell on Earth. A family vacation? Donâ€™t do that. Donâ€™t do that. Look, a family is a bad organization. It barely works at home. Why would you take it on the road? And Iâ€™m always so stupid. I always think, when we get to the resort, then Iâ€™ll have fun. Travel will be hell, of course, but when we get to the resort, Iâ€™ll have my time. No, you moron. Now youâ€™re in this weird reality show with obstacles being thrown at you you couldnâ€™t even dream of. They come running out of nowhere. â€œYour wife was just stung in the vagina by a jellyfish, go!â€ â€œYour mother-in-law is trying out her Spanish on the busboy and saying slightly racist comments, go!â€ Lo siento, lo siento. â€œYour youngest child broke out in hives in the middle of the night.â€ â€œThereâ€™s not a hospital for hours. What do you do?â€ What do I do? Iâ€™m gonna get a dirty Benadryl out of the bottom of my backpack, take the hair off it, give it to her, put her back in bed and hope she wakes up in the morning. Iâ€™m not a doctor. Iâ€™m a drunk dad on vacation. And news flash, the kids donâ€™t wanna be there either. No kid wants to be trapped in a hotel room with their half-naked parents. The only two people who can get them in trouble.
Your whole childhood is spent getting away from your parents. Hiding in tree houses, piles of leaves, sleeping over at your friendâ€™s house. My friends and I used to play in a drain pipe. A drain pipe that took all the human waste from the town and dumped it in the lake. Yes, thatâ€™s where we played, in the town shit pipe. And we loved it because we knew our parents would never look for us in the shit pipe. â€œTomâ€™s been gone awhile. Do you think heâ€™s in the pipe?â€ â€œNo.â€ Itâ€™s scary in the shit pipe. It was! There were ghosts and that clown from It. It was scary in there. But I would much rather be in the pipe than sitting in a hotel room at the end of the bed waiting for my father to come out of the bathroom for an hour and a half. â€œWhat are those noises?â€ â€œSounded like a bear rummaging through a dumpster filled with balloons.â€ Heâ€™d come out an hour later. â€œI wouldnâ€™t go in there if I were you.â€ â€œBut I have to go in there. Thereâ€™s nowhere else to go.â€ Walking through a toxic haze. â€œWhy does it smell like an antique pet shop in here?â€ Standing in your socks in water. â€œWhat did he do?â€ Thatâ€™s childhood, isnâ€™t it? Being stuck in your socks, in some place you didnâ€™t ask to go. Itâ€™s tough being a kid, isnâ€™t it? Itâ€™s like a hostage situation. Eighteen years being dragged around by these two kidnappers. No money, no identification. 18 years. No decision is your own. â€œGet in the car.â€ â€œWhereâ€™re we going?â€ â€œI said get in the car.â€
Thank you so much for coming. You guys were tremendous. Thank you so much. Sincerely, thank you so much. Take care of yourselves. Take care of yourselves and Iâ€™ll see you next time around. Thank you.

Please welcome to the stage, Jim Jefferies!
Hello, Toronto. Alright. Alright, look at this. Weâ€™re all out. No more fucking masks! I hated the masks. Iâ€™ll tell you whoâ€™s gonna miss the masks: chicks with good bodies but shit faces. Havenâ€™t they been getting away with murder the entire pandemic? In Australia, we call them prawns â€™cause you keep the body and throw the head away. I just got back from touring Australia, the whole place was flooded. Right? Remember three years ago, the whole place was on fucking fire? Remember that? Just before Covid, all of Australia was on fire and weâ€™re all like, â€œThe world canâ€™t get any worse than this.â€ People died. People lost their homes. The only thing reported in North America about the fires in Australia wasâ€¦
Koalas.
The koalas, yes. You all seemed very concerned about the koalas. If you saw me, youâ€™d say something. â€œIâ€™m so sorry to hear about your koalas.â€ And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ Pretty fucking cut up about the whole thing. How did they get all the press? Imagine youâ€™re a fucking wombat and your familyâ€™s just burnt to death. Now I like koalas as much as the next manâ€¦ but if any animal deserves to die, itâ€™s the koala. The koala is the laziest animal on Earth. It sleeps for 22 hours a day. The sloth sleeps for 21. It only eats eucalyptus leaves. Eucalyptus leaves are its source of food and water. There is a chemical in eucalyptus that reacts the same way to them that THC reacts to us. So theyâ€™re stoned all fucking day. Eighty percent of koalas have chlamydia. So theyâ€™re stoned with chlamydia. We all have a friend like this. And theyâ€™re up in the tree with their family, just sitting there. And the fireâ€™s blazing through the Australian bush. And all the other animals are running and jumping in the opposite direction of the flames. Not the koala. â€œItâ€™s gettinâ€™ a bit hot.â€ â€œItâ€™s probably just your chlamydia, love, go back to sleep.â€
And then when we have these natural disasters how do we rectify it as a society? We get a young Swedish girl with a twitchy eye to tell us off. Fucking Greta gets up there and sheâ€™s like, â€œI should be in school.â€
Now, I know, as soon as I mention Greta Thunberg thatâ€™s a triggering thing for a lot of women. A lot of women get upset when a man my age mentions Greta Thunberg. In your brain, a little loopâ€™s going on going, â€œHow dare you pick on a 16-year-old girl? Who do you think you are?â€
You know what? Youâ€™re right. Thatâ€™s wrong. But sheâ€™s 19 now and I fucking waited. I waited three long years to talk about this shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want about a 19-year-old. Hereâ€™s one for you: I can fuck Greta Thunberg and Iâ€™ve done nothing wrong. And I wouldnâ€™t use a condom either. Out of respect for her and the environment.
Now, I donâ€™t have a problem with Greta fundamentally. I agree with everything sheâ€™s saying. I agree with the science. I just donâ€™t wanna fucking hear it. Sheâ€™s always picking on my generation. Sheâ€™s like, â€œYour generation ruined it for my generation.â€ Not â€œmy generationâ€, Greta. Youâ€™re thinking of the c*nts before me. The generation before me did fucking nothing. My generation invented the different colored bins. Thatâ€™s all I can do, Greta. Iâ€™m fucking flat out with the different fucking colored bins. The generation before me had one bin and they threw everything into it. They didnâ€™t give a fuck. And it was a small, steel fucking Oscar the Grouch lookinâ€™ fucking bin. And it had a lid that fully detached. â€˜Cause that generation was so fucking stupid. They hadnâ€™t thought to put a hinge on the bin. So the lid and the bin could be one unit. Maybe they talked about it in the bin factory. Someone threw out the idea of the hinge, â€œI reckon we should put on a hinge.â€ And then one bloke puts up his hand, â€œYes, Neville?â€ And then Neville goes, â€œBut what if the kid wants to use the lid as a shield?â€ Oh! â€œYou fucking got me there, Neville. Why would I wanna fuck around with childhood magic? No hinge it is!â€ And then on garbage dayâ€¦ the bin company conveniently put two handles, two steel handles, on the side of the bin. So you have a couple of options on garbage day. You can get the bin by one handle, and drag it along your driveway with fucking sparks flying out of the c*nt and take it out to the curb. Orâ€¦ you can pick that bin up with the two handles and put the wet garbage up against your body, and you could waddle out to the sidewalk like this. â€˜Cause that generation was so fucking stupidâ€¦ they didnâ€™t think to put manâ€™s first invention on the bottom of the fucking bin. They didnâ€™t seeâ€¦ a heavy object that had to be moved on the regular and thought, â€œFuck me, the wheel would nail this one.â€
They missed plenty of these opportunities. We didnâ€™t have wheels on suitcases in any meaningful way until like the mid-90s. No one had wheels on suitcases. I remember my father being at the airport carrying two bags, another one under his armpit, like, â€œThereâ€™s no better way to do this.â€ We went to the airport in a fucking car. He saw wheels in motion. He was holding the wheel the entire time, couldnâ€™t fucking piece it together.
1971. 1971 was the first time the patent office got a patent for a suitcase with wheels on it. 1971 was the first time anyone on this planet thoughtâ€¦ to put wheels on a suitcase. To put that in context, we went to the moon in the 60s. This means that Neil Armstrong left his houseâ€¦ and he said to his wife, â€œNext time you see me, Iâ€™ll be on the moon.â€ And he got out to the launchpad, looked at the rocket majestically. â€œOne day, one day theyâ€™ll put rockets on bags.â€
So, letâ€™s tell some stories. This first story involves my fried DJ Qualls. Right. You might know him as the skinny guy from Road Trip or Hustle & Flow, or more importantly, Billy from Legit. Right? Soâ€¦ So DJâ€¦ DJâ€™s gay. Right? I can tell this story. He knows. Heâ€™s well-aware. Alsoâ€¦ If there are any gay people in the room this evening, welcome. Iâ€¦ Big fan of the gay community. Iâ€™ve always been pro-gay. I studied musical theater at university. I grew up in Sydney, one of the gayest cities on Earth. Me and the gays, weâ€™re down. In fact, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m an advocate. They have not said that. I like the gays. I like the LGBTQ community. I like emâ€™ all! I like the L, the B, the G, the T, the Q. In equal measures. I donâ€™t even have a favorite! I like emâ€™ all equally. I support them all equally. As individual groups. I do not support them as a collective group. Because they have fucking nothing in common. You have one bloke whoâ€™s like, â€œI like sucking dicks!â€ Another guy goes, â€œI wanna cut my dick off! We should be a group!â€
Which brings us to the transâ€¦ people. Uh, look. Hot topic in comedy. A lot of people are talking about it. Iâ€™ve worked with trans people for 20 years in this business. I have no issue with trans people. I think it must be a very hard life. You know, if there was a surgery that I could have for me to stop hating myself, Iâ€™d fucking take it. So I get it. Itâ€™s not an easy choice. Right? And thenâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got no problems with trans people, I see all the comedians, thereâ€™s Chapelle and Gervais and they told those jokes, and, umâ€¦ Everyone got upset and there was all this press. And I have no problem with trans people. But I do like press. So here we go!
As I said, I like trans people. Do you know why I like trans people? I like anyone whoâ€™s got a good story. If weâ€™re at a party and you tell me you cut your dick off, youâ€™ve caught my attention. Iâ€™ll sit and chat to you for a while. I feel like you might have some tales to tell. Can I empathize completely with a trans person? I try to, but I canâ€™t, really. Because Iâ€™ll never know what itâ€™s like to hate the body Iâ€™m living in soâ€¦ Oh, hang on, I do. Iâ€¦ Iâ€™ve never understood this argument. â€œI hated the body I live in.â€ Thatâ€™s like 98% of us. Ninety-eight percent of us get out of the shower and see ourselves in the mirror and go, â€œAwwâ€¦â€ But Iâ€™ve never wanted to cut my dick off and thatâ€™s a fundamental difference. I do consider myself a bloke with a six pack and Iâ€™d like you to see me that way as well. I like trans people. I often think they shouldnâ€™t stop transitioning. Keep going! Transition more. You ever see a trans person and think to yourself, â€œThey could do with more.â€
Let me explain. So when a man becomes a woman and I will call you a woman or them, they, her, whatever you wanna be called. I got all day. Iâ€™ll call you whatever you want, I regard you as a woman, youâ€™ve made the decision to change, I regard you as a woman. So the surgery, first thing they do is take the hormones, it lowers the bone density, it raises the voice a bit. Then they go get the surgery. So the first thing they do is, they cut the dick off and they put that on a plate. I donâ€™tâ€¦ for the life of me, I donâ€™t know why people laugh when I say, â€œYou put that on a plate.â€ What did you want me to do in this scenario? They cut the dick off and they chuck it! Of course thereâ€™s a fucking plate!
So they cut the dick off, now they have to make a hole. So they get a spoonâ€¦ at this stage, I should mention that Iâ€™m not a doctor. I have no formal medical training to speak of. So I just know this happens. Soâ€¦ They shovel a hole. But thatâ€™s just a hole. Thatâ€™s not realistic. You need flaps. And thatâ€™s where the dick meat comes into play. So theyâ€¦ They julienne some dick stripsâ€¦ and they get some 3M double-sided tape. And they put two on this side and one on that side. I donâ€™t know a lot about c*nts, but theyâ€™re not symmetrical. Soâ€¦ So then theyâ€™ve made it, right? Thatâ€™s all reallyâ€¦ Thatâ€™s good now, itâ€™s good. So they grow their hair long, make sure theyâ€™re clean shaven, right?
Then they get the fake tits. Now, here is my problem where they donâ€™t transition enough. They always get perfect tits. Believe me. They always get perfect tits. And thatâ€™s not the real female experience. They wanna be a real woman, they gotta get one titty slightly bigger than the other. And a nipple covering one for no reason. You do that, you can play any sport you want, I reckon.
Then the next one, so a woman becoming a man. How would theyâ€¦ They would have toâ€¦ Youâ€™d fill that in, wouldnâ€™t you? Youâ€™d fill it in? Cement? So they cement that in. Then they have to build a new fresh dick with that new dick smell. Maybe thatâ€™s what all the excess dick bitsâ€¦ They build a new dick. A beautiful dick. Youâ€™d ask for a good one, wouldnâ€™t ya? You wouldnâ€™t go small. Youâ€™d go, â€œGive me a nice dick.â€ Then they take the hormones, they always grow a beard. Iâ€™d grow a beard too. I understand that completely. They cut off the tits. But they always keep the full head of hair. That is not the real male experience. Whoa! If they wanna be a real man, just one of them. Just one. Shave the horse-shoe shape in, and grow a bit out the side and fuck it, whip it across. â€˜Cause they will never know the full pain of male pattern baldness. Itâ€™s fucking killer.
If you watch my early specials I think Iâ€™ve done nine, maybeâ€¦ You watch them, I get hairier and hairier as I go along. â€˜Cause I had a transplant Iâ€™ve had fuckingâ€¦ I take a tablet every day for the last 15 years to keep my hair looking this shitty. Hey, every single fucking day I have to take this tablet, if I stop, my hair falls out. Gotta keep taking it. But I have to only take it every four days now. If I take it everyday, my dick doesnâ€™t work. So I have a couple of options in life. Either I have hair and I canâ€™t fuck anyone, or Iâ€™m bald and no one wants to fuck me.
And people, you mock the bald. You tease them, itâ€™s like the last physicalâ€¦ We canâ€™t knock the fat anymore, or this or that. But itâ€™s the last physical thing people tease about. â€œHey baldy.â€ They donâ€™t give a fuck. My friend, someone polished his head at a party with a tea towel. Right? Fucking terrible shit. It really hurts. Losing your hair as a man is devastating. Devastating. So you canâ€™t joke about it anymore. And youâ€™re thinking Iâ€™m a comedian, I should have thicker skin. But no. Itâ€™s over. You cannot knock or tease male pattern baldness anymore. And these are your rules, not fucking mine. And Iâ€™ll tell you why.
Iâ€™ll tell you why. Because one woman once had her baldness mentioned in jestâ€¦ and you all lost your fucking shit, didnâ€™t ya? Fuck Jada Pinkett Smith and her bald ass fucking head! I have zero sympathy! I hope it never grows back! She has it easy! A woman losing their hair is easier than a man losing their hair. And I know you donâ€™t think it is, but it fucking is. First of all, sympathy out the fucking wazoo. They get called brave. Sir, did anyone ever call you brave? Not fucking one! Not one! She couldâ€™ve worn a wig. She couldâ€™ve worn a wig. No one wouldâ€™ve cared.
Men arenâ€™t allowed to cover their baldness up in any fucking way, and if they do, theyâ€™re considered a loser by society. If a man has a comb over, as soon as he leaves the room, youâ€™re all making little comments. â€œYou see the fucking c*nt with the comb over?â€ How dare he. How dare he try to look like he has hair like everyone else. Not allowed to wear a wig. If a man wears a wig and is found out, thatâ€™s fuckingâ€¦ Thereâ€™s no country you can move to. If a man wears a wig, and heâ€™s not found out, his entire life is lived in fear. All dayâ€™s heâ€™s like this. â€œOh, for fuckâ€™s sake! The weatherman said it wouldnâ€™t be windy!â€ Yet women are allowed to wear wigs. Women are allowed to wear wigs over full heads of hair, and theyâ€™re just having a bit of fun. Wigs for everyone, or wigs for no one!
While Iâ€™m at it, fake ponytails, hair extensions. If you canâ€™t grow it, you canâ€™t fucking have it! Do you know how disgusting it is that a part of our society with hair who are allowed to wear wigs when the bald is not? That is the equivalent of a woman who can walk getting in a wheelchairâ€¦ and wheeling herself up to a legless man trying to crawl his way home from the pubâ€¦ and she just keeps up with him and laughs.
So my point isâ€¦ DJâ€™s gay, right? Soâ€¦ Now, this is the story of how DJ Qualls came out of the closet. His friends and I knew he was gay, but it wasnâ€™t public. Me and DJ went to see Elton John in concert at his Farewell Tour, right? So weâ€™re sittinâ€™ thereâ€¦ Yeah. Iâ€™ll take any cheer I can get. Anyway, soâ€¦ We went to the concert, weâ€™re sitting there, and Eltonâ€™s at the piano and the band leaves the stage and now itâ€™s just Elton, the piano, and a spotlight. Nothing else. And Elton says, â€œThis will be the final song I perform this evening.â€ Now of course, it wasnâ€™t. He was doing that c*nty thing that musicians do. Like fucking how long as a society are we gonna play their fucking game? Every single concert we go to, â€œNo. Donâ€™t go.â€ You know theyâ€™re coming back. And we always act surprised. â€œWe did it!â€ I was next to a young fella. Maybe his first concert. He was maybe 15-years-old. Elton said, â€œThisâ€™ll be the final song.â€ And the kid lost his mind. â€œNo, Elton! No!â€ And I was like, â€œCalm the fuck down, mate. He hasnâ€™t sung â€˜Rocket Manâ€™ yet.â€ So weâ€™re there, itâ€™s a three-hour mark and Elton, right? He says, he gives a ten minute speech. A beautiful speech, Farewell Tour. He says, â€œThank you so much for following my 50 year career. Thank you so much for buying the albums and hearing the music. Without you listening to the songs, me writing them is inconsequential. And I love you. Youâ€™re the greatest fans I could have.â€
A beautiful speech, right? Very long, but it was a beautiful speech. And I turned to DJ and I went, â€œI should do that.â€ And he said, â€œDo what?â€ â€œI should thank the people who come to see me. I never do that. I tell my jokes and I piss off. I donâ€™t do that.â€ And he goes, â€œYeah, but with your fanbase someone would just yell out, â€˜Fag!â€™ Like that.â€ And as he said that, Elton John had stopped talking. And the word â€œfagâ€ just sang out. Everyone in the roomâ€™s freaking the fuck out. Theyâ€™re all turning around. Of course they think itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m elbowing DJ, â€œProbably a good time to come out. Iâ€™d come out right fucking now.â€ Elton John looks up from his piano. Stares at us, the room goes silent. Now letâ€™s break down what just happened there. Elton Johnâ€™s at the three-hour mark of his Farewell Tour and he gave a lovely speech, and someone yelled out â€œfag.â€ Who mustâ€™ve Elton thought that person was? Did he think it was someone who really hated him and had come to show after show, and was like, â€œIf I donâ€™t say it now, Iâ€™ll never say it!â€ Or did he think it was someone who had just figured it out? Maybeâ€¦ Maybe someone whoâ€™d bought the albums, listened to the music, never seen the outfits. And heâ€™s sitting with his wife like this. â€œHe wears an awful lot of sequins, doesnâ€™t he? â€œYou know what I think? I think he might be aâ€¦ fag!â€
So the next dayâ€¦ Iâ€™m performing in San Diego, and DJ came along with me to my show. And so heâ€™s, heâ€™s sitting in the wings and I tell the Elton John story that night. Iâ€™m on the stage, and I donâ€™t mention DJâ€™s name because I donâ€™t want them to know itâ€™s him. And then he walked on stage out of nowhere. He came on, and I looked at him, â€œWhat the fuckâ€™s he doing?â€ And heâ€¦ And he took the microphone from me, and he went, â€œIt was me! Iâ€™m gay!â€ And the whole place erupted. And he just waved goodnight. And then he tweeted about it right away. Tweeted it so he couldnâ€™t take it back. Thatâ€™s how he came out.
Then we went out that night and everyone was so excited for him. People from the show came up, gave him drinks and hugs, took photos. Everyoneâ€¦ It was one of the best nights Iâ€™ve ever had. Coming out looks like a lot of fun. Likeâ€¦ Like, I was gettinâ€™ jealous. â€˜Cause you know, as a hetero, weâ€™ve got nothinâ€™. You knowâ€¦ Likeâ€¦ I have no bit of information that will really ruin an elderly relativeâ€™s Christmas. So I thought about it, what have I got thatâ€™s close to coming out? I thought about it and Iâ€™ve come up with this. Itâ€™s hard to say publicly, but I have toâ€¦ live my truth. My favorite TV show is The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. I love that shit! I donâ€™t work on Monday nights â€™cause I like to follow the live tweets. Iâ€™m part of Bachelor Nation! I fuckinâ€™ love that shit. A lot of you might think Iâ€™m an idiot for enjoying that. Well, Iâ€™m not an idiot! Iâ€™m not stupid. I donâ€™t like reality shows. I donâ€™t watch Selling Sunset, or Below Deck, or any of that fuckinâ€™ shit. I like game shows. And The Bachelor is a game show, where the prize is a person. Itâ€™s a lot of people who just want to get famous. And we force two of them to get married. Itâ€™s fuckinâ€™ belter.
If youâ€™ve never seen it, Iâ€™ll walk you through The Bachelorette. Itâ€™s a 28-year-old girl. She lives in a house you never really see. Sheâ€™s in this house over here. And thereâ€™s a mansion that literally has 30 guys in it that are all fighting for her attention, right? She comes over and visits occasionally. Oh! Thereâ€™s a petition, going around the internet, for a gay bachelor. No! The Bachelor is a heterosexual show for heterosexual people, and it will remain that way, thank you very much. Iâ€™m not being homophobic. It just wouldnâ€™t logistically work. Say you got a gay bachelor, his nameâ€™s Darren. Darren lives in a house over here. Then thereâ€™s a mansion over hereâ€¦ with 30 guys. Youâ€™re getting ahead of me, Toronto, donâ€™t do that. And the producers come over to meet Darren. They go, â€œWeâ€™ve got a great group of guys. Theyâ€™re very excited to meet you.â€ â€œIâ€™m excited to meet them.â€ And then Darren walks over there. With all of his hopes and wishes and dreams inside this house. And he gets to the doorknob, and takes a breathâ€¦ and then he opens the door and theyâ€™re all fuckinâ€™ each other. And the producers, they know this isnâ€™t good for the show. So they roll up a newspaper and start wackinâ€™ â€™em. â€œGet out of it! Stop fuckinâ€™ each other!â€ They get a spray bottle. They get on of â€™em and rub their nose in their cum. â€œBad gay! Bad gay!â€ So no gay Bachelor.
Letâ€™s do The Bachelorette. The bachelorette will be a 28-year-old girl, sheâ€™s known sheâ€™ll be the bachelorette for, like, four months. She does what most women do before marriage. Sheâ€™s working out every day. Sheâ€™s eating well. If she does eat something naughty, she vomits it back up. This is a comedy show, so if there are any bulimic women in the room, donâ€™t think it goes unnoticed. Us boys appreciate that youâ€™re keeping it tight. Youâ€™re doing what the fat girls arenâ€™t willing to do.
Soâ€¦ Sheâ€™s at the front of this mansion, Sheâ€™s all bulimic, ripped and bulimic, sexyâ€¦ Sheâ€™s had her hair and makeup done professionally Sheâ€™s in a $10,000 dress that the show has given her. This woman is in her prime. She will never look better than she does at this exact moment. What a good time to fall in love, eh? I canâ€™t see any disappointment in the future. So she stands at the front of the house, then 30 limos, one by one, will drive up, and 30 different men will come out of their car. Theyâ€™ll walk up, theyâ€™ll introduce themselves, then theyâ€™ll say some line they pre-rehearsed they think will sweep her off her feet. This line will be some innocuous bit of rubbish that fuckinâ€™ means nothing. Nowâ€¦ They show up in the car, good lookinâ€™ guys, wearing a beautiful, tailored suit. Right? But because theyâ€™re in their 20â€™s, the legâ€™s up to here. Itâ€™s very important to that generation that we see their ankles. You look like c*nts.
Anywaysâ€¦ So the limousines show up, and out steps this guy, right? Heâ€™ll be handsome, wrinkly forehead handsome. And heâ€™ll walk up to her, heâ€™ll beâ€¦ â€œHi, my nameâ€™s Kevin. I believeâ€¦ that a womanâ€™s heart should be protected.â€ What the fuck does this mean? But she will think this is amazing. Sheâ€™ll just be like, â€œI also believe that a womanâ€™s heart needs protecting.â€ â€œWell maybe we should talk about that inside.â€ And then he walks off, and she loses her shit. She goes to the presenter, â€œOh, my God, itâ€™s Kevin. Kevinâ€™s the one.â€ She doesnâ€™t know fuckinâ€™ jack shit about Kevin. Kevin arrived in a car he doesnâ€™t own, in a suit heâ€™s been given walking into a mansion heâ€™s never fucking been in. Kevin could be unemployed, living with his mom in Regina. He doesnâ€™t know fuckinâ€™ Kevin.
Now on the show you need to get a rose, alright? And if youâ€™re one of the guysâ€¦ I donâ€™t watch the Canadian version. I live in America, they give roses. I assume with you guys itâ€™s, â€œI really like you, hereâ€™s a beaver pelt.â€ In the USA they give a rose, right? If youâ€™re one of these guys going, â€œI wonâ€™t get a rose this week, she doesnâ€™t like me,â€ What you do, you tell her a sob story, alright? Cause she canâ€™t fuck you off that week. Canâ€™t get rid of you that week. Sheâ€™s a bitch if she kicks you off that week. So a sob story will buy you about a week. Nowâ€¦ itâ€™s amazing how they just weave them into conversations out of nowhere. And â€™cause theyâ€™re in their 20â€™s, some of these sob stories are as weak as balls. And it always happensâ€¦ Theyâ€™ll be playing touch football, the girl comes by, they say, â€œHey, Katie, how are you?â€ And one guy will stand backâ€¦ and heâ€™ll wait â€™til he makes eye contact. Sheâ€™ll come up, and sheâ€™ll be like, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?â€ â€œOh, no. No, no. Itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s nothing, itâ€™s nothing. Itâ€™s just thatâ€¦ weâ€™re having such a good time today, I just wish thatâ€¦ my grandmother was here to see it.â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œYouâ€™re 28, mate, youâ€™re grandmotherâ€™s meant to be dead, c*nt.â€
There was a guy last season, he was raising a four-year-old boy, right? â€˜Cause his wife had died two years earlier. Thatâ€™s roses all day! Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I got married in Covid. Iâ€¦ I wouldâ€™ve waited a little longer but, I said to my wife, â€œIâ€™m worried that Covidâ€™s going to end, we must get married now.â€ She said, â€œWhy?â€ â€˜Cause my wifeâ€™s British, Iâ€™m Australian. We live in Los Angeles, right? I said, â€œCovid will end, we have to get married.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhy?â€ I go, â€œâ€˜Cause if we wait â€™til after Covid, I have to fly c*nts in from all over the world. See people I donâ€™t want to fuckinâ€™ know.â€ So we went to Vegas, just did it, and rang everyone up, â€œIt wasnâ€™t the same without you. Damn you, Covid!â€ It was the fuckinâ€™ best, man.
I love my wife, Iâ€™m lovinâ€™ being married. Iâ€™m loving it. I know. I believeâ€¦ I believe in the term, â€œHappy wife, happy life.â€ These are words to live by. Thereâ€™s never been a truer sentence in the English language than â€œHappy wife, happy life.â€ If your wife is happy, youâ€™ll be happy, the kids will be happy, everyone will be happy. It does surprise me, however, that thereâ€™s no saying that goes the other way. If my wife had a saying, it would be, â€œHappy husband, weâ€™ll see about that.â€ Or, â€œHappy husband, whatâ€™s he been up to?â€ Soâ€¦ We get married in Vegas, and then my wife gets pregnant on the wedding night. Probably mine. So she gets pregnant, it wasnâ€™t expected. We have a little boy now. Umâ€¦ Thanks. Iâ€™m not fuckinâ€™ having another one. Iâ€™m not doing it. Iâ€™m actually having a vasectomy on Monday. I had to time it after this. Iâ€™m having one on Monday. My wife doesnâ€™t want me to get one.
But I said, â€œMy body, my choice.â€
Do it!
I see why you guys like throwing that out. That seems like a fun sentence, â€œMy body, my choice.â€ I told my dad a couple weeks ago, I said, â€œDad, Iâ€™m getting a vasectomy.â€ Heâ€™s 81 years old. I said, â€œDad, Iâ€™m getting a vasectomy.â€ He said, â€œDonâ€™t do it.â€ I said, â€œWhy not?â€ He goes, â€œBecause most women, not all women, but most women they like to see the cum.â€ And I said, â€œDad, when you have a vasectomy, you still ejaculate, it just doesnâ€™t work anymore.â€ And he went, â€œOh, get one, then.â€ Thatâ€™s the fastest Iâ€™ve ever seen anyone change their opinion on fucking anything. Heâ€™s 81 years old, and all that time he thought blokes with vasectomies were shooting dust out of their dicks.
So the wife gets pregnant, right? Now, we had a baby shower. We had a little boy, we had a baby shower. Before I tell this, I have to mention, my wife is British, very posh accent, sounds like Mary Poppins, my wife, right? Sheâ€™s British, but visuallyâ€¦ sheâ€™s, umâ€¦ sheâ€™s Indian. I feel like I said that weird, didnâ€™t I? Said that a bit weird. How do I fix that? British talky talky, Indian looky looky. Alright, nailed it. Anywayâ€¦ So my wifeâ€™s Indian, sheâ€™s walking around the baby shower holding her stomach, going, â€œI hope heâ€™s brown. I want a brown baby. Not a stupid White baby.â€ Now, I wasnâ€™t offended. But imagine if the shoe was on the other foot. Imagine if I was walking around the baby shower with my friendsâ€¦ and I pointed at my wifeâ€™s stomach, and went, â€œI hope heâ€™s White. I want a White baby, not a stupid brown baby.â€
Anyway, so the babyâ€™s born. This thingâ€™s white as fuck, man. Itâ€™s so fuckinâ€™ white. This is whiter than the kid I had with the blonde Canadian woman. I donâ€™t know what happened. I was at the c*nt-end of the birth, and I saw the baby crowning, I was like, â€œSheâ€™s not gonna be happy about this!â€ My mother-in-lawâ€¦ So at this stage they take baby out, my mother-in-law has it. My wifeâ€™s being stitched up. Sheâ€™s being stitched up. Could have done more. Anyway, soâ€¦ Sheâ€™s being stitched up, the reason Iâ€™m telling you this, sheâ€™s in no mood to make a joke, sheâ€™s not joking when she says this next thing, sheâ€™s not joking. This baby that came out of the woman looks just like me. It has thin hair and one eyebrow. My mother-in-lawâ€™s there, she holds the baby next to my head, and she goes, â€œOh, my God. He looks exactly the same as Jim.â€ And my wife said, â€œSo you donâ€™t think heâ€™ll be good looking?â€ You canâ€™t argue with a woman when her c*ntâ€™s being stitched up. You just canâ€™t! So I just stand there and take it like this. â€œMaybe heâ€™ll grow up to be one of those people who pays for everything.â€
So my wifeâ€¦ Iâ€™d never seen her hornier than the last trimester of her pregnancy. Donâ€™t know if it happens to others, something to do with hormones. She wanted to fuck non-stop in the last trimester. So we go to the obstetrician. And the obstetrician says to us, my wifeâ€™s asking the doctor, and the doctorâ€™s talking about medicine things. Sheâ€™s like, â€œAnd the baby will turn around, expect this to happen, your ankles will do this,â€ sheâ€™s telling her all these things, and my wifeâ€™s so single-minded, sheâ€™s like, â€œBut can we still have sex? Are we still allowed to have sex?â€ And the doctorâ€™s like, â€œOf course! We encourage it. Itâ€™s healthy to have sex during the pregnancy.â€ And I went, â€œUhâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. Feels like it might hurt the baby.â€
That wasnâ€™t the real reason I didnâ€™t want to have sex. The real reason wasâ€¦ I thought she looked weird. Now, I know thatâ€™s not a nice thing to say, but I canâ€™tâ€¦ The dick wants what the dick wants. The dick didnâ€™t want. I told him he should want, but heâ€™s in charge, man. He didnâ€™t want. I love my wife. Iâ€™m very attracted to my wife. But when she was really pregnant, she was likeâ€¦ Sheâ€™s five foot two, sheâ€™s under a hundred pounds. She gained no weight. All she gained was a big fuckinâ€™ pot belly. She looked like fuckinâ€™ ET, man. So, I had this fuckinâ€™ horny ET, just following me around the house, like, â€œAre we going to fuck today? Are we going to fuck today?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, my God, no!â€ Itâ€™sâ€¦
Over the course of my career, Iâ€™ve told a lot of jokes, a lot of sex jokes. Lot of sex jokes. Normally theyâ€™re about cocaine, one-night stands, threesomes, prostitutes, things like that. Iâ€™m sorry, youâ€™ll not hear that this evening. Because, Iâ€™m a happily married father of two, Iâ€™m 45 years old, and itâ€™s just not my life anymore. But I still want to do some sex jokes for you. But these sex jokes are for all the people in the room who are just like me. And they have to fuck the same person every day. When you fuck the same person every day, you get good at it. You get good or you get efficient. You know each otherâ€™s buttons, and how to get them out of the room quickly.
Now I should mention something about myself. Umâ€¦ I havenâ€™t had a drink in 18 months. Right, I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t drink anymore. I think if youâ€™ve watched my career, youâ€™ve seen that Iâ€™ve had struggles. I did some of my specials completely drunk, there were some specials where I blacked out afterwards, and I donâ€™t remember the special. I justâ€¦ I had a problem. I had years that I was good, I had a handle on it, then I didnâ€™t, then it got away from me. Itâ€™s been a struggle for many years. So I want to talk to you about something important. I know a lot of you wonâ€™t like me talking about it. I hadâ€¦ somethingâ€¦ come into my life which Iâ€™ve always rejected. And this change has given meâ€¦ Weed! How fucking good is weed? I had no idea! It was a drug I never did. I was doing cocaine, and allâ€¦ pills and all that shit. I never used weed. I thought, â€œI might getâ€¦â€ Itâ€™s the fucking best! I never want to drink again, man! I donâ€™t want to drink. I much prefer being high. I donâ€™t drink anymore. Iâ€™m high and dry, baby! High and dry! I fuckingâ€¦ I get stoned, I take an edible, every fucking day. Iâ€™m a fucking koala, man! So every dayâ€¦ I drop my kid at school, and I take an edible. And I play Call of Duty for about five hours. Alright, play Call of Duty, and my wife will come in, Iâ€™ll be there, stoned, playing Call of Duty, and sheâ€™ll come in, sit next to me, and sheâ€™ll go, â€œDo you wanna fuck?â€ And Iâ€™ll be like, â€œUhâ€¦ Team Deathmatch.â€ And then sheâ€™ll look up at me. I canâ€™t say no to her. So Iâ€™m like thisâ€¦ Now get out of here, you! And sheâ€™s happy with that. That helps her move on with her day.
My wife hasnâ€™t watched me do standup for over a year because we have a kid and sheâ€™sâ€¦ Look, life is busy. She hasnâ€™t come to my shows in a year. And I said to her before this special, I said, â€œUhâ€¦ Thereâ€™s a couple of jokes about you.â€ And she was like, â€œDonâ€™t tell me, donâ€™t tell me.â€ She says, â€œI want to watch them on Netflix with you.â€ Soâ€¦ right nowâ€¦ if youâ€™re watching this on Netflix, know that Iâ€™m next to my wife like this. When youâ€™re in a long-term relationship, you settle in to four positions. You start out with more, but as the relationship gets on, you settle down to your core four. The four positions you always use. You both know your core four, but youâ€™ve never talked to each other about the core four. Right now youâ€™re thinking about your core four. And in the car ride home, youâ€™ll talk about your core four. Weâ€™re all doing two of the same. Her on top, him on top. These are classics! Theyâ€™re not going anywhere! Then the other two are variables for your relationship. And they areâ€¦ the one that helps her cum, and the one that helps him cum. Your finishing positions. I wonâ€™t tell you my wifeâ€™s finishing position, because I respect her privacy. But I will tell you mine. I used to finish in doggie when I was a younger man, but as Iâ€™ve gotten older, I now finish in whatâ€™s called â€œlazy doggie.â€ Lazy doggie is where you lay in the spoon position, grab one tit, and you rut around. Itâ€™s a fucking solid position. Itâ€™s a good position! â€˜Cause you feel like youâ€™re being active, but you still get a pillow. My wife loves me so much, that if she finishes in her position, sheâ€™ll just get off the cock, and sheâ€™ll lay in lazy doggie, and sheâ€™ll look at me and go, â€œGo on, then.â€ And Iâ€™ll be like, â€œThanks, love. I shanâ€™t be longâ€
Every now and again, you venture out of the core four. Youâ€™ll throw in an old position you used to do. Thereâ€™s one position all couples do four or five times a year. And every time, you go, â€œThis is dumb.â€ Thatâ€™s reverse cowgirl. Now in case you donâ€™t know, thatâ€™s when the girlâ€™s on top, turned around. So the ass is facing you and she justâ€¦ But she bends over, so itâ€™s not good, because the dick goes this way, and the c*nt goes that way. And theyâ€™re fighting against each other. Unless you have a big dick, and I donâ€™t, right? Itâ€™ll come out every sixth thrust or so, and you have to thumb it back in. Hello, mate. Good to see you. Back you go. Didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d see you again so soon. Back in.
Thereâ€™s another thing you only do early in a relationship, and then you fuck it off. Sixty-nine. Sixty-nine is a new relationship activity. And then you fucking never do it again. Three months it gets, 69. You do it in the beginning to act like youâ€™re free with your body. But then itâ€™s stupid. Too much geometry involved. Iâ€™m six foot tall, so I need a woman whoâ€™s five-five for the perfect 69. Any taller, Iâ€™m finger-banging behind my head, and licking her navel. Any shorter, my neckâ€™s up like this, and I feel like Iâ€™m in the front row at the movies. Thatâ€™s why you gotta give it up for the gays. Must be wonderful. You just see each other. Same height? 69. â€˜Cause those people stick together like LEGO.
Another problem with 69 is, no oneâ€™s doing their best work. I canâ€™t lick your c*nt to the best of my ability if youâ€™re sucking my dick to the best of yours, and vice versa. I canâ€™t tell youâ€¦ how many times Iâ€™ve been in 69, and Iâ€™ve thought to myselfâ€¦ â€œI havenâ€™t done anything for minutes. Should probably get back to it.â€ And then because Iâ€™m doing such a good job, sheâ€™s lost all focus! She has a cock in her mouth with zero fucking passion! You have to knee her in the head, â€œFucking get back to it!â€
You ever do the 69, where the womanâ€™s laying on her back, and the man gets on top? This is so horrendous looking, that you canâ€™t search for it in Pornhub. No one in the world has ever searchedâ€¦ Iâ€™ve tried! Theyâ€™ve never searched for this! No one wants to see it! You always get into that position by accident. Itâ€™s never your intention. Me and the wife got into it by accident, right? So Iâ€™dâ€¦ gone down her, right? Yâ€™knowâ€¦ my turn. We donâ€™t keep a tally, butâ€¦ Iâ€™m two up. Anyway, soâ€¦ I go down on her, she finishes, right? I fucking go, Iâ€™m off to the bathroom. Her heads at the end of the bed, she was lying that way, and as Iâ€™m walking by, she grabs my cock and she goes to put it in her mouth and Iâ€™m like, â€œHello!â€ I should mention at this stage, my in-laws will be watching this. Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what to tell ya. Anyway, soâ€¦ So, she starts sucking my cock and Iâ€™m like â€œGood on you! Well done, you!â€ And we go through the whole show, the whole song and dance. We all do it. She puts it in her mouth, then she sticks her tongue out, and I slap it on her tongue, andâ€¦ and she acts like thatâ€™s something she enjoys. Sheâ€™s like this, â€œAh!â€ And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œYouâ€™re having a good time.â€ Soâ€¦ sheâ€™s sucking on my dick, and her headâ€™s at the end of the bed and I donâ€™t know why I did this, but I thought â€œWhat Iâ€™ll do is whip my leg around hereâ€¦ like that!â€ And as soon as I did it, I knew Iâ€™d made an error. The ballsack was covering her nose, and andâ€¦ and the breathing became very labored. And not just her nose, theyâ€™d come over her eyes, giving her flyâ€™s eyes. And I was like, â€œThis canâ€™t be good. I have to relieve a bit of the pressure.â€ So, I put one knee up onto the mattress. But all that did was shift the balls off the eyes, onto the bridge of the nose soâ€¦ she still canâ€™t breathe but now she has a very clear view of my gaping, hemorrhoidal asshole. And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œThat canâ€™t be fun.â€ So, I put the other knee up. Then Iâ€™m up. And then I fell forward, and started licking from above, and acted like that was what I meant to do!
Now, boysâ€¦ if you ever find yourself in a situation where a woman asks for a 69 where sheâ€™s on the bottom and youâ€™re on the top, make sure you get yourself some rock-solid consent. Get a video of her saying what she expects, what she wants. Make her hold the newspaper for that day. Maybe a contract, get a notary. Thereâ€™s not enough. Because, girls, once we get started in this position, thereâ€™s no turning back. Unless your safe word isâ€¦ youâ€™re butt-fuck outta luck! If you do it on a soft, inner-spring mattress, she stands a chance! You do it on memory foam, youâ€™ll fucking kill a bitch!
Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s like to be married. Nowâ€¦ I wanna finish on this routine. I haveâ€¦ traveled the world with this job, this job has been such a blessing in my life. I just, I have beenâ€¦ I have been everywhere. Anywhere where they speak English, Iâ€™ve gotten up somewhere and told a few dick jokes. Itâ€™s fantastic. Iâ€™ll tell you what, Iâ€™ve seen all different cultures, different societies and I know who the biggest c*nts on Earth are. The biggest c*nts on Earth are the Swedes. Swedish people are the worst people on Earth. If thereâ€™s any Swedish people in the room know that youâ€™re not welcome here. Do you know Sweden was the last place in the free world to give up on Eugenics? Right up until 1974, they were sterilizing people against their will if they were disabled or had a degenerative disease. So if you had cerebral palsy, muscular distrophy, youâ€™re a dwarf, they sterilized you. Thatâ€™s 1974. Thatâ€™s recent history.
But if you go there, you canâ€™t argue with the results. Fuck me, theyâ€™re good looking! Like theyâ€™re so fucking good looking, man. Theyâ€™re so good looking, itâ€™s like theyâ€™re killing the ugly people. Now, Iâ€™m not saying theyâ€™re walking around killing people, thatâ€™s ridiculous. Iâ€™m saying theyâ€™re doing it from birth. So, thereâ€™ll be, like, a woman giving birth, thereâ€™ll be, like, a doctor, and then thereâ€™ll be, like, an official guy in the corner. And the doctor pulls the baby out and goesâ€¦ â€œNo.â€ Right? Then they throw the baby in the corner with all the other ugly, dead babies. He didnâ€™t have a plate this time. Right? And the woman, theyâ€™re such a rational breed of people, I donâ€™t think the woman would even be upset. I think sheâ€™d just be like this, â€œWas it ugly, was it? Thank you for catching it so early.â€
Urban legend has itâ€¦ that one of the ugly dead babies survived. It wasnâ€™t hit hard enough, and it was thrown into the corner. And then the other ugly dead babies kept on piling up on top of it. And it lived under there. Feedingâ€¦ off the rotting flesh. Until, eventually, it was strong enough to crawl away on its own. â€œBe free, Greta. Be free.â€
Thank you very much! I appreciate it! Youâ€™re awesome!

Ladies and gentlemen, Dave Chappelle.
[Cheers and applause]
â™ªâ™ª â™ªâ™ª â™ªâ™ª
Thank you. Thank you very much for being here. Before I start tonight, I just wanted to read a brief statement that I prepared.
[Laughter]
â€œI denounce anti-Semitism in all its forms.â€
[Laughter]
â€œAnd I stand with my friends in the Jewish community.â€
And that, Kanyeâ€¦ is how you buy yourself some time.
[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]
I got to tell you guys, I probably been doing this 35 years now. And early in my career, I learned that there are two words in the English language that you should never say together in sequence, and those wordsâ€¦ are â€œtheâ€ and â€œJews.â€
[Laughter]
Iâ€™ve never heard someone do good after they said that.
[Laughter]
Kanyeâ€™s gotten into some scrapes before. Normally when heâ€™s in trouble, I pull up immediately. But this time, I was like, â€œYou know what? Let me see whatâ€™s going to happen first. I just want to see â€” just want to see where this is all going.â€
[Laughter]
I canâ€™t even remember how it started. Vaguely I remember it started with a tweet, strange tweet. It was like, â€œIâ€™m feeling a little sleepy.â€
[Laughter]
â€œIâ€™m going to get me some rest, but when I wake up, Iâ€™m going to go DEFCON 3 on the Jews.â€
[Laughter]
And then he just went to bed. I was up all night worried. What is he gonna do to the Jews?
[Laughter]
I grew up around Jewish people. I have a lot of Jewish friends, so Iâ€™m not freaked out by your culture. I know a little bit about it just from hanging around. Be like, â€œYo, yo, letâ€™s go out after school tomorrow.â€ Theyâ€™d be like, â€œWe canâ€™t go out. Itâ€™s Sha Na Na tomorrow.â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œWhat?â€
[Laughter]
What is Sha Na Na? I had so many questions. Why do some of your people dress like Run-DMC?
[Laughter]
When Kanye woke up from that nap, he went to work.
[Laughter]
A year ago, Iâ€™d seen him on a podcast called â€œDrink Champs.â€ Great show, and it was an amazing appearance. Noreaga and them were there, rappers that I love, and they all had their gold chains and stuff on. And Kanye said, â€œOnly millionaires wear chains.â€ They said, â€œWhat?â€ He said, â€œIâ€™m a billionaire. Billionaires donâ€™t wear their money on their body.â€ I took my chain and I said, â€œOh, snap.â€
[Laughter]
Thatâ€™s right. It was a good appearance. It was fun and funny. But when he woke up, he went on â€œDrink Champsâ€ again. This time, he was on one, mad about something. He said, â€œI can say anti-Semitic things, and Adidas canâ€™t drop me. Now what?â€ Adidas dropped that n*gga immediately.
[Laughter]
Ironically, Adidas was founded by Nazis, and they were offended.
[Laughter]
I guess the student surpassed the teacher.
[Laughter]
Itâ€™s a big deal. He had broken show-business rules. Itâ€™s just a rule. You know, the rules of perception. If theyâ€™re black, then itâ€™s a gang. If theyâ€™re Italian, itâ€™s a mob. But if theyâ€™re Jewish, itâ€™s a coincidence and you should never speak about it.
[Laughter]
Kanye got in so much trouble, Kyrie got in trouble.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
Kyrie Irving posted a link to a movie that he had seen on Amazon. No caption on the post or nothing like that. But apparently this movie had some, I donâ€™t know, anti-Semitic tropes or something. It was some weird title like â€œFrom Hebrew to Negroâ€ or something.
[Laughter]
And the NBA told him he should apologize, and he was slow to apologize. And then the list of demands to get back in their good graces got longer and longer. And this â€” this is where, you know, I draw the line. I know the Jewish people have been through terrible things all over the world, but you canâ€™t blame that on black Americans. You just â€” You just canâ€™t.
Whoo!
You know what I mean? Thanks, the one person that said â€œWhoo.â€
[Laughter, applause]
A fair punishment would be he should just post a link to â€œSchindlerâ€™s Listâ€ and yâ€™all write your own captions.
[Laughter]
Kyrie Irvingâ€™s black ass was nowhere near the Holocaust. In fact, heâ€™s not even certain it exists.
[Laughter]
I saw one news pundit screaming about Kanye. She said, â€œMental health is no excuse for that type of language.â€ Yes, it is, bitch. You would kill somebody if youâ€™re mentally ill. Listen, okay, I donâ€™t think Kanye is crazy at all. I think heâ€™s possibly not well.
[Laughter]
Iâ€™ve been to Hollywood. Donâ€™t want yâ€™all to get mad at me. Iâ€™m just telling you. Iâ€™ve been to Hollywood. This was just what I saw. Itâ€™s a lot of Jews.
[Laughter]
Like, a lot.
[Laughter]
But that doesnâ€™t mean anything. You know what I mean? Thereâ€™s a lot of black people in Ferguson, Missouri. Doesnâ€™t mean we run the place.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
I can see if you had some kind of issue. You know what I mean? You might go out to Hollywood. And your mind might start connecting some kind of lines, and you could maybe adopt the delusion that the Jews run show business. Not a crazy thing to think. But itâ€™s a crazy thing to say out loud in a climate like this.
[Laughter]
Now the midterms are over, and itâ€™s a crazy climate. And I got to tell you, I feel like this midterm was like all of humanity depends on it. And itâ€™s an ominous sign. The most ominous sign of the midterms, I believe, would be Herschel Walker, who I â€” I donâ€™t want to speak badly of because heâ€™s black. But I have to admitâ€¦ heâ€™s, umâ€¦ heâ€™s observably stupid.
[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]
Even when heâ€™s not talking, his mouth be open a little bit, likeâ€¦
[Laughter]
Heâ€™s the kind of guy that looks like he thinks before he makes a move on tic-tac-toe.
[Laughter]
And watching the news now, theyâ€™re declaring the end of the Trump era. Now, okay, I can see how in New York you might believe this is the end of his era. Iâ€™m just being honest with you. I live in Ohio amongst the poor whites.
[Laughter]
A lot of you donâ€™t understand why Trump was so popular. But I get it, â€™cause I hear it every day. Heâ€™s very loved. And the reason heâ€™s loved is because people in Ohio have never seen somebody like him. Heâ€™s what I call an honest liar. Iâ€™m not joking right now. Heâ€™s an honest liar. That first debate â€” That first debate, Iâ€™d never seen anything like it. Iâ€™ve never seen a white male billionaire screaming at the top of his lungs. â€œThis whole system is rigged!â€ he said. And across the stage was a white woman, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama sitting over there looking at him like, â€œNo, itâ€™s not.â€ I said, â€œNow, wait a minute, bro. Itâ€™s what he said.â€ And the moderator said, â€œWell, Mr. Trump, if, in fact, the system is rigged, as you suggest, what would be your evidence?â€ Remember what he said, bro? He said, â€œI know the system is riggedâ€¦ because I use it.â€ I said, â€œGod damn!â€
[Laughter]
And then he pulled out an Illuminati membership card and chopped a line of cocaine up and did it right at the podium.
[Laughter, applause]
No one had ever heard someone say something that true. And then Hillary Clinton tried to punch him in the taxes. She said, â€œThis man doesnâ€™t pay his taxes.â€ He shot right back, â€œThat makes me smart.â€
[Laughter]
And then he said, â€œIf you want me to pay my taxes, then change the tax code, but I know you wonâ€™t because your friends and your donors enjoy the same tax breaks that I do.â€ And with that, my friends, a star was born. No one had ever seen anything like that. No one had ever seen somebody come from inside of that house outside and tell all the commoners, â€œWeâ€™re doing everything that you think we are doing inside of that house.â€ Then he just went right back in the house and started playing the game again.
[Laughter]
Democrats were sore losers. Iâ€™m a Democrat, and Iâ€™m telling you, as soon as he won, they started saying all that â€” â€œHeâ€™s colluding with Russia. Heâ€™s colluding with Russia.â€ It was very embarrassing as a Democrat. But as time went on [Sighs] we all came to learnâ€¦ he was probably colluding with Russia.
[Laughter]
I even look at his wife different now. His wife is beautiful, no question about it. But she looks like the kind of chick that James Bond would smash but not trust.
[Laughter]
[Applause]
Why he got all them documents at his house? What is this? This a guy thatâ€™s famous for not reading his press briefings. Now all of a sudden he got 10,000 documents at his house, gonna catch up on his reading list.
[Laughter]
I have been fired from jobs many times in my life, and I will be very honest with you. Sometimes when I was fired, I stole things from the office. Staplers, computer mouses, all kinds of stuff. But you know what I never stole from work? Work.
[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]
War in Ukraine brought it all into focus. And lucky for everybody in the Western world the Ukrainians are way better fighters than we thought theyâ€™d be. I mean, these guysâ€¦ God bless them. Theyâ€™re doing good.
[Cheers and applause]
They killed 10,000 Russians the first week of the war. Even the Vietnamese were like, â€œGod damn. Them some good numbers!â€
[Laughter]
This was before they had weapons. Before we started sending them weapons, they was killing Russians with things you can find around the house. That whole country, Ukraine, is littered with traps like Home Alone. They were stepping on rakes and touching hot doorknobs. â€œAah!â€
[Laughter]
How is Russia losing to the Ukraine? That would be like America losing a war to Colorado.
[Laughter]
Now the midterms are over, and everybodyâ€™s awake. These new whites, man, theyâ€™re like â€” The whites are like â€” Theyâ€™re like â€” Theyâ€™re like newborn babies, just woke up. Everything white people mad about, weâ€™ve been on that. â€œMan, I canâ€™t feed my family.â€ Black people like, â€œWe been on that!â€ â€œMan, we canâ€™t trust the government.â€ We been on that. â€œMan, we should dismantle the FBI.â€ Word to Martin Luther King, bro. Weâ€™ve been on that.
[Cheers and applause]
Nobody listens to me. When I tell these jokes, you ignore me. My first Netflix special, what did I say? I said, â€œI donâ€™t want a sneaker deal, â€™cause the minute I say something that makes those people mad, theyâ€™re going to take my sneakers away.â€ And the whole crowd was like, â€œHa ha ha ha ha ha.â€ Now you see Kanye walking around L.A. barefoot with his chain out.
[Laughter]
This guy lost a billion and a half dollars in a day. A billion and a half dollars in a day. I saw that and I said, â€œPut your chain on, n*gga. Welcome back.â€
[Laughter, cheers and applause]
It shouldnâ€™t be this scary to talk about anything. Itâ€™s making my job incredibly difficult. And to be honest with you, Iâ€™m sick of talking to a crowd like this. I love you to death, and I thank you for your support. And I hope they donâ€™t take anything away from me.
[Laughter]
Whoever they are.
[Laughter]
We got a great show tonight!
[Cheers and applause]
Brooklynâ€™s finest Black Star is in the building!
[Microphone thuds]
[Cheers and applause]

Whatâ€™s in a Name? is a 40-minute talk Chappelle delivered at Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, D.C., on June 20, 2022

Art is dangerous. It is one of the attractions: when it ceases to be dangerous you donâ€™t want it.
Duke Ellington
Amid the controversy of Dave Chappelleâ€™s Netflix release â€œThe Closer,â€ Duke Ellington School of the Arts resolved to name its newly renovated theatre â€œDave Chappelle Theatre.â€ The following is Daveâ€™s acceptance speech for that honorâ€¦
[Dave Chappelle] Thisâ€¦ isâ€¦ surreal.
[cheering and applause]
In 1987â€¦ 1987, I moved backâ€¦ from Ohio to D.C. Andâ€“ andâ€“ and enrolled in Eastern High School, and didâ€¦
[audience member] Whoo!
You must not have went there when I went there, champ. Those were tough times is the way I remember it. [chuckles] [groans]
When I had gone, Iâ€“ I had lived with my father for three years. I went to middle school in Ohio, and when Iâ€™d gotten back to Washington, the crack epidemic was in full swing, and the city was largely unrecognizable to me. Now I was an older kid, andâ€“ andâ€“ and kids my age were doing a lot of wild things that Iâ€“ I didnâ€™t know that kids would do. Iâ€“ Iâ€™d never seen a kid with a pager before, I didnâ€™t know anything about selling drugs, any of that shit. All I knew, every day when I went to Eastern, I didnâ€™t feel safe. [groans]
Iâ€™m a quiet guy, naturally. Iâ€™m a shy person, naturally. And I used to get my hair cut on a barbershop on 15th Street Northeast. And I would go there, and, uhâ€¦ and everyone in the barbershop would just snap on each other. And Iâ€™d sit in the corner, and Iâ€“ and Iâ€™d watch everybody, and just listen to all these jokes. The guys were funny as shit, butâ€“ but one day, after a few weeks of goinâ€™ there and gettinâ€™ my hair cut, theyâ€“ theyâ€“ they turned the jokes on me. I call that day The Barbershop Massacre. I lit everybody in that barbershop up, I had been sittinâ€™ in there listening to â€™em for weeks talk about each other, I knew every inside joke about each and every one of â€™em, and they couldnâ€™t believe I knew this stuff. I lit their asses up.
From then on in the neighborhood, people kind of liked me, like, â€œOkayâ€¦ heâ€™s pretty funny.â€ Time magazine released an article about Bill Cosby. The headline said, â€œFifty, Funny, and Filthy Rich,â€ and I read that article and it was when I was looking at his face, before all that disgrace, that I looked and I said, â€œI could do that.â€ I told my father and my father said, â€œWell, then just do it.â€ I said, â€œWell, I wouldnâ€™t even know where to start,â€ and he said, â€œWell, look in the phone book.â€ Itâ€™s before the internet, if youâ€™re young. We used to have a book with phone numbers in it.
My father found for me the local comedy club in Washington, D.C. I called â€™emâ€¦ I found out when Open Mic night was, and I started to go there on Tuesday nightsâ€¦ and just watch. And then one night I went on a weekend. I wouldâ€“ I would get my money together and I would go to this comedy club and I would just watch these comedians, and sometimesâ€¦ sometimes they would talk to me. And I told one of the comedians after the show one night, I said, â€œMan, I really wanna try to do this.â€ Andâ€“ and he said, â€œWellâ€¦â€ He saidâ€¦ He said, â€œIf you wanna be a good comedian, you should know how to act.â€ I said, â€œWhy?â€ And he says, you knowâ€¦ He didnâ€™t explain it. I said, â€œOkay,â€ and I told my parents, andâ€“ and this is how I came to find out about Duke Ellington. My mother, she said, â€œThereâ€™s a place you can go where you can learn to act right in Washington. Itâ€™s aâ€“ Itâ€™s a high school.â€ I said, â€œYou mean I wouldâ€¦ get out of Eastern?â€ The school year was already in full swing and Ellington has a policy that they donâ€™t let people just come in the middle of the year, but Lynda Gravatt was the head of the theater department at the time. Very graciously took a meeting with me and my mother, andâ€¦ I get emotional thinking about it. Anybody that went here?
[crowd cheers]
Remember what it was first like?
[audience members] Yes! Yes!
When you first walked through the door? It was in the afternoon, and everyone was in their arts classes, and the girls had tutus on, and everyone was weird, and walking around the hallway, like, you werenâ€™t sure where anyone was supposed to be, and you could hear people practicing their horns and shit all through the hallways. There was art bouncing off the walls, the minute I walked through the door, there was a gallery ofâ€“ of all these childrenâ€™s work and these pictures were amazing.
My first thoughtâ€¦ when I walked through that door: â€œIâ€™m not good enough to be here. Iâ€™m sure.â€
And Miss Gravatt sat me down, she told me about the school, and you remember Miss Gravatt? She was very businesslike. But also very warm. She was intimidating, but palpably kind. She was a paradox of a human being. She gave me a date for an audition. My mother said, â€œOkay, Dave, itâ€™s on you.â€
Nowâ€¦ Those of you who know meâ€¦ know that I didnâ€™t prepare for that audition. That audition was like aâ€“ a possession, it was just something that I was proud to have.
But as the days got closer, Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, my God, I gotta getâ€“ I gotta get something together.â€ I didnâ€™t even know how to do an audition, And I had never done it before, so I went and I saidâ€“ I said, â€œWhat do I need?â€ They said, â€œA monologue,â€ Iâ€¦ So I looked up â€œmonologue.â€ And I went to the library, the MLK Library, this huge library, so I gotta find something, and I found a piece in one of those yellow script books, it was a monologue by Mark Twain called â€œThe Judgeâ€™s Spirited Woman.â€ And I learned it in a night. You know, it was not hard for me to memorize things.
The next day, it was a Saturday, I think, and I came to the school, and they auditioned in what used to be this roomâ€“ the originalâ€¦ theater, Duke Ellington School of the Arts. And all the department heads sat in here, and the lightâ€™s in your eyes, and thereâ€™s a bunch of kids who already go to the school, who come on Saturday, just to seeâ€¦ who might be coming.
And I talked to all these kids before I went in, and these kids were nothing like the kids at Eastern. They were like them, but they were different, they were weird, funny, and self-deprecating, things like this.
And I remember I came out on stageâ€¦ and I did my audition, and it was likeâ€¦ like, terrible. Iâ€“ I froze up in the beginning, I started, and then I said, â€œWait a minute, Iâ€™m messing up, Iâ€™m gonna start again.â€ [sighs] And I was nervous, and I was scared, andâ€¦ andâ€¦ in the middle of the audition, Iâ€™m in the middle of the monologue, uh, one of the teachers, Fred Lee, he saidâ€“ Fred Lee, he goes, â€œOkay, thatâ€™s enough.â€ I said, â€œWell, thereâ€™s still a little more,â€ he goes, â€œNo, no, no, no, noâ€¦ That is enough,â€ he said.
And Iâ€“ I canâ€™t tell you, like, Iâ€“ I was crushed. Uhâ€¦ without saying his disapproval, I knew it stunk. And I was right. When I walked in here, I knew I wasnâ€™t good enough to go to this school. And I thought to myself, â€œAh, fuck this school, thatâ€™s stupid anyway.â€
In first-year theater, thereâ€™s a question that they ask students from time to time. And itâ€™s a make-or-break question, andâ€¦ And we ask this question, you donâ€™t know. And the question is this: They say, â€œWhy do you wanna act?â€ Nowâ€¦ if you say anything like, â€œI wanna be a star,â€ youâ€™re notâ€¦ Youâ€™re not gonna get in. I didnâ€™t know that. And I figured I already blew the audition, so I told them the truth. He said, â€œWhy do you wanna act?â€ â€œI donâ€™t.â€ Thatâ€™s what I said. And they said, â€œWell then, why are you here?â€ I said, â€œBecause I wanna be a comedian and some comedian told me that if I wanna be a good comedian, I need to learn how to act.â€ And the teachers look at each other and go, â€œThank you very much,â€ and I left. And I was walking down the hallway kicking rocks.
It was a kid that already went here, his name was Ako Handy. And Ako said, â€œHey, man, I listened to them talking about you.â€ I said, â€œYou did?â€ He said, â€œYouâ€™re in.â€ I said, â€œWhat?â€ He said, â€œYouâ€™re in.â€ But it didnâ€™t make any sense. Somehow we worked it out so that they gave me an early enrollment, and I left Eastern within weeks of that, and I came to Duke Ellington and it was better than I could have ever imagined.
I didnâ€™t have the suspicion that most new kids get. I was an oddity, a new toy, I was quirky, I wasnâ€™t a snappy dresser, I didnâ€™t really know what the fuck was going on, because the crack epidemic itself was new to me and they were all refugees from their neighborhood schools. In the morning, we would have our academic classes, and then in the afternoon, we would have our arts classes. It was a long school day. Weâ€™d start at 8:30, we wouldnâ€™t leave here â€™til five, sometimes 5:30. Whenever they saw fit.
Itâ€™s funny walking in here tonight, â€™cause I saw the Pride flags up, and I remember when I came here all those years ago, itâ€™s the first time I ever met a kid who was just, like, gay. It was never strange to us. Their sexuality or their gender identity was the least remarkable thing about a person that could dance as well as Roger Bellamy, orâ€¦
There was no distinction between any of that. Everybody was weird in their own way. And in a very strange way, because we spent so much time with one another. We helped raiseâ€¦ one another.
Thereâ€™s a camaraderie between these students that I donâ€™t know that Iâ€™ve seen since I left this school. I can remember, and I wonâ€™t say names, there was a student that went here that used to sell drugs. It wasnâ€™t just a student, but this particular guyâ€¦ This particular guy did the cardinal no-no on the streets. He did what they call â€œnot making your roll,â€ which meant he got some drugs on consignment and he didnâ€™t pay whoever gave him the drugs back. And whoever gave him those drugs had declared, â€œIâ€™m gonna come to that school, and Iâ€™m gonna kill you,â€ he said. And my man was scared, and word got around, around school, that the goons was coming. And by the time the goons showed up, every dude that went to this school: gay, straight, whatever the fuck, was all standing out front, they say, â€œYouâ€™ll have to kill all of us.â€ And who was in front of all of â€™em? Roger Bellamy with some leg warmers on like this.
I started making friends that are still my friends to this very day. Life-long friends.
As I get older, I appreciate my teachers more and more. But to tell you the truth, I appreciated them then. Teacher salaries, you know, not necessarily what it should be. And when I think about that, juxtaposed to the dedication that the teachers, the time they would spend with me, the way they would notice, â€œAre you okay? Is everything all right? You look sad today.â€ Any little thing, like a family member would. And they fostered an environment of almost absolute trust, like your parents.
Thereâ€™s two lectures that I got at school that changed the way I do comedy. That likeâ€¦ turned the light switch on. It was two teachers: Donal Leace. Donal Leace, may he rest in peace. Maybe one of the single best educators that Iâ€™ve ever met in my life. He had a demeanor about himself that demanded excellence from his students. He would tell us incredible stories that I didnâ€™t believe. He claimedâ€¦ in one class, the song â€œKilling Him Softlyâ€ was about him. I was like, â€œNah, n*gga, not you.â€ He told me he knew Donny Hathaway and Roberta Flack and all these people. These D.C. legends.
Heâ€™s a humble man, but he really demanded excellence. And he gave us a lecture once on a concept called polarization. Polarization meaning theâ€“ the idea that if you can make everybody look at the same thing at the same time, that their rational mind will decrease, and their emotional response will increase. He said, â€œThatâ€™s how audiences work, thatâ€™s how mobs work, thatâ€™s how you make a person lose themself in the crowd.â€
I got it. As he was saying this, he would hold a stapler in his hand, it was a good lecture. He said, â€œEveryone focus on the stapler,â€ and he would explain to us what polarization is as weâ€™re all looking at this stapler, and then heâ€™d scream, â€œHah!â€ And everyone would jump, â€œOh!â€ He said, â€œWhatâ€™re you scared of?â€ â€œOh, shit, that works.â€
And ever since he did that lecture, I listened in his class intently. He was one of the only guys that I would always get straight As from because I worked very hard, not to get his approval, but to avoid his disapproval.
When we were coming up, they had a thing called juries. I donâ€™t know, do they still do juries? Juries is when all the department heads give you a piece to work on, and they sit there, and they make you perform the piece, and the criticism is brutal. And we were kids. We didnâ€™t understand that they were preparing us for a hard world ahead if you wanted a profession in art. They would tear us to shreds. Just the stressâ€¦ The stress of a jury. And man, I never practiced. â€˜Cause I didnâ€™t wanna act.
At an improv class, a teacher named Geraldine Gillstrap told me that she shouldâ€“ I should stop doing funny pieces. That I should try to stretch myself artistically. And maybe had more in me than comedy. And at the time, I took offense to that. So because she said that, after school that very night, I went to the comedy club, and for the first time I signed the list, and I waited, and I got on, and I killed it. Killed it. Must have been 35 years ago, night after night, I killed it. Iâ€™d show up with the bag of tricks that I learned at school, and I would dominate adults on a regular basis.
Couldnâ€™t wait to get out of D.C. When I was 17, I moved to New York and lit that comedy scene up. I was obviously talented. Youâ€™ll hear stories about people saying that I discovered Dave Chappelle. Thatâ€™s like saying you discovered sunshine. I was shining on everybody.
And when I got in that professional world, I was oddly prepared. I had a sense of professionalism, I showed up on time, I did the things that I learned in school to do. Just the basics. Myâ€¦ career didnâ€™t have any direction â€™cause I was still so young. And that didnâ€™t change for many years.
It didnâ€™t change until, uhâ€¦ my girlfriend at the time, now my wife, told me she was pregnant, and I was like, â€œYou know what? I should really start taking this seriously.â€
And when she told me that, before the baby was born, Iâ€™d done my first HBO special, and thenâ€“ and then I went to work on a sketch comedy show idea I had, andâ€“ andâ€“ and The Chappelle Show came out when my son was still maybe 18 months-year old. And I bet on myself. I took less money. I took less money, I remember that, so I could do what I wanted to do. I said, â€œYou donâ€™t have to pay me that much, but you canâ€™t ever tell meâ€¦ You canâ€™t ever tell me that I canâ€™t do what I wanna do.â€ And I did the first season, Iâ€™ll tell you, for $300,000. Which sounds like a lot of money, butâ€“ butâ€“ butâ€“ butâ€“ butâ€¦
It was a rare experience in my life, because it was the first time that I did something that was so successful that I knew I had exceeded the expectations. I was more successful than I felt like I was supposed to be. They didnâ€™t plan on that.
The second seasonâ€¦ came out, and it was a juggernaut, andâ€“ andâ€“ andâ€¦ and then, I remember this was the single best day of my career, the Rick James episode of Chappelle Show had come outâ€¦ People were going crazy about the Rick James episode at the same time theâ€“ the DVD for Season 1 of Chappelle Show dropped. It was the first time any television show had ever been sold off air. And it sold a million copies in the first day. It was unheard of. To this day, nothing has sold more than Chappelle Show. Itâ€™s still on the Top Ten in Netflix.
All those great things happened, and my contract was up. Clearlyâ€¦ Clearly, I was about to be rich.
Iâ€™ll spare you all the details of why it didnâ€™t work out. But it didnâ€™t work out. And I ended up doing something that no one had ever seen before, including myself. Maybe Prince is the only other guy that Iâ€™ve seen do this, where you just quit something that was popular when youâ€™re at the very top of it.
Lucky for me, when I quit, I went to Africa, so there was a media storm that I didnâ€™t hear. By the time I got back, everyone was just lookinâ€™ at me crazy. That was a very difficult decision to make. The entire world told me I was crazy, but Iâ€“ I was sureâ€¦ I was sure I was being true to myself and to something that I learned at Ellington.
Iâ€™m one of those comedians that thought of himself as an artist. I was enamored by what the genre could do. It was likeâ€¦ the pictures that I could paint with words, and the way I could engage with audiences. I understood as it was happening, I was very lucky to be able to do this. And I protected that. And I knew that if I took the money, they would expect me to behave differently, and I wasnâ€™t willing to accept that, so I quit. And when I quit, it was a very difficult time in my life, that Iâ€™ll spare you the details, but man, fuck show business. It was tough.
And then one day I was in Panama City, Panama, and I was in a hotel, and I looked at the lobby, there was aâ€“ a painting of Abraham Lincoln. Wasâ€“ And thenâ€“ I would look closer, it wasnâ€™t a painting, it was all pennies, just pennies on a black canvas, arranged into the face of Abraham Lincoln. And I asked the guy, I said, â€œHow much is that painting worth?â€ He said, â€œ$600,000, sir.â€ And I looked at the pennies that made up the painting, and I was like, â€œThatâ€™s like, $300 worth of pennies.â€
Lightbulb went in my head. I realized the value of art. Some of the biggest wars and crimes and scams in history were financed through the theft of art. Art is a powerful commodity. An artist, if youâ€™re good at it, should never behave as a commodity. Itâ€™s a tough one.
And then I gave up. â€˜Cause itâ€“ I said, â€œOhâ€“ you know, this is probably it.â€ I accepted the fact that the career I thought I was gonna have was over, but, I started to rediscover just my art for its own sake. I would go to comedy clubs and Iâ€™d work for way less money than I ever had, and I enjoyed it more than any of the work I ever did. It was probably the best work Iâ€™ll ever do. â€˜Cause it was so honest. It was so sincere. There was no media, there was no studio, there was no scrutiny, just me and the crowds. And I did it night after night, and slowly but surely the crowds got bigger and bigger, and then suddenly people started to notice. In post, I would say, â€œDave Chappelle has the tour of the year.â€ And again, and then the year after that, and then the year after that.
And then, Lorne Michaels asked me to do Saturday Night Live. And it wasnâ€™t just like he asked me, he was courtinâ€™ me, I didnâ€™t even know it, he gave me this whole long speech, and I was like, â€œAll right.â€ And then I read some book about Lorne Michaels starting Saturday Night Live, and I read the speech that he gave Richard Pryor when he wanted him to host the show, and I said, â€œHoly shit, thatâ€™s the same shit he said to me!â€
And I did it. And that was an enormous amount of pressure, it had been 12 years since Iâ€™d been on television, or since Iâ€™d even talked to the media, and I remember I signed my Netflix contract on my way to my mark for the monologue. If you do live television, they count down every second, â€œ30 secondsâ€¦â€ â€œAre you sure this contract is good?â€ â€œItâ€™s good, just sign the papersâ€¦â€ â€œ22 secondsâ€¦â€ â€œAw, nigga, you better not be trickinâ€™ me.â€
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, I walked out on that stage, and I killed it. It was natural. It was nothing. It was easy work. Got an Emmy for that one, too. First Emmy I won. And when I walked on the stage after being in the cold for so long, for the first time when I walked on the stage, Iâ€™m like, â€œDamn, n*gga, I just made 60 million dollars.â€ Thatâ€™s what I thought to myself. Itâ€™s been great ever since. And really I could do these specials like Steph Curry, I be shooting from inside, outside, all night. Itâ€™s been great ever since.
A lot of my friends are athletes, and I never could understand what it would feel like to only have a limited amount of time to be great. You got 20 years to be the best, or 30 years to be the best, but when you do art, you could be great whenever the will decides that youâ€™re great. And I feel very lucky for that.
And I never forgot this school. Iâ€™ve always come back, checked in. One of my favorite honors was doing the commencement at Ellington. Listen, I canâ€™t even remember what year it is. I just remember they cheered for me when I came out, I wasnâ€™t a big star, but I was their star, and I felt like I was home.
After I did Lorne Michaels, I mean, after I did Saturday Night Live, Lorne Michaels said something that I gotta share with you. He goes, â€œYou went to Peggy Cafritzâ€™s school, didnâ€™t you?â€ Thatâ€™s what he said. I said, â€œI did,â€ and he saidâ€¦ he saidâ€“ I wanted to say this on Saturday Night Live. He goes, â€œTell her I owe her money.â€
You know, I never asked to have this theater named after me. Peggy asked me. She was ailing, and I went to her house to visit her. And she said, â€œI want you to put your name on the school,â€ she said, â€œIt would help us raise money for the school,â€ and to me, it was like, I felt like Iâ€™m a little young for that, and Iâ€™m still kind of using the name, you know what I mean? Letâ€™s see what I do with it first! You never knowâ€¦ Like, imagine if O.J. had named his son O.J. Junior. â€œOh, Dad!â€
And around then, I was receiving the Mark Twain Prize. Huge honorâ€¦
Andâ€¦
[audience applauds]
And the next day, all the artists that came to honor me, the Bradley Coopers and Chris Tuckers, and all these great people who came to Ellington and they taught master classes for the students. And Peggy Cooper Cafritz, as sick as she was, got out of her bed, so she could be with her babies. She never left us. So I did it. So, you know, whatever you wanna do, if I can help, Iâ€™ll do it.
Now I have to tell you: if you quit a show like Chappelle Show, I donâ€™t know if you know what happens to you professionally, but Iâ€™ll tell you what doesnâ€™t happen. They donâ€™t just say, â€œWell, good luck in your future endeavors.â€ With that media, they beat me up. With their power, they tried to make me behave, itâ€™sâ€“ -itâ€“ it takes a strong person to stand out in the cold like that, and I swear to God, so much of the strength I got to do that, the inner warmth I got to do that, I learned in this school, and from my friends who helped raise me.
So why wouldnâ€™tâ€¦ Iâ€™d do anything I could to help my benefactor. And the last time I came back, after The Closer, when the kids were mad at me, I got to tell you, that was quite the day. All the kids was screaming and yelling, I remember, I said to the kids, I go, â€œWell, okay, well what do you guys think I did wrong?â€ And a line formed. These kids said everything about gender, and this and that and the other, but they didnâ€™t say anything about art. And this is my biggest gripe with this whole controversy with The Closer: that you cannot report on an artistâ€™s work, and remove artistic nuance from his words. It would be like if you were reading a newspaper and they say, â€œMan Shot in the Face by a Six-Foot Rabbit Expected to Survive,â€ youâ€™d be like â€œOh, my God,â€ and they never tell you itâ€™s a Bugs Bunny cartoon.
I took a lot of cold shotsâ€¦ in show business. And I gotta tell you, as the years go on, you feel the shots less and less. â€œAh, itâ€™s just the business,â€ is what you say. But that one, that day, boy, that day they hurt me. When I heard those talking points coming out of these childrenâ€™s faces, that really, sincerely, hurt me. Because I know those kids didnâ€™t come up with those words, Iâ€™ve heard those words before. The more you say I canâ€™t say something, the more urgent it is for me to say it. And it has nothing to do with what youâ€™re saying I canâ€™t say. It has everything to do with my right, my freedomâ€¦ of artistic expression. That is valuable to me. That is not severed from me. Itâ€™s worth protecting for me, and itâ€™s worth protecting for everyone else who endeavors in our noble, noble professions. And these kidsâ€¦ And these kids didnâ€™t understand that they were instrumentsâ€¦ instruments of oppression. And I didnâ€™t get mad at them. Theyâ€™re kids. Theyâ€™re freshmen. Theyâ€™re not ready yet. They donâ€™t know.
What made me madâ€¦ and I am this pettyâ€¦ I ainâ€™t sayinâ€™ names. One of the kidâ€™s mother went on Fox News, and she used to be a student here, I remember her face but I donâ€™t know if she was particularly popular. Anyway. She was in the Literary Media Arts department. She said a lot of things that I didnâ€™t like, lot of things. But, you know, thatâ€™s her right. The thing she said that got to me, she said, â€œAt Duke Ellington, that theater was a sanctuary for students. I used to sit there and meditate.â€ Well, of course youâ€™d meditate. You were a Literary Media Arts student. We didnâ€™t meditate in here. We got to work. But, okay, fine. â€œI would sit in there and meditate,â€ she said.
And then she scrunched her face up. Sheâ€™s a beautiful woman, but her face looked hideous, the way she scrunched it up, and she said, â€œAnd just to imagineâ€¦ his nameâ€¦ on that theater. How could you do that to those kids?â€
Listen. No matter what they said about The Closer, it was still the most-watched special in the world. And I am still of the mind, and I say this with all humility, it is a masterpiece, and I challenge all my pâ€“ my peersâ€“ to make its equal. They cannot. I am sure. It will be decades before you ever see someone in my genre as proficient as me. I am maybe a once-in-a-lifetime talent. I am telling you the truth.
About three weeks ago I saw in the newspaper that a man, they said a man that was dressed in womenâ€™s clothing, threw aâ€“ a pie at the Mona Lisa and tried to deface it. Andâ€“ and it made me laugh, â€™cause Iâ€™m like, â€œItâ€™s like The Closer.â€
I said it to the kids that day: if you have a better idea, then express it. And you can beat me. Itâ€™s that easy. If you have more talent than me, then display it and you can beat me with certainty. This is what our genre is about.
The idea that my name will be turned into aâ€“ aâ€“ a instrument of someone elseâ€™s perceived oppression is untenable to me. The fact that if my name was on this theater, and a kid that walked through that door would feel anything other than pride in his school and in their endeavors, thatâ€™s untenable to me.
So on Friday, I decidedâ€¦ that I donâ€™t want my name on the school. Hear me out. The Ellington family is my family. When this controversy came out, and students were angry, at the height of their anger, they said, â€œWe still wanna name the theater after you.â€ They taught the kids about the nuance of art and activism. And toâ€“ I feel a great deal of success, and it came around. So itâ€™s not that they did not wanna give this to me, theyâ€™re still my family. And, Iâ€™m not gonna say I donâ€™t want it. Iâ€™m gonna say Iâ€™ll defer it. Rather than give this theater my name, I would like to give these students my message. To them.
So it is with great honor, that I unveil the new name of this theater, the Jerrod Carmichael Theater. Iâ€™m just kidding, Iâ€™m just kiddinâ€™â€¦ Iâ€™m just kiddinâ€™. Iâ€™m totally joking. Uh, let me see if I can get this here. This theater should be calledâ€¦ The Theater for Artistic Freedom and Expression. I want that for myself, and I want it for every student thatâ€™s educated at this school. And when and if you are ever ready, you can put my name right on top of that.
I love you, Duke Ellington, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to bring off his new album Leace Renewed, the first single â€œFlow to You,â€ give it up for the best-hitter history teacher in the world, Mr. Leace.

â€œI was sitting here,â€ said the judge, â€œin this old pulpit, holding court, and we were trying a big, wicked-looking Spanish desperado for killing the husband of a bright, pretty Mexican woman. It was a lazy summer day, and an awfully long one, and the witnesses were tedious. None of us took any interest in the trial except that nervous, uneasy devil of a Mexican woman because you know how they love and how they hate, and this one had loved her husband with all her might, and now she had boiled it all down into hate, and stood here spitting it at that Spaniard with her eyes; and I tell you she would stir me up, too, with a little of her summer lightning, occasionally. Well, I had my coat off and my heels up, lolling and sweating, and smoking one of those cabbage cigars the San Francisco people used to think were good enough for us in those times; and the lawyers they all had their coats off, and were smoking and whittling, and the witnesses the same, and so was the prisoner. Well, the fact is, there warnâ€™t any interest in a murder trial then, because the fellow was always brought in â€˜not guilty,â€™ the jury expecting him to do as much for them some time; and, although the evidence was straight and square against this Spaniard, we knew we could not convict him without seeming to be rather high-handed and sort of reflecting on every gentleman in the community; for there warnâ€™t any carriages and liveries then, and so the only â€˜styleâ€™ there was, was to keep your private graveyard. But that woman seemed to have her heart set on hanging that Spaniard; and youâ€™d ought to have seen how she would glare on him a minute, and then look up at me in her pleading way, and then turn and for the next five minutes search the juryâ€™s faces, and by and by drop her face in her hands for just a little while as if she was most ready to give up; but out sheâ€™d come again directly, and be as live and anxious as ever. But when the jury announced the verdictâ€“Not Guiltyâ€“and I told the prisoner he was acquitted and free to go, that woman rose up till she appeared to be as tall and grand as a seventy-four-gun ship, and says she:
â€œâ€˜Judge, do I understand you to say that this man is not guilty that murdered my husband without any cause before my own eyes and my little childrenâ€™s, and that all has been done to him that ever justice and the law can do?â€™
â€œâ€˜The same,â€™ says I.
â€œAnd then what do you reckon she did? Why, she turned on that smirking Spanish fool like a wildcat, and out with a â€˜navyâ€™ and shot him dead in open court!â€
â€œThat was spirited, I am willing to admit.â€
â€œWasnâ€™t it, though?â€ said the judge admiringly.
â€œI wouldnâ€™t have missed it for anything. I adjourned court right on the spot, and we put on our coats and went out and took up a collection for her and her cubs, and sent them over the mountains to their friends. Ah, she was a spirited wench!â€

[crowd cheering]
Cleveland, Ohio! Thank you! Thank you so much. This is so great. This is so nice to be here with you in public. Weâ€™re not stuck at home doing this for ten likes. Ah, thatâ€™s right, you danced. You know you did. It was a real blight on American history. No one wants to talk about how they danced, but people danced. Theyâ€™re like, â€œIf I do it enough, itâ€™s my key to financial freedom.â€ â€œI donâ€™t need to read a book.â€ â€œIâ€™ll just do this for ten likes. I hope it works out for me.â€ No! You were never gonna make money dancing on TikTok. You want to know why? Because youâ€™re ugly. Itâ€™s only for, like, 22-year-old smokinâ€™ hot girls. Theyâ€™re like, â€œItâ€™s a skill,â€ and dudeâ€™s finger going now. â€œOh, good job, Chloe.â€ Yeah. It was never gonna be your financial future. We got a whole microgeneration of kids now going for job interviews at, like, Bank of America. â€œIt says here under â€˜special skills, â€˜ â€˜Look up at Travis.'â€ Heâ€™sâ€¦ Nothing? The dancing on TikTok was never sexy independent of the app of TikTok, okay? There is no music in real life, there is no editing. The dancing on TikTok was never sexy independent of the app of TikTok. Gentlemen, that would be very weird for you if you saw one of those dances in the wild. Youâ€™re out at a bar and look over on the dance floor and you see a girl justâ€¦ Youâ€™d be like, â€œOh, no. Hope she gets home okay.â€ The dances on TikTok were never sexy independent of the app of TikTok. Letâ€™s put this into some scene work. Before we get in the scene work, I just want to acknowledge this is my sixth Netflix special, and I built a careerâ€¦
[cheering]
Good night. Iâ€™ve built a career the last five specials talking to people in general, but I always want girls to feel good, to know that Iâ€™m on their side. Yeah, I want you to do well. Yeah. But, boys, that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not on your side. Iâ€™m on no oneâ€™s side. I want everyone to do well. And, boys, I want you to have the information and the wisdom nuggets that girls have, because I believe you are half the problem. So come along, let me teach you. It occurs to me now, Iâ€™m 39. Iâ€™m an elder millennial. Iâ€™m a mother. I have information. I remember dating, why waste all this information? So, this is for the young men in the crowd. Weâ€™re talking 30, younger, okay? The rest of you boys will die set in your ways, okay? For the young one. And the older guys are fine, theyâ€™re like, â€œYeah, come and take it.â€ Okay.
The younger ones, give me your squishy brains and let me help you, okay? Let me give you some pearls of wisdom to make it easier with the girls. So, the dancing on TikTok was never sexy independent of the app of TikTok. Gentlemen, letâ€™s say you get a girl to go home with you. You get a girl to go back to your apartment by the grace of God, and you bring her back. You should know, boys, first of all, you get naked so fast. Youâ€™re like, â€œDo you wanna have sex?â€ The girl agrees, you sign the contract. Itâ€™s all good, NDA, done. She has barely even said, like, â€œOkay,â€ and youâ€™re like, â€œYou ready?â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œIs this Americaâ€™s Got Talent?â€ Like, quick change, naked. Uh-oh. Is that made of Velcro? You get naked so fast, and then itâ€™s uncomfortable because weâ€™re sitting there as women, like, barely taking off our overalls. Like, â€œOh, my God,â€ and you are naked, trying to make us comfortable, like, â€œDid you want a snack?â€ orâ€¦ â€œYou want soup?â€ â€œI have a cup of soup in the car.â€ While we appreciate that, you should know thatâ€™s uncomfortable because thereâ€™s us, half-naked in the corner, nervous. You are hovering over us, naked, trying to give us food. It feels like weâ€™ve been kidnapped. â€œI promise youâ€™re gonna like it here.â€ Okay. Getting naked should be a seductive dance, a back and forth. I take off my blouse, you take off your blouse. I wonder why heâ€™s wearing a blouse, whatever. Back and forth. Instead, girls get nervous. Like, â€œOh, donâ€™t look.â€ â€œI know youâ€™re going to be inside me soon, but donâ€™t look at me naked.â€ He doesnâ€™t care. â€œBut I didnâ€™t shave here.â€ He will rip it out with his teeth, he doesnâ€™t fuckinâ€™ care. Have some confidence.
Men have Sasquatch bodies, and theyâ€™re like, â€œIsnâ€™t it perfection?â€ And weâ€™reâ€¦ sculpted like, â€œIâ€™m hideous! Oh, I didnâ€™t shave my legs!â€ He doesnâ€™t even know you have legs! He loves ya. Now youâ€™re going to get in bed. Gentlemen, this is important. The way in which one gets into the bed, okay? â€˜Tis a dance. When you prepare the bed, it should require multiple gestures of pulling back multiple sheetsss. Ssss! [whooshing] Sheet, top sheet, duvet, duvet cover, comforter, nano-blanket, teddy bear. Multiple. Itâ€™s a workout, not you grabbing a crusty sleeping bag, like, â€œGet it over.â€ â€œWho sprayed this down with Febreze? This is normally in the duck blind.â€ Ohio likes that one. â€œYeah, we go huntinâ€™.â€
And then the way you get into the bed, boys. This is paramount, okay? When you get in bed, it should be a simple motion, itâ€™s justâ€¦ [whoosh] â€¦and then itâ€™sâ€¦ [pop] â€¦and then one leg and then the other, okay? Now, what Iâ€™m about to paint for you is a memory that a lot of women have suppressed, and Iâ€™m gonna say it, and youâ€™re gonna be like, â€œOh, my God, Tom!â€ Like itâ€™sâ€¦ Boys, you get so excited that weâ€™re gonna have sex. The girlâ€™s trying to go to the bathroom, the guyâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ll meet you in bed.â€ And then we see you hop into bed. Never. Donâ€™t get giddy, okay? This is a serious sexual experience. I donâ€™t want to see, â€œIâ€™m Peter Pan!â€ We never want to seeâ€¦ â€œYippity-skippity!â€ We never want to see you fawnlike, like, â€œOh, Iâ€™m dainty,â€ in the bed, okay?
In my life, Iâ€™ve never been naked and had both feet leave the ground. Do you know how big that spider would have to be for me to just forget about physics? That spider would have to have a gun. Like, â€œDance!â€ No! And now Iâ€™m going to say this. This is indelicate, but it bears being said. Gentlemen, when you â€œyippy-skippyâ€ into the bed, you know, youâ€™ve got to clear the mattress so the human body naturally rounds, your spine naturally rounds, and you hunch over to dive in, and Iâ€™m just gonna say it, â€œWe can see your butthole.â€ Donâ€™t want to see that. Thatâ€™s not nice, okay? I just ruined so many rides home tonight. â€œDid you see my butthole?â€ â€œSusan, did you see my asshole? I need to know!â€ Donâ€™t make us see that. Thatâ€™s a lot to reckon with, okay? As it is, weâ€™re fine with your body. We donâ€™t want to seeâ€¦ Itâ€™s too intimate. We donâ€™t even know how much we like you. We donâ€™t even know if weâ€™re going to be together. We already know the sex will most likely be mediocre for the girl. And then if she accidentally gets pregnant, depending on the state, she will be forced to carry that child to term.
[cheering and applause]
Just so weâ€™re clear and itâ€™s on record, fiercely pro-choice. There is no other way to be, and if you want toâ€¦
[cheering]
Oh, yeah. I hope this goes around the world. And if you, for whatever reason your heart desires, you want to keep your baby, that is fine, I want you to keep your baby. Just donâ€™t make that choice for other women, okay? Okay. Okay. Back to the butthole jokes. Soâ€¦ Heâ€™s in bed. He buttholed, he daintied. Heâ€™s in the bed, the girlâ€™s in the bathroom. The premise of this joke, gentlemen, is TikTok dances are not sexual independent of the app of TikTok. The dances are not sexy. It would be weird for you boys. Youâ€™re in your weird bed, and the girl comes out and sheâ€™s fully naked, and sheâ€™s just likeâ€¦ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou look good. Why donâ€™t you get in bed?â€ â€œOh, Iâ€™m going to.â€ â€œBut firstâ€¦ Iâ€™m going to seduce youâ€¦ â€¦with a dance from TikTok!â€ Remember, thereâ€™s no music. There are no filters. Just you guttural breathing to an eight-count, like, â€œOne, two, three, four!â€ Tits swinging like an orangutan. The 20-year-olds are like, â€œThose arenâ€™t the dances.â€ Every guy in here is like, â€œI meanâ€¦ not not hot.â€ â€œYou are a woman breathing in my apartment, soâ€¦ wouldnâ€™t kick you out of bed, just wondered how long you were gonna stay.â€
So I do have a little girl, and I love her more than life itself. One of the weird parts about being pregnant are the mental hurdles. One of them is that you have to accept that youâ€™re going to gain weight, which, if youâ€™re a woman, youâ€™ve been taught thatâ€™s an unforgivable sin, right? Whatever weight you were at 12, youâ€™ve got to spend your life trying to get back to that. Youâ€™re gonna gain weight, youâ€™re gonna need new clothes.
I didnâ€™t buy maternity clothes, I just wore leggings and T-shirts, but you got to get new underwear, new big-girl underwear, thatâ€™s right. And youâ€™ve got to get a new bra. And I will tell you what, that was mentally very difficult. Because a womanâ€™s relationship with her bra, particularly the ugly one, is sacred, all right? Every girl has an ugly bra. Thatâ€™s right, every girl. I believe itâ€™s what unifies every woman on this planet. We all got an ugly bra, and the bigger your boobs are, the uglier that bra is. Thatâ€™s right. Every girlâ€™s got an ugly bra. Itâ€™s the longest relationship youâ€™ve ever been in. She is battle worn. Every man in this crowd is like, â€œI seen that bra.â€ I woke up the other night, bra was looking at me like, â€œGet out of here, motherfucker!â€ People donâ€™t understand our connection to ugly bra. Like, â€œWhy donâ€™t you get rid of her? Sheâ€™s so ugly.â€ And weâ€™re like, â€œâ€˜Cause she does me right and sheâ€™s a hard worker.â€ â€œSheâ€™s loyal.â€ The bigger your boobs are, the uglier that bra is. Thereâ€™s some truth for you, yeah. If youâ€™re working with anything over a C cup, I got you. I know that pain, I know how hideous our bras are, okay? So you are my people. Anythingâ€¦ and I know. People are like, â€œYouâ€™ve got big boobs, is that hard?â€ It fuckinâ€™ is, okay? They gaslight you, thatâ€™s right. Thereâ€™s where all the big tits are, yeah. The world wants you to have giant knockers, and then when you do, they give you no infrastructure to support them. All we want are cute bras. Instead theyâ€™re like, â€œHereâ€™s a Soviet era wind sock.â€ â€œJust strap it on and help plow.â€ â€œJust do it.â€ You never got to wear the cute bras. Remember when you were a teenager? By the way, if you have smaller breasts, an A cup or a B cup, this is size-inclusive, but you donâ€™t know! You donâ€™t know what it was like being friends with you, and your girlfriends are like, â€œLetâ€™s go to the mall.â€ Remember malls? And you go and they say, â€œLetâ€™s go get cute bras at Abercrombie.â€ Remember Abercrombie? And youâ€™d go with them, and theyâ€™re running forward, and youâ€™re carrying around your grown woman divorcÃ©e chest. Like, â€œWait for me!â€ â€œCanâ€™t run, Iâ€™m not wearing two sports bras, Iâ€™m coming.â€
Theyâ€™re all trying on cute bras, playing slap tickle. Youâ€™re just sitting there eating a slice from Sbarro. Likeâ€¦ â€œMy momâ€™s getting me at two. Iâ€™ll just be here.â€ Theyâ€™d have the cutest bras. I always wanted the cute bras. None for you. Theyâ€™d come out cute. â€œLook at this one, itâ€™s made of moose felt. Mmm.â€ â€œMm. So bucolic. Look at this one, itâ€™s got hearts on it.â€ â€œThis oneâ€™s got little kisses on it.â€ â€œIâ€™m a child. Isnâ€™t it so cute?â€ â€œAww! This oneâ€™s got feathers.â€ â€œThis oneâ€™s just two contact lenses and dental floss.â€ â€œBouncy.â€ Not me! Not me and every other big-breasted girl. We were getting hauled into some back-alley discount van where some Eastern European woman named Loretta is gonna hand-fit you, scoop each breast into its own personal hurt locker and jiggle your tits around in front of your mother! Just sitting there. Youâ€™ve never even made out with a boy. Sheâ€™s just grabbing at you like, â€œHow does this feel?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m kind of turned on. I donâ€™t know!â€
Ugly bra comes in one color. And I can only describe it as like a gray beige. Like, if clammy were a color. Like, I donâ€™t know whose skin tone theyâ€™re matching, but itâ€™s offensive. Who looks like that? Itâ€™s like a drowned Caucasian. Itâ€™s justâ€¦ no life to it. And sometimes, to put lipstick on that pig, theyâ€™ll take a thread of the same pukey color and theyâ€™ll sew in a floral scape, like, â€œOh, thank you.â€ â€œYeah, someone brought me flowers. Thank you.â€ â€œOh, a rose, but the death of my self-esteem.â€ â€œThank you so much.â€
Sometimes to gussy it up, theyâ€™ll put a little gold coin here. Who is that for? The guyâ€™s already pumped to be there. What guy takes off her shirt, heâ€™s like, â€œJackpot, yeahâ€? â€œCh-ching!â€ â€œOh, El Dorado. I have riches for my lifetime.â€ I got one ugly bra that had a ruby, a ruby, right here. What the fuck, am I a troll doll? Why? Ugly bra comes in that one color. I think the part that adds insult to injury are the thick straps. â€œThick-ass strap.â€ No girl wants that. No girl wants thick straps. As you get older or if youâ€™re pregnant, you want the support, but when youâ€™re younger, you donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ want that. I want a licorice whip, thatâ€™s it, tiny. Just aâ€¦ [blows] â€¦whisper ofâ€¦ You donâ€™t want the thick straps, and you know what? You look at any magazine, any fashion shoot, and in movies, thereâ€™s all these girls with huge boobs and they Photoshop out the straps. They donâ€™t want you to see that fuckinâ€™ harness holding it all up. They know no one wants to see a model with a backstrap of bacon. They knowâ€¦ Girls in movies, the ingenue, sheâ€™s got big boobs and sheâ€™s running, and itâ€™s always like a tank top, and the tank topâ€™s always falling, right? We like our women half-dressed and distressed. Just like, â€œOh, my God, I dropped everything.â€ â€œIâ€™m such a klutz. Oops. Tank top fall. Mm.â€ â€œOoh, itâ€™s a clove cigarette, Iâ€™m complex. How am I gonnaâ€¦â€ And then the bra strap falls down. â€œMm, Iâ€™m a riddle.â€ â€œOh! I work at a cafÃ© one day a week.â€
In my life, my bra strap has never fallen down. This thing clocks in for a union job at 9 a.m. Works a 12-hour shift as a tension bridge. Itâ€™s not fallen down, okay? If my bra strap fell down, the next thing youâ€™d hear is like, â€œOh, fuck!â€ â€œIâ€™m taking my things and Iâ€™m leaving, thank you.â€ You never see a hot girl, tank top strap falls down, and thereâ€™s just a seat belt. You never see it. Why those straps got to be so thick? In case I need to, what, pull an apple cart to market? I toured Europe and did that joke in Hungary, and they were like, [Hungarian accent] â€œYes, woman needs to help.â€ The hooks are also a nightmare. Multiple hooks, okay? Anything over three hooks is not a bra, it is an ADT interlocking security approach. [imitating static] [robotically] â€œEnter passcode.â€ Nobody wants all those hooks. No girl wants multiple hooks, because after three hooks, itâ€™s not even a bra, itâ€™s a brassiere, and itâ€™s a full approach. Every girl wants a bralette, thatâ€™s what every girl wants. The cute, like, fart of a bra, thatâ€™s what you want. Boys, I know, Iâ€™ve lost you. Youâ€™re like, â€œWhat the fuck is a braletteâ€? â€œWhy is she speaking French?â€
I got you. A bralette is a butterfly burp of an undergarment. Itâ€™s not even a bra, itâ€™s just two hummingbirds, one under each nipple. Just two cat whiskers holding the back together. Itâ€™sâ€¦ [blows] â€¦bralette! Thatâ€™s what that is. Multiple hooks are a nightmare. You could hurt yourself. Why is it that the hardest thing in the world to do is when you get out of the shower and your skin is damp and you connect the hooks hereâ€¦ Help! Shredding your clavicle. â€œSo, why are you in hospice care?â€ â€œWell, I pulled a back muscle putting on my bra, and I think itâ€™s over.â€
Multiple hooks bother me. And I was thinking about it, like, why is this so triggering? And it goes all the way back to being a teenager, like most things, okay? Remember the first time you seriously made out with a boy, Ohio? So, what, 12, I donâ€™t know. Remember the first time? Oh, I can go lower. Yeah, Iâ€™ve played Louisiana, we can go into the single digits. Weâ€™ll put it at a 16. Weâ€™ll put it at a nice, healthy â€œJack & Diane,â€ all-American 16, okay?
The first time you, like, really made out with a boy, right? Youâ€™re making out with him. You know, as the girl, you are harboring that secret. You know the multiple hook situation. You know the Rubikâ€™s Cube of nylon and nickel thatâ€™s back there. Thatâ€™s a fuckinâ€™ cloth LSAT heâ€™s going to have to pass. You know whatâ€™s back there. The boy has no idea, why would he? Heâ€™s never seen a bra before. All he knows is, â€œI caught a big one.â€ Like, heâ€™s just excited. You know heâ€™s going to have to contend with that, and youâ€™re keeping that secret, like a bridge troll guarding a secret. Like, [high-pitched] â€œIf you can solve these riddles threeâ€¦ â€¦naked for you I shall be.â€
And you know itâ€™s back there, and thereâ€™s that moment, thereâ€™s that moment where youâ€™re making out, right? And he pulls away, and youâ€™re like, â€œItâ€™s time.â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œLetâ€™s do it. I need you.â€ â€œI fucking need this, Jeremy.â€ And he puts his head here. He pulls away from kissing so he can look over your back and look down at his work. Of course he has to look at your back, of course he needs his eyes on his paper. He canâ€™t do that for the first time, sight unseenâ€¦ [speaking gibberish] He canâ€™t do that. â€œYippity-skippity.â€
He canâ€™t do that. No man has the natural dexterity of a doll brain surgeon. Why would you be able to intricately have that gorilla grip, to expand, contract? Why would you know? I know, all the lesbians are like, â€œWe figured it out.â€ By the way, gentlemen, we want you to get it. We donâ€™t want you to be embarrassed. No woman worth her salt wants that. We want you to succeed, right? We want you to take off our bras, and by the way, boys, that is your role. That is your job, to take off her bra. And this has nothing to do with feminism or gender roles. It has everything to do with no woman wanting to make this face. [ululates] â€œHow was the date?â€ â€œIt was great and then she flew out of the sunroof.â€ â€œWe were making out in an Ultima.â€
And so thereâ€™s that moment where, like, he pulls away and he puts his head here, but youâ€™ve never made out with a boy, and now youâ€™re just a head floating on his shoulder. Like, â€œWhat do I do?â€ You canâ€™t, like, â€œYou got it, Trey.â€ â€œKeep going, Steven.â€ You canâ€™t say anything, so you start kissing his shoulder, likeâ€¦ â€œYou can do it! I donâ€™t knowâ€¦â€ â€œMy curfewâ€™s in ten minutes.â€ â€œI need to be shirtless in the back of my momâ€™s Maxima. Hurry!â€ And you watch as his little monkey paw goes behind your back. And youâ€™re a young girl, and you donâ€™t know youâ€™re about to come in contact with your first lesson in male fragility. Because the hand goes behind the back, and heâ€™s focused and itâ€™s silent. And then for us girls, the next thing we hear is justâ€¦ [inhales sharply] [low-pitched] â€œMotherfucker!â€ [high-pitched] â€œCalm down.â€
Unnecessary to have so many hooks. Unnecessary. I did that joke in Portugal, and this woman comes up to me after the show, and she was like 5â€™5â€³, and she comes up, this little old lady. There was no security, she just walked right up, and she justâ€¦ She goesâ€¦ [speaking gibberish] I was like, â€œYes? Hello?â€ And she just goes, â€œI have six hook and never tell no one.â€ [whoosh] Iâ€™m like, â€œCatch her, grab her jewel.â€ You donâ€™t need all the hooks, and Iâ€™ll tell you why. When you go home tonight and you take off your bra, youâ€™ll notice only one hook is doing the work. â€˜Cause these things arenâ€™t structurally sound. Itâ€™s that middle hook thatâ€™s been stripped of its paint. The hook and eye are so warped, it looks like God touching man. [groans]
Ugly braâ€™s important. Itâ€™s an important bond. Brought ugly bra on a recent trip, umâ€¦ You know, the world opened in the last year or so, and I think Iâ€™m like a lot of people in that, when you had the chance to take a trip, you were like, â€œWe gotta fuckinâ€™ go.â€ â€œPack the toothbrush, letâ€™s go.â€ So we took, like, a anniversary, post-baby, babymoon, birth-iversary, work is hard, mix it all together, â€œwe never take a vacationâ€ trip. We went to Italy, and Iâ€™m going to admit something that no woman has ever admitted before, here I go. Umâ€¦ we did not have a great vacation, andâ€¦ it was my fault. [gasps]
[applause]
Thank you so much, good night. No, it was my fault. But hereâ€™s why it wasnâ€™t my fault. I donâ€™t know. Are youâ€¦ a person who works? Are you a woman who works? Do you have a family? Do you have a passion in this world? Yeah.
[cheering]
Are you fucking tired? And not just tired from work, tired from living up to the expectations of everybody who comes in contact with you? It is exhausting. We need a break, and weâ€™re always champion, like, â€œOh, keep working,â€ and then itâ€™s a joke when youâ€™re tired, like, â€œOh, my wife doesnâ€™t want to have sex, sheâ€™s tired.â€ Not just tired, she wants to be dead for a week. She wants to be put in a medically induced coma, if, for nothing else, just to get rid of these bags so people stop asking her why she looks so tired.
Yeah, I had just had a baby. I shouldnâ€™t have gone, but I was like, â€œGet it while the gettinâ€™ is good.â€ Body was different, mind was different. Exhausted from work, stressed out. Allergies, feeling nauseous. I think I took too much Ambien. Is anyone regulating this? And we get there, jet-lagged, and I am miserable. And to make it worse, everybody there, all the girls were like 25. â€œFrom Michigan!â€ And they were all, like, [like valley girl] â€œon their honeymoons with their baseball player husbands named Coleton.â€ â€œHey!â€ â€œColeton, come here.â€ â€œIâ€™m flawless. Coleton.â€ â€œBlixly, Brangin, come here.â€ â€œCrackinâ€™, come here.â€
What are we doing with these names, America? Like, why mess with normal names? No one thinks weâ€™re from old-line British money. â€œLike, Huxton.â€ Iâ€™m sorry, are you a hotel lobby? What are these words? â€œBlisten, Blixon, Dasher, Dancer.â€ â€œBraxton, Higgs, Contraction, come here.â€ â€œTinkle, come here, Triscuit. I married a kitten.â€ â€œCome here!â€ â€œTinkle. Iâ€™m in a romper. Letâ€™s take a picture.â€ Romping! Romping with Tinkle. Ruff! Boys, I know, again, I got you. â€œWhat the fuck is a romper?â€ I got you. Let me explain. A romper is a garment made for a toddlerâ€¦
[cheering and applause]
â€¦that, because of our societyâ€™s obsession with infantilizing women, we have convinced grown adult women that they need to wear, okay? Not one woman has ever put on a romper and then said, â€œAnd thereâ€™s so much room in the crotch.â€ I think itâ€™s all a part of a giant plan to keep women down. Like, youâ€™ll have CEOs, mothers, businesswomen walking into meetings, like, â€œThank you for waiting.â€ Just tugging at it. You got to be smart to wear a romper, I hope you know that. You do. Itâ€™s a puzzle. â€˜Cause thereâ€™s only enough cloth to cover one set of genitals adequately. Like, you can cover your nipples, but, Cleveland, your south mouth is out. Okay? Itâ€™s gonna be out. Iâ€™m a woman. When I put on my clothes, I should not have to decide if Iâ€™m going to dress to the left or the right. Theyâ€™re all in rompers having the best time, and all the Italian women were stunning. Olive skin, designer outfits, wearing six-inch heels. Fuckinâ€™ killing it on ancient cobblestone walkways, not missing a beat. Sitting there in fartable Umbros and orthotics, just eating. Iâ€™m just like, â€œItâ€™s called parmesan. Weâ€™ll never see this cheese again.â€ â€œWe should have it now.â€ â€œLoad â€˜er up on my bra, and Iâ€™ll pull it back to the hotel.â€ â€œItâ€™s duty-free if you eat all of it.â€
Those women were so beautiful, and I would just look at them, snorting ham. And I would just be like, â€œYou girls are so beautiful.â€ â€œThis food here is so good. How are you not a thousand pounds?â€ And they would look at me and they would just be likeâ€¦ [blows out emphatically] â€œBecause we smoke cigarette.â€ â€œWe do not eat processed corn for every meal.â€ â€œAmerican, you are disgusty.â€
And she was right. I was disgusty. But not of body, of heart and mind. I was feeling so bad for myself. Then I started to feel bad about how bad I was making myself feel. And if youâ€™re like me, when Iâ€™m in a bad mood, nothing makes me feel better than dragging everyone down. Then I started to get mad at myself because I would look at these beautiful girls, who hadnâ€™t just had a baby, and I would be like, â€œTheyâ€™re making me feel bad about myself.â€
Which is insane, okay? Theyâ€™re not making you feel anything. And itâ€™s okay, itâ€™s okay to look at other women and decide what you like about them that you might want for yourself, okay? And society will label you competitive, a word that we reserve as a positive for male CEOs, male athletes, and men in general, but if a woman makes herself better, â€œSheâ€™s competitive.â€ â€œSit the fuck down.â€ Itâ€™s normal, itâ€™s intelligent. Itâ€™s called fucking adapting. Itâ€™s called evolution. When I look at another girl, itâ€™s not about disdain for her, itâ€™s about looking at her and thinking, â€œWhat about you do I want to try for me?â€
Thatâ€™s what we do. You are constantlyâ€¦ Itâ€™s a goose. You are constantlyâ€¦ okay. You are constantly submarine sonaring yourself off of other women. Thatâ€™s how you improve. Life is not a vacuum. You have to take in everything around you. [imitating sonar emissions] â€œShe has bangs, should I get bangs? Remember the 2000s? Donâ€™t do it.â€ â€œSheâ€™s wearing a mustard jumper. Should Iâ€¦â€ â€œNo, mustard doesnâ€™t look good on white people.â€ â€œLow-rise jeans? No, you just had a baby.â€ â€œHigh-waisted, elder millennial black-denim-till-you-fuckinâ€™-die, sister.â€
Every girl does it. Admit it. Every girl does it. Donâ€™t believe women that are like, â€œI donâ€™t judge other women.â€ Yes, you do, and I judge you for lying about it, howâ€™s that? Itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s okay to even have a bad thought. Donâ€™t share it, donâ€™t be a fuckinâ€™ monster. Every girl does that. You leave your house feeling great. Youâ€™re thriving, right? You just did, like, ten minutes of yoga, mostly Shavasana, but you still did it. You made a recipe for a green matcha oat latte you saw on TikTok. So you did that. And youâ€™re feeling so good, right? You leave your house like, â€œI feel so lean, so good.â€
You see another girl, maybe sheâ€™s not the cutest, right? Maybe she has her own hermit crab shell. Who knows? At least sheâ€™s a homeowner, who knows? You see another girl, and for the quickest of seconds, you judge her. Youâ€™re like, â€œSheâ€™s not too cute.â€ Maybe sheâ€™s not. Maybe sheâ€™s wearing boot-cut jeans and wedges, who knows? Oh, my God, Cleveland, thatâ€™s bad, okay? Weâ€™ll cut that part. You see her andâ€¦ It was bad. But you see another girl, and for the quickest of seconds, youâ€™re just like, â€œOh, sheâ€™s so cute, sheâ€™s trying. Mm.â€ â€œWhy does she bother? I look so good. Oh.â€ And then you turn the corner and see one of those hot girls in the butterfly fart bras, and she looks beautiful even when she cries, and youâ€™re like, â€œWhy do I bother?!â€ [groaning] â€œReturn me to the sea.â€ â€œLet my body break down into fossil fuels that I may fuel the yachts of hotter people.â€
Your partner just wants you to feel good, right? Your husband, your boyfriend, they want you to feel good. They donâ€™t understand the complexity of self-loathing when it comes to being a girl. They donâ€™t understand that everything is attached and nothing is an isolated incident, right? Men are able to compartmentalize, but they are simple. And I envy that. A guy can look at weight gain like an isolated thing. [low-pitched] â€œWell, I gained weight.â€ â€œBetter remedy that with some bigger pants.â€ â€œHere we go.â€ â€œTo the Dillardâ€™s.â€ Not that simple for girls, is it? â€˜Cause when we gain weight, itâ€™s never just about the weight. Is it? No. Itâ€™s attached to many things because everything is everything and itâ€™s all happening at once. â€œI gain weight because I donâ€™t have a work/life balance because I hate my fucking job because I didnâ€™t get the job I wanted because I didnâ€™t go to school because the guy I was dating didnâ€™t encourage me and I always date the wrong men.â€
Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s about. Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s about. We are constantly beating ourselves up as women, and we are constantly feeling bad. And then I started to feel bad about the fact that we feel bad, and I started to think on the fact that we have a mental illness in this country where, as totally normal women, we just feel bad about ourselves, or we just feel gross. At least once a day, if youâ€™re an American woman, you will utter the phrase, out loud or to yourself, â€œI just feel so gross.â€ For what? For sweating? For working out, for not working out? For feeding yourself? For having sex? Okay, that one, I donâ€™t know. He might beâ€¦ They might beâ€¦ To burn off the whole arm. Okay. Itâ€™s easy to stand here and say that. However, counterpoint. You know when youâ€™re eating and you take, like, one extra bite too much and you can feel yourself gain weight because your bra gets tight? You know what Iâ€™m talking about?
[cheering]
I call it â€œthe thickening.â€ And, boys, you need to know about the thickening because so many of our behaviors as women, youâ€™re like, â€œShe just went crazy, everything was fine.â€ No, â€™twas the thickening. Itâ€™s not you. You brought over a nice meal. Itâ€™s not your fault. The girlâ€™s sitting there, â€œIâ€™m having the best time,â€ andâ€¦ Poof! [low-pitched] â€œUh-oh!â€ â€œGet me out of here!â€ And you should know, once the thickening happens, itâ€™s over, and itâ€™s nothing you did. We need to go to a safe space and eat more food, okay? Thatâ€™s what the thickening is. Sheâ€™s not horny. Youâ€™ve got to get her out of there. No womanâ€™s ever been like, â€œI just feel so gross.â€ â€œLetâ€™s fuck it out of me!â€ Itâ€™s over. Give it a beat. I was feeling so bad about myself and so mad at myself and just awful, and my husband looks at me and he goes, â€œWell, I think youâ€™re beautiful.â€
[audience] Aww!
[growling] [low-pitched] â€œItâ€™s not about what you think!â€ â€œItâ€™s between me and her, and she doesnâ€™t even know it!â€ And every night weâ€™d go to bed, I would kiss my husband good night, and I would say, â€œI love you.â€ My husband would say, â€œI love you too.â€ And I would say, â€œOkay.â€ â€œGo to sleep.â€ And heâ€™d roll over and heâ€™d go to bed, and Iâ€™d roll over and stare at the door. Where bra would be hanging. And Iâ€™d look at her and she at me. And Iâ€™d whisper to her. And Iâ€™d say, â€œI love you.â€ And bra would look back at me and sheâ€™d say, [straining voice] â€œLet me die!â€ â€œI served you well.â€ â€œMy cups runneth over.â€ â€œSeriously, you need to go up a band size.â€ And Iâ€™d say, â€œPlease, donâ€™t go.â€ â€œYou could at least wash me!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI need you now more than ever.â€ â€œI can be useful in other ways.â€ â€œYou can carry your jewelry in my cups.â€ â€œI could be stuffed into the shoe to keep its form.â€
It was like the end of The Giving Tree. â€œCut off my straps and make me into a necklace for a village cat.â€ Only been married for four years, but in that short time, I have figured out what marriage is. Notice how everyoneâ€™s silent. All the long-haulers are like, â€œLetâ€™s hear it, missy!â€ Marriage is, every morning for the rest of your life, waking up next to someone and having to hear a full report of how that person slept. And if you donâ€™t act like this information is newâ€¦ â€¦and interesting, you are a monster. My husband does not sleep well. I know my husband does not sleep well because I sleep next to my husband. But part of my wifely duties is, every morning, I must play the part. I must get into character. I wake up, I see him. [exhales sharply] [wavering voice] â€œOh!â€ â€œHow did you sleepâ€¦ â€¦milord?â€ â€œSeems youâ€™ve grown a tail.â€ Then my husband plays his part. â€œWho, me?â€ â€œOhh!â€ â€œNot well.â€ And then Iâ€™m like, â€œOh.â€ â€œThatâ€™s fascinating.â€ â€œHmm. What could we do with this brand-new problem?â€ â€œDo you think you maybe, finally, want to see a medical doctorâ€¦ â€¦before I kill you?!â€
I donâ€™t talk about my husband a ton in my act, but I did that joke for the first time a few weeks ago and he was on tour with me, and I came off-stage, I was like, [apologetically] â€œIs that okay?â€ And my husband was like, â€œNo, itâ€™s great.â€ â€œItâ€™s great, itâ€™s cool.â€ â€œItâ€™s just really cool how only one of us has a microphone.â€ I was like, â€œWhat do you mean?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œLike you never repeat yourself?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat do I repeat?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œHow many times a night do you yell at me to look at the dog?â€ â€œSheâ€™s a dog, and sheâ€™s naked. Look at her!â€ â€œLook atâ€¦ she sleeps between my feet, I see her.â€ â€œShe has tail and mouth.â€ â€œShe has perfect nose-to-mouth ratio, one-to-one, never seen before.â€ â€œSheâ€™s just baby.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou know, we have a real baby.â€ â€œBut this one has four feet!â€ â€œYou can kiss this one deep in the mouth, you will not go to jail.â€
Donâ€™t judge me. My husband has trouble sleeping. I actually have a little bit of trouble going to bed because, I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re like me, but I need to look at TikTok for six to eight hours before Iâ€¦ [high-pitched] Yeah! Oh, itâ€™s my reward. Iâ€™m like, â€œI read a full paragraph of an actual book.â€ [high-pitched] Brrrrr! I will look at anything. I will Clockwork Orange my eyes open, and I will let it feed me conspiracy theories, ancient alien architecture, a Pomeranian in a raincoat, Taiwanese nail art, pizza-making tutorials, a duck walking across a deck. [imitating duck] I will look at lipless pit bulls, I donâ€™t care.
The other day, I watched a thick couple in rural Illinois do a custody exchange in the parking lot of a Hobby Lobbyâ€¦ â€¦to a Jason Derulo song. And I double-tapped for part two. Iâ€¦ watched these two thumbs get out of their matching cherry-red F-250, swap kids, and the dad looks at the camera like heâ€™s hosting American Idol and goes, â€œWeâ€™re divorced but we co-parent. How do we do it?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œProbably a court order, Zeke.â€ Double-tap, part three.
Then I watched them each get back into their truck next to their new spouse, who, letâ€™s be honest, itâ€™s the middle-of-nowhere America, looked identical to the melted vanilla pudding cup they left in the first place. Real lateral trade if you ask me. And then I double-tap for part four, it was a link to their family Etsy store. I bought a bandanna. Shop small, America.
My biggest issue with social media is the commodification of intangible things, right? The commodification of mental health, for example, okay? So, what do I mean by that, America? Well, I mean this. Whatever youâ€™re dealing with, no matter how niche or huge what youâ€™re dealing with is, there is someone who knows exactly what youâ€™re going through. Theyâ€™ve written papers on your issue and gone to school for it. They are called doctors, and I will tell you what, America, after these last few years, those are the only people from whom I would like to hear.
I donâ€™t want your feelings to be facts, Iâ€™m not interested in alternative facts. Iâ€™m not interested in armchair psychology. Iâ€™m not interested in your trauma giving you the qualification to give some sort of medical advice, and donâ€™t be so sure that the person on the other end of that TikTok actually cares about you. Remember, a look is a like, okay? A click is a like is a dollar. This is all being monetized, okay? So just be very careful because you donâ€™t know whoâ€™s over there and what their intentions are. I only want to hear from doctors and scientists. I donâ€™t want to hear from couples who think vanilla essential oils cure autism. I donâ€™t want to hear from anyone whoâ€™s done their own â€œresearch,â€ personal facts, none of that. Because it finds you. You have to be clear about what youâ€™re looking for, it will find you. Youâ€™re looking at those lipless bulldogs, like, â€œBaby needs a kiss on the mouth.â€ And they pop on like, â€œHey there, just dropping in to remind you, make space for Grace.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œWho the fuck is Grace?â€ Get out of here.
Thereâ€™s always some girl named Cheyenne with a dream-catcher tattoo. Like, â€œHey there, just dropping on to remind you you are safe on this page.â€ No shit Iâ€™m safe, Iâ€™m taking a dump in my own home. Get out of here!
Commodification of feminism is another one. To review, feminism is the idea that people should be treated equally. Thatâ€™s it. It shouldnâ€™t be politicized. And I understand that it has the prefix â€œfem,â€ so itâ€™s like â€œugh.â€ But in our third- and fourth-wave feminism, in an attempt to empower women, weâ€™ve decided the best way to do that, to communicate with the masses, is to talk to women like they are fucking idiots. And we use a specific language. Youâ€™ve seen it. Youâ€™ve seen it in gift shops, youâ€™ve seen it on thank-you cards, youâ€™ve seen it on empowerment bags. Youâ€™ve seen this pejorative, infantilized, I call it â€œglitter speak.â€
Youâ€™ve seen it, splayed across RBG totes and â€œMichelle Obama on a unicornâ€ wine bottles. Youâ€™ve seen this language. â€œYes, sassy bitch, sassy A-F, work, queen.â€ â€œYes, girl, twerk it, mama. RosÃ© all day.â€ â€œThiccck with three câ€™s.â€ â€œWorkinâ€™ and twerkinâ€™.â€ â€œNot an entrepreneur, a she-entrepreneur.â€ â€œNot a boss, a boss bitch.â€ â€œâ€˜Cause itâ€™s different than a regular boss, like a boy.â€ â€œBoss bitch, yes, twerk, queen mama, thick raccoon bitch, do-it-all-day, bubble-gum mama thing.â€ â€œYes, queen, work, bitch.â€ â€œSlay all day, mama.â€
They stole this language from Black gay trans drag queens and made it their own to sell you pencil bags. Who is this language good for? I donâ€™t want to be a boss bitch. I donâ€™t want be a bitch. Thatâ€™s not nice. I want to be regular boss. You would be horrified if someone used this language in real life. So I donâ€™t understand why we think itâ€™s okay to just write it on everything. Youâ€™d be horrified, girls, if you were at work and your male boss went up to your male co-worker and was like, â€œTom, good job.â€ â€œKeep it up, cowboy style, oorah,â€ and thenâ€¦ he turned to you and was like, â€œAnd to you, she-bitchâ€¦ keep it up, thiccck-ass glitter queen.â€ â€œYes, mama.â€ â€œWorkinâ€™ and twerkinâ€™ on the weekend.â€ â€œKeep rewriting herstory, not history, right?â€ â€œYou thick, juicy, empowered slut.â€
Who wants that? We like the idea of empowering women. In theory, thatâ€™s a really nice idea, but in practice weâ€™re still uncomfortable with the idea of a strong woman who makes money. We want to promote the idea, like, â€œYes, work, get that money.â€ But when you do, when a woman is a capitalist, itâ€™s like, â€œWell, how are you considering other women and the planet and the animals?â€ â€œWhat are you doing to make sureâ€¦ Have you apologized lately?â€ â€œWhat are you doing to stay humble?â€
We donâ€™t like it when women are capitalists. We love it when men are unabashed and kicking in dicks. You ever see Realtor billboards outside, like in rural areas? Itâ€™s always some jackass in a ten-gallon hat and a gun, just likeâ€¦ [imitating gun cocking] â€œMy name is Dan, and Iâ€™m the number-one Realtor on the south side of town.â€ â€œIâ€™m Cowboy Dan and I will fuck your wife in your condo and sell it back to you with a 30% markup.â€ â€œLetâ€™s do some paperwork.â€ â€œCome on, come here!â€ You never see that! [high-pitched] â€œOh, Vigilante Dan! Oh, take all my money!â€
You never see a woman, like, â€œMy nameâ€™s Vicky, and I got a fat vagina and a pistol, and you can ride this vagina to savings!â€ You never see that. Ever.
And itâ€™s easy for me to stand up here and tell you to be empowered and be strong, but we all know, when youâ€™re a woman, the real world is very scary, and you will be dinged, you will be faulted for failing to not be perfect to everyone all the time. And what breaks my heart is that women canâ€™t carry that strength all the time. And it breaks my heart when girls who really have done nothing get attacked. You go online, you see a girl, maybe sheâ€™s not the prettiest girl, right? And you know it took a lot for her to post a picture. And thereâ€™s always one comment from a private account, â€™cause you know heâ€™s braveâ€¦ This poor girl took everything to post a picture, and itâ€™s something about her weight or her gender or telling her to kill herself. â€œWhy canâ€™t you control yourself, you fat bitch?â€ Why canâ€™t you control your thumbs, motherfucker, and just say nothing to this stranger? Ask any women in your life, you do not have to be famous for people to say vile things to you. Itâ€™s easy, we just say, â€œJust ignore it,â€ but you carry it with you.
By the way, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the gentlemen that are here, because if you buy a ticket to see me, youâ€™re very smart. Youâ€™re a good guy, you are. And I love you. If you donâ€™t know who I am and your girlfriend dragged you here, I have your money. Iâ€™ve got great news for you boys. If youâ€™re ever online and see a girl that you donâ€™t like for whatever reason, you donâ€™t like the shape of her body, the cut of her jib, the size of her tooth, sheâ€™s only got the one, whatever, great news for you, boys, you donâ€™t have to fuck her. Isnâ€™t that great? We donâ€™t have that program set up yet. Thatâ€™s right, you donâ€™t have to fuck her. You donâ€™t have to patronize her business, you donâ€™t have to pay her any mind, you never have to see her again, â€™cause you have the power to take your probably very small finger andâ€¦ [blows] â€¦scroll right on by. Thatâ€™s all you gotta do. Donâ€™t pay your pain forward. I wish that women could speak to men in real life with the impunity with which you speak to us online. Thatâ€™s what I wish, I wish there was a federal holiday every day where I could just tee off, no physical repercussions. I could be walking with a girlfriend, and one of you walk by, and Iâ€™d be like, â€œThat one, Iâ€™m having a bad day.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna go off.â€ And sheâ€™d be like, â€œDonâ€™t do it, you donâ€™t know him.â€ â€œThatâ€™s the whole point of this holiday. Hey!â€ â€œYou, yeah. Itâ€™s thinning up here, we can all tell, fuck you.â€
There is an anger toward women in our world, in our country. You can see it with the current legislation thatâ€™s being written. However, I wrote this joke before all this happened. Lucky for me, hating women is evergreen and so these jokes still work. But there is an anger toward women when they donâ€™t give attention, a sexual experience, love, admiration, a conversation to an absolute stranger, and there can be deadly consequences for it. And thatâ€™s not her fault, but this is what happens.
Now is the portion where I bring it down in order to bring it back up, here we go. That kid that shot up the University of Santa Barbara a couple years agoâ€¦ I know, it is hard to keep them straight, America, but this one was different, because this kid wrote a whole manifesto about how women donâ€™t pay attention to him and donâ€™t sleep with him and this is what they deserve. That guy that shot up that Asian strip mall in Atlanta, he had a whole interview about how women donâ€™t sleep with him and heâ€™s alone and this is what they deserve. So now this next part, Iâ€™m going to be as clear as possible, because this is a Netflix special, so what I say next will be translated into hundreds of languages, and I want to be succinct and I want to be loud and I want to be clear, so here we go.

Gentlemen, if you are not having sex, and weâ€™re not talking a dry spell, weâ€™re not talking youâ€™re a little shy, weâ€™re not talking, â€œYour Aunt Sheila did a number on me, I gotta take a knee.â€ Weâ€™re not talking you swiped right, she had a tail. You didnâ€™t know it till the Awesome Blossom came. We are talking, if you donâ€™t have sexâ€¦ and the narrative of your life is that you are not having sex because women are bitches, women are whores, youâ€™re a nice guy and you deserve betterâ€¦ that is natureâ€™s way of saying you should not be having sex, for you failed to adapt and evolve and there should be no more of your kind. If you canâ€™t figure it out. And I understand, women cheer for that, most men do. Some men are reserved, I get it. Iâ€™m a girl, Iâ€™m not one of you. And you donâ€™t know, â€œI donâ€™t wanna cheer for that.â€ â€œBros before hos, Iâ€™m leaving behind my guys.â€ â€œI canâ€™t do that.â€ Yes, leave them! Leave the diseased portion of your herd that is broken. Theyâ€™re giving you a bad name. We believe you are good. Come with us for snacks and sex and good-looking babies. And, gentlemen, if it still makes you uncomfortable, I get it. It might make you more comfortable to note that I stole that idea from a man named Charles Darwin. You can Wikipedia it, okay? Itâ€™s just evolution and adapting. Because hereâ€™s the truth, boys, it is so easy to get a girl. This is where I lose the women. You were on my side, â€œWeâ€™re outta here.â€
Itâ€™s so easy to get a girl. By virtue of the fact that there are more women than men on this planet, it means the odds are [British accent] ever in your favor, okay? The fact that women are brainwashed into thinking that we lose value as we get older, thatâ€™s not true, but as we get older, our standards arenâ€™t lowered, but they are negotiable. So, you can get in there.
And I know, Iâ€™m supposed to stand here and be like, â€œAll women are fucking treasures,â€ and we are. â€œAll women are She-Diva power bitches, thatâ€™s right.â€ â€œDiamonds in the muff.â€ â€œAll women are delicate, beautiful flowersâ€¦â€ Some are. And some are total armadillos. And, boys, get you an armadillo. You get you a fully loaded armadilly with a CD changer and everything. Get in there. So many girls are like, â€œAm I an armadillo?â€ No. Iâ€™m afraid that when I say that, Iâ€™m gonna see that back door open and Iâ€™m just gonna see a shell and a tail. â€œI did not drive in all the way from Toledo to be toldâ€¦â€
It is so easy to get a girl, gentlemen. All you got to do is show up. Just be good atâ€¦ something. Women love a man with a purpose, even if itâ€™s a dumb one. â€œI love model trains.â€ Like, â€œIâ€™m there.â€ A girlâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t matter. Heâ€™s got a passion, it could be anything. You know what? Even fishing, someone will take you. Some woman will be like, â€œIâ€™ll take him. So, is that a wide-mouth you caught?â€ â€œI can look at your Instagram where youâ€™re holding all of them? I canâ€™t wait.â€ You could be good at anything. You could be smart, thatâ€™s always a plus. You could be rich, obviously, good-looking, good at math. You could be nice. Turns out thatâ€™s attractive. Like, later in life. I know, men donâ€™tâ€¦ â€œI donâ€™t want to be nice, Iâ€™m Rambo!â€ â€œIâ€™m a badass. I donâ€™t want to be nice.â€ â€œNice guys finish last.â€ Yes. But at least they finish. You could be good with computers, you could be funny. â€“ You could, honestlyâ€¦
[bottle rattles]
You could be an alcoholic. You could beâ€¦ Some girls like to party. You can be shy, thatâ€™s kind of cute. You can be nerdy. Some dorkstress. â€œI will roll the eight-sided die with thee.â€ Like, whatever. Honestly, sometimes you could just be tall. Like, for a little while, thatâ€™s enough. You could just be tall. All the 5â€™10â€ guys are like, â€œFuck you, motherfucker, you could be tall.â€ â€œTry me alone, come here!â€ You could just be tall. You see the way girlsâ€™ eyes light up? â€œTell us about your boyfriend.â€ [like valley girl] â€œColeton, okay, well, heâ€™s tall!â€ â€œColeton, stand in the Zoom â€™cause I want my family to see how tall you are, especially my sister, â€™cause sheâ€™s a bitch, come here.â€ â€œStand in the Zoom. Stand next to me.â€ [microphone thuds] [mouthing words] â€œStop it.â€ â€œPut on a fucking towel, stop it.â€ â€œIâ€™m not looking at that, stop it!â€ â€œBecause the whole audience doesnâ€™t realize itâ€™s a dick, stop it!â€
You can get a girl, boys. Magicians have girlfriends. Iâ€™m not even talking like David Blaine, multimillionaire Vegas magician. Weâ€™re talking some guy doing sleight of hand at a bar mitzvah. Heâ€™s got a girl waiting in his Ultima in the parking lot. â€œThatâ€™s my baby!â€ In closing, been married for four years. Iâ€™m 39 years old. We have a beautiful little girl who just turned six months old. And before we had that beautiful little girl, about a year before, we thought we were going to have a baby and we had a miscarriage. And I donâ€™t tell you that to garner sympathy or make anyone sad or bring the room down, Cleveland. I only tell you I had a miscarriage because I have a microphone, and we donâ€™t talk about these things.
[applause]
And Iâ€™m not embarrassed about it. And maybe if we did talk about these things, maybe if we normalized these discussions, maybe if all discussions about womenâ€™s bodies werenâ€™t hidden under a stack of cash, under a Bible, under a federal building, maybeâ€¦
[cheering]
If this happens to you, because it happens to three out of every ten women, itâ€™s not that it would take the sting out of it, but you would know youâ€™re part of a large group. You did nothing wrong. Youâ€™re not weird. Youâ€™re not bad. You certainly shouldnâ€™t be prosecuted for it.
[cheering]
And youâ€™ll be okay. But it wasnâ€™t until I got pregnant that first time that I became personally in tune with how often women are asked about children. Prior to that, no one had ever asked me about children because Iâ€™m a stand-up comic. â€œWell, youâ€™ll just die in a clown suit somewhere on a regional flight, wonâ€™t you?â€ But I realize how often people ask women about this, I didnâ€™t get that before. Now, itâ€™s totally normal and innocuous to ask a woman, â€œDo you have kids?â€ Itâ€™s an okay thing to ask because weâ€™ll call it traditional. Someone had kids, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re all in this room. Itâ€™s totally traditional for two humans regardless of gender to put their bodies together and then, through means of sex, science, or tradeâ€¦ â€¦acquire smaller humans that they then put in their home and then subsequently put to work. Okay. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s done. Itâ€™s a little less traditional to be like, â€œWeâ€™re in a throuple and this is our tortoise.â€
But okay. However, you ask a woman, â€œDo you have kids?â€ and she says no, if she doesnâ€™t continue that conversation, thatâ€™s not her in need of prompting. â€œDo you want kids?â€ She has her answer, she was just drawing a boundary. Thereâ€™s no more information. We have to be okay with that. She has her answer and sheâ€™s thought a lot about it, and itâ€™s personal to her, and that answer is somewhere in the realm of, â€œYes, we do have kids.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re weird-looking.â€ â€œYes, we want them, weâ€™re working on it, weâ€™re fucking real hard.â€ â€œWeâ€™re not sure, itâ€™s expensive, somethingâ€™s wrong with me.â€ â€œMore likely something wrong with him, we donâ€™t know.â€ â€œUnclear, futureâ€™s uncertain, come back later,â€ or, â€œFuck no, we love our tortoise.â€
Whatever the answer is. Whatever the answer, I promise you her answer is never that she forgot and thank God she ran into you at the dry cleanerâ€™s. Because, Cleveland, I think it speaks to the constant conversations about women, rarely to our betterment, often to our detriment, and the misinformation and disinformation about vaginas, okay? Remember, thereâ€™s a lot of people making a lot of money off of you feeling bad about whatâ€™s normal about you, okay? We donâ€™t have to make this political, we already did, but we can keep this social. Weâ€™ll keep it in pop culture, right?
Weâ€™ll talk about all the things that we hear about this idea that sheâ€™s gotta keep it tight, right? â€œA loose womanâ€? You gotta keep it tight? Letâ€™s put this to rest. â€˜Tis tight! Itâ€™s tight. I understand if sheâ€™s had several children, it may not be that tight, but chances are, if sheâ€™s had several children, a tight vagina ainâ€™t at the top of her priority list, okay? Itâ€™s tight enough. Work your pelvic core for your own health. But letâ€™s put it this way, gentlemen. Itâ€™s tight enough for you and your five inches of fury, okay? Which is plenty. Whatâ€™s with making women feel so insecure? How tight do you need it, boys? Are you fucking a dolphin blowhole? Youâ€™re fine. All right? Youâ€™re gonna have a good time.
This idea that it tastes like candy. No candy! No candy for you! Itâ€™s a vagina, itâ€™s a body part, okay? At its finest, it might be, what, a little metallic? I donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ know. Why would it taste like candy? What other part of your body are you like, â€œThat is Rippleâ€? Like, itâ€™s notâ€¦ Girls are gonna feel bad that it doesnâ€™t taste like candy, and you shouldnâ€™t make it taste like candy, youâ€™re gonna make it sick. Thatâ€™s a problem. Makes girls feel bad. If he comes up from down there, like, â€œGreen apple Jolly Rancher,â€ you better call an ambulance. Something went wrong.
Then finally, this idea, the stigma, that you have to keep it clean. No! The vagina is self-cleaning. Okay? Leave it alone. Yeah, thereâ€™s a small chance youâ€™re sick and you have to see a doctor, but for the most part, it is clean. You know what isnâ€™t clean? Your penis. Yeah. I see you put it anywhere just for funsies, yeah. Donâ€™t be tracking that through my house. Yeah. Okay? Itâ€™s clean. You donâ€™t need to do anything to it. It has its own ecosystem, okay? You donâ€™t need to clean it. You donâ€™t need to put a Glade plug-in, okay? You donâ€™t need to steam it, Gwyneth! You donâ€™t need to vacuum it. Itâ€™s not the back seat of a Mazda. Itâ€™s clean! Okay? The vagina is its own ecosystem. The vagina has its own pH balance. Thatâ€™s why it has its own smell and its own temperature. Your vagina, Cleveland, is like a rain forest in that it is dangerous, it could kill you, it is damp, and it needs government protection. Thank you so much for coming out tonight.

[man] Can you please state your name? Martin Moreno. But you might know me asâ€¦ Martinnnnn! Iâ€™ve been touring with Gabriel Iglesias for 20-plus years. Martinnnnn! And, yeah, heâ€™s been screaming my name for 20-plus years. Hurry up, Martinnnnn! Dude, thatâ€™s better than most marriages. Thatâ€™s a win. It has been an incredible journey. Weâ€™ve gone from garages, clubs, living rooms, to theaters, arenas around the world, and now a stadium. They say comedy is subjective, but when youâ€™re selling out stadiums, thatâ€™s no longer subjective. So, what can people expect? One of the biggest shows Los Angeles has ever seen. And whatever you do, make sure you stick around till the end. You want to see how this thing ends. So, what else is left to say? Without further ado, live from Dodger Stadium, Gabriel Iglesias!

[crowd chanting â€œFluffy!â€]
We did it. I didnâ€™t do it, we did it. Thank you so much. Thank you so veryâ€¦
[in Spanish] â€œThey want to cry.â€ â€œYes, they want to cry.â€ I havenâ€™t been out here 30 seconds and alreadyâ€¦ Thank you so much. Thank you. I know some of you just found out Martin is real. â€˜Cause you finally get to see him, right? And if youâ€™re Mexican, yes, he looks like Machete. Or Marco Antonio SolÃ­s. If youâ€™re white, he looks like the Big Lebowski. Wow! This is awesome. Martin wasnâ€™t lying, you guys. We started off in freaking garages and backyard barbecues and quinceaÃ±eras and weddings andâ€¦ now itâ€™s like, you know, this isâ€¦ this is home for us. The biggest thing Iâ€™ve ever done will be tonight without a shadow of a doubt. And Iâ€™m glad that you can all be here for this. This is, uhâ€¦ â€˜Cause, yeah, after Covid, I wasnâ€™t sure what was gonna happen. You know what Iâ€™m saying?
Like, the only good thing I can say about 2020 for me was the fact that, for some reason, I managed to lose 70 pounds. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I lost 70 pounds. People ask me, â€œWhatâ€™s your secret?â€
I said, â€œItâ€™s no secret, they closed all the goddamn restaurants, thatâ€™s the secret.â€
I didnâ€™t know how to cook. That was the secret. It was me at home with a Foreman Grill making wieniesâ€¦ But, yeah, we were on tour in Kalamazoo, Michigan, when we got the news that we had to go home. And then we came home, and we all turned on our TVs. And we watched them lie to us. Iâ€™m not trying to be a conspiracy person, but they told us, remember?
â€œItâ€™s only going to be two weeks.â€
Thatâ€™s it, they told us, two weeks. Right? â€œLadies and gentlemen, weâ€™d just like to ask that you go home for two weeks, be with your loved ones, be with your family, just two weeks, while we figure things out.â€ â€œDr. Anthony Fauci has given us some new information to go by.â€ â€œJust two weeks, thatâ€™s all we need, just two weeks.â€
And I apologize for using the same stereotypical old white voice. But thatâ€™s the one that they used. Because thatâ€™s the one we listen to in a time of crisis. It couldnâ€™t be any other voice. It couldnâ€™t beâ€¦
[in Spanish and English] â€œNo, man, shut up, look!â€ â€œNo more than two weeks, okay?â€ â€œYou gonna go home, go to your mama and your papa.â€ â€œAnd if Covid come to the house, you tell Covid, â€˜Hey, heâ€™s not here, buddy.'â€ â€œCome back another time, itâ€™s okay.â€ â€œJust two weeks.â€ It couldnâ€™t be any other voice. It couldnâ€™t beâ€¦
[as redneck] â€œIâ€™ll tell you what, this is what youâ€™re gonna do, God damn it.â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna take your ass home, youâ€™re gonna hunker down.â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna hunker down and if Covid shows up at your front door, get her done right there to the face, okay, thatâ€™s what youâ€™re gonna do.â€ â€œJust two weeks.â€ It couldnâ€™t be any other voice. It couldnâ€™t beâ€¦
[as Black man] â€œAll right, listen up, this is whatâ€™s gonna happen.â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna go home, youâ€™re gonna be with your family and them, right?â€ â€œAnd ifâ€¦â€ oh, you donâ€™t wanna laugh at the Black voice, huh? Whatever. Thatâ€™s your guilt, not my guilt, Iâ€™m fine. Iâ€™m fine. But, yeah, just two weeks, thatâ€™s what they told us. Two weeks, and two weeks turned into two months, turned into half a year, turned into a year-plus. And little by little, they told us who was most at risk for Covid-19. Come to find out, itâ€™s people over 45, okay? People who are overweight. Here we go. Diabetics.
[in Spanish] No fucking way, really? Most at risk, Latinos and African Americans. Yeah. Bye, Felicia. I come to find out I was 85% of the underlying conditions. Over 45, overweight, diabetic, high cholesterol, high blood pressure. Apparently Covid is my Tinder match. Someone finally wants to swipe right, and her name is Corona. Yeah. The mask thing is still a thing. Some are for it, some are not. Some, you know, some places itâ€™s required, some places itâ€™s optional. Biggest complaint I have heard about the mask is that the mask smells funny. And Iâ€™m here to tell you, no, it doesnâ€™t. You do. You are smelling what everyone has been telling you all these years, and finally youâ€™re smoking what weâ€™ve been smoking. Oh, yeah. Iâ€™ll be honest with you, my mask smells delicious. My mask smells like Oreos and tres leches cake, okay? If you smell my mask right now, you will Krispy Kreme yourself, itâ€™s so good. I feel like selling it on the OnlyFans website to see if I can make some money. Some of you know whatâ€™s up?
[in Spanish] You skank. This next thing Iâ€™m going to say is in no way, shape or form political. So, please, donâ€™t take it that way. The vaccine. Look at some of you, â€œOh, here we go.â€ â€œHere we go, I knew it was coming.â€ â€œI knew it.â€ â€œLook at him, heâ€™s got â€˜boosterâ€™ written all over him.â€
Iâ€™m not here to tell you what to do with your bodies, Iâ€™m just here to share a story. I got vaccinated, okay, and Iâ€™m not saying it to get approval. Iâ€™m just telling you because, hey, look, I was 85% of the underlying conditions. At this point, Iâ€™m rolling the dice. Plus, I wanted to work. I got the vaccine, but it was one of those things where, you know, in the beginning, when you wanted to get the vaccine, you couldnâ€™t just walk into a CVS. You had to make an appointment. You know, and it was a drive-out, you couldnâ€™t just show up. â€˜Cause I tried. Oh, I tried using the face.
Iâ€™m like, â€œEh, hey, eh!â€ Apparently this only works at Red Lobster. Oh, yeah, I could show up at Red Lobster at eight oâ€™clock on a Saturday, itâ€™s on. â€œDo you have reservations?â€ â€œItâ€™s Fluffy, make biscuits!â€ But for the vaccine, no, I made my appointment like everyone else. It was a drive-out location, you know.
[imitates car revving, tires screeching]
Thereâ€™s a little speaker box. â€œMay I help you?â€ This is very familiar. â€œYeah, let me haveâ€¦ a large vaccine.â€ â€œPfizer/Moderna?â€ â€œUh, I got a coupon.â€ â€œWhateverâ€™s free.â€ â€œPull up to the window.â€ Then I pull up to the next window. And then a guy whoâ€™s all covered up, heâ€™s got the whole, you knowâ€¦
[breathing loudly]
Then you give him your arm, and then they harpoon you. And they make you park your car for 10 to 15 minutes in case you have an allergic reaction. So Iâ€™m sitting in the car and I got the radio going and the A/C going, and I glance over and I notice thereâ€™s people there protesting. And thatâ€™s fine. Protesting is a right, and Iâ€™m all for it, okay? My problem is when protesters leave the sidewalk and get right in your face. So hereâ€™s what happened. I glance over, I see the protestors, and I locked eyes with one of them. And I could do this all day, Iâ€™m in the car.
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat?â€
The lady who Iâ€™m looking at all of a sudden starts walking towards me.
And Iâ€™m like, â€œAh, shit.â€
She gets to my car and she starts going off on me. And I have never had a complete stranger go off on me for no reason at all. She gets to the car and sheâ€™s like, â€œYou are so stupid! You are so stupid!â€ â€œHow could you get the vaccine? How could you get the vaccine?â€ â€œYou have no idea what you just put inside your body, dumb ass.â€
I didnâ€™t know what to say. I was like, â€œBitch, I eat chorizo.â€ You have no idea what that vaccine has to work through in order to have any type of effect whatsoever. Itâ€™s got to go through yearsâ€™ worth of chorizo, chicharrÃ³n, carnitas, carne asada, freakinâ€™ hot dogs, bologna, Spam, menudo, caldo de res. Itâ€™s gotta go through the gauntlet. But, yeah, so, on top of that, you know, weâ€™re trying to figure out this whole thing with Netflix and doing a new special. And during the pandemic, 2020 especially, there was not even a possibility of assembling a few people, much less a stadium.
So, Netflix made it clear. â€œWe need a new special sooner than later, okay?â€ This was right beforeâ€¦ They didnâ€™t have Squid Games yet. You rememberâ€¦
[chanting Squid Games melody]
[in falsetto] â€œRed light!â€ Some of you are like, â€œThatâ€™s racist.â€ No, thatâ€™s accurate, thatâ€™s really good. So anyway, Netflix said, â€œAs soon as thereâ€™s an opportunity to record a new special, we need a special.â€ So, with time going by, there became two options for recording a special in late 2020. One was Florida and the other was Texas.
[scattered booing]
Some people from Texas cheering, yeah? Okay, you can cheer all you want. Thatâ€™s where I got Covid. Yeah.
[in Spanish] Fucking slacker. Soâ€¦ So, hereâ€™s the story. So, I had done shows before in Texas, and I had never done a show in San Antonio, so the original plan was, we wanted to record a special in San Antonio for the new Netflix show, you know, for the series. So, we couldnâ€™t really travel too much.
And remember they kept telling us, â€œStay in your Covid bubble.â€ â€œDonâ€™t forget to stay in your bubble,â€ so, in order to be as proactive and just careful, we all went out there together as a team, okay, and then we all basically said, â€œWeâ€™re going to do a residency in San Antonio for 30 days.â€ â€œThirty shows in 30 days, and on the last day, weâ€™ll record a new special.â€ This way gives me a chance to start performing again because it had been over a year since I touched a stage. And so we get there and they gave me the option, â€œDo you want to stay in a house or do you want to stay in a hotel?â€
And I said, â€œWell, Iâ€™ve never lived in Texas before, so letâ€™s see what a house feels like.â€ So they got us, like, this fancy Airbnb, and basically, you know, it was Martin, Alfred, my friend Rick, myself, it was four of us. It was like the Mexican version of The Real World, okay? So, weâ€™re all in this big house together. Everyone gets their own room, and so, of course, I get the big room â€™cause itâ€™s me. Andâ€¦ you know. Look at some of you, â€œNo!â€ Yes! So I open up the door, I turn on the lightâ€¦ click! And Iâ€™m like, â€œThis is a beautiful room.â€ â€œWow! Look how big it is.â€
And then I notice thereâ€™s a hole in the wall. I said, â€œThatâ€™s weird.â€ So I get really close to the wall, and when I got close, I realized itâ€™s not a hole, itâ€™s a big-ass roach. And let me tell you, I am not exaggerating when I tell you that cuca was this big. That roach was this big. Now, I have used this unit of measure before to exaggerate, and Iâ€™m not exaggerating when I tell you that freakinâ€™ cucaracha was this big.
And I donâ€™t want you guys thinking, â€œYou think youâ€™re too good for roaches?â€ No! I grew up with roaches my whole life. My mom and I, we lived in apartment buildings, projects. We always had roaches, but they were different. First of all, they were this big. And California roaches are very different, okay? For example, when you turn on the light, they scatter. In Texas, he chilled. In California, they respond to sound and movement. â€œHaaaa!â€ â€œScatter!â€
I tried my California technique on this Tejano roach. I said, â€œHaaaa!â€ And the roach was like, â€œWhat?â€ Oh, my God, I donâ€™t think heâ€™s in my room, I think Iâ€™m in his. And at that moment, my tour manager walks in the room, and sheâ€™s like, â€œIs everything okay with the accommodations?â€ I said, â€œNo, the room is beautiful, but, um, look at the wall.â€ â€œAw, thereâ€™s a hole in the wall!â€ I said, â€œGet closer.â€ She gets up to the wall and sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, itâ€™s a big-ass roach.â€
I said, â€œYouâ€™re okay with that?â€ She said, â€œHeâ€™s not in my room.â€ She can see that Iâ€™m visibly bothered by this roach, so sheâ€™s like, â€œWould you like me to take care of your little friend for you?â€ And it is a little emasculating, because Iâ€™m a big guy and sheâ€™s like 5â€² 2â€³. So sheâ€™s like, â€œMove, fool.â€ She takes off her shoe, she grabs it, she gets up on a chair, and she brings it back and sheâ€™s like, â™ª Soy la 69 â™ª Bam! Nailed that roach. Threw down her shoe, put it on. I look at the wall, and it kept moving. And I said, â€œYou have angered our friend.â€ And she was defensive. â€œUh-uh, fool, round two!â€
So she grabs her shoe, gets back up on the stool, and she brings it back, and just as sheâ€™s about to nail this roach for the second timeâ€¦ that shit started flying. It was a Harry Potter roach! Oh, man, look, look, look! Sheâ€™s Ã±aÃ±aras, man. So anyway, we were there for 27 days. And for some reason, on the 27th day, out of a team of 30 people that were there to film a special, I was the only one that tested positive for Covid-19. No one else got it. Not Martin, not Alfred, nobody.
And I told Martin, â€œDude, I donâ€™t know where I got it.â€ And he said, â€œI think you got it from the roach.â€ Anyway, on top of dealing with Covidâ€¦ and, by the way, a sincere apology to the city of San Antonio because I was supposed to tape a special with you guys, and clearly for obvious reasons we couldnâ€™t do it. But I hope you understand why I had to do this tonight.
[cheering]
On top of dealing with Covid, the vaccine situation, I come to find out someone was trying to extort money from me. Yeah, and they werenâ€™t even family.
[in Spanish] So, suck it. Watch. I get a phone call from my manager telling me that someone reached out claiming to have video footage of me being â€œinappropriateâ€ with models. Yeah, see? Look at â€™em. You guys are like me. Yeah, Iâ€™m like, â€œI need to see it too.â€ Now, no disrespect to any woman who has ever given me the opportunity. But none of them were models. Maybe a couple of cochinas from West Covina, maybe. But they were not models. They were just good citizens. Thank you. So, anyway, they said I had until 9 a.m. to make a deposit of $50,000 into an account or they were going to release the footage to TMZ and my career was going to be over. When I got the message, it was already 6 p.m. So I had missed the deadline by half a day. So I was like, â€œLet me turn on the TV, see if I still got a job.â€
And clearly this is the first time you guys are hearing about this because there was no footage. They were just trying to scare me into giving them money. The only reason why Iâ€™m telling you the story is becauseâ€¦ only 50,000? Like, seriously? Thatâ€™s what my career is worth? Donâ€™t get me wrong, when I said $50,000, some of you were like, â€œOh!â€ And it is a lot of money, but if youâ€™re going to go after a celebrity, $50,000 is really low. Like, to put it into perspective, they did the same thing to Kevin Hart. And with Kevin Hart, they hit him for ten million. Ten million. Which lets me know where I stand on the comedy totem pole of success. Thereâ€™s Kevin Hart with ten million, and I am like the Groupon of extortion. â€œWhereâ€™d you get your extortion?â€ â€œGot that shit at Ross on clearance.â€
Fifty thousand dollars. You canâ€™t even buy an Escalade with $50,000. That is like a Hyundai Sonata at best, okay? And thatâ€™s like a base model. You still gotta do this shit to the window, you know? Fifty thousand dollars? Butâ€¦ on a more happier note, I did manage to stay busy during the pandemic. I did a movie from my living room. Yeah. And it wasnâ€™t even on Pornhub. The movie already came out in theaters. It was called Space Jam, itâ€™s the movie with LeBron. Los Angeles, you are looking at the new voice of Speedy Gonzales.
[cheering]
Thank you. I found it ironic that they hired the slowest Mexican to play the fastest, you know? And two weeks after I get this part, I come to find out that theyâ€™re trying to cancel Speedy Gonzales. Iâ€™m sure some of you heard that they came after two cartoons. They came after PepÃ© Le Pew and Speedy. Now, PepÃ© I understand. Heâ€™s a little touchy. You know, but he disguises it with a â€œOh-oh, mon chÃ©ri.â€ â€œOh-oh-oh!â€ â€œMon chÃ©ri. Oh-lah-oh-ohhh!â€
Yeah. But Speedy Gonzales, whatâ€™s his crime? Heâ€™s Mexican and heâ€™s fast. That is not a crime. In Montebello, thatâ€™s called job security. So I said, â€œI cannot let them hurt Speedy,â€ you know. â€œI canâ€™t let them cancel him.â€ So I came to his defense. Plus, it was my only job. I went to the only place I felt I could go to protect him. I went on Twitter. And Twitter, ooh, Twitterâ€™s a scary place. It is. You only go there to fight, to get into it, to prove a point, and so a friend of mine said, â€œIf you want to get some attention, use a hashtag,â€ and so I did. And I wrote a tweet that said, â€œHey #cancelculture.â€ â€œMy name is Gabriel Iglesias, and Iâ€™m the new voice of Speedy Gonzales.â€ â€œYou cannot cancel or catch me.â€
And I posted it. I had no idea that when you go on Twitter looking for problems, you will find them. Oh, yeah. Every major news outlet picked up my tweet and used it in a story about cancel culture. ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN. If I would have known that, I would have used spellcheck. â€˜Cause my family called.
[in Spanish] â€œWhat, are you stupid? Spell correctly!â€ Oh, my God. Even Fox News did a story with my tweet. Fox News. You know how I know? My bus driver Dave called me. Oh, he was thrilled. He was like, â€œFluffy, God damn it, Iâ€™ve never been prouder.â€ â€œYou made it, baby. Youâ€™re on Fox News.â€ I said, â€œDave, shut up, youâ€™re stupid.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œAmerica.â€ Even Warner Bros. Pictures reached out to say thank you, and before I know it, I was on a Zoom call. And I know a lot of us had to get used to Zoom, and itâ€™s kind of convenient, right? All they see is this. So to entertain myself, every time I took a Zoom call, I was full Winnie the Pooh. And if youâ€™re not laughing now, you better ask someone who is, â€™cause there is no coming back from full Winnie the Pooh. I was leaving baby powder all over the house. It looked like an episode of Narcos. So I get on the Zoom call with the director, writer and producer of Space Jam. And theyâ€™re being super nice, super supportive, super cool. Theyâ€™re like, â€œGabriel, thank you so much for lending your voice talents to our film.â€ â€œWe really appreciate you being part of this.â€ â€œIf you have any questions or concerns, let us know.â€ So, â€œThank you.â€ â€œWe have a question for you.â€ I said, â€œOkay.â€ â€œHow do you feel about the voice of Speedy Gonzales?â€
I said, â€œWell, what do you mean?â€ â€œWell, you know, some people find him to be a little stereotypical.â€ â€œWhat are your thoughts?â€ I said, â€œWell, you have not met my family.â€ I cannot speak for all brown people, but I can tell you that me personally in my house growing up, Speedy Gonzales was not viewed in a negative way. As a matter of fact, he was the only form of representation we had growing up. It was him and the little bumblebee on The Simpsons. â€œGabriel, we were thinking that perhaps you would like to lend your real speaking voice to the character?â€ â€œMaybe modernize him a little, you know, bring him up to speed.â€ I said, â€œWell, you know, with all due respect, I appreciate the fact that you would give me the power to change the sound of such an iconic character, but at the end of the day, when people see the movie, I donâ€™t want them to think of me, I want them to think of Speedy Gonzales.â€ So I said, â€œPlease keep his voice original.â€ And then he asked the question, â€œWell, do you think you can do the voice?â€
How did I get the part? Now, remember, I never auditioned for Speedy Gonzales, they just called me. And I assumed that they knew that I did voices for a living and that I could pull this off. So I says, â€œWhat made you choose me if you didnâ€™t know whether or not I could do theâ€¦â€ â€œOh.â€ â€œYou needed a big brown shield in case shit happened, huh?â€ And then all three people on the phone call were likeâ€¦ I said, â€œWell, donâ€™t worry â€™cause with me you get a twofer.â€ â€œYou get an actual Mexican and you get someone that can nail the voice.â€
Soâ€¦ oh, yeah. Thatâ€™s right. So, before I know it, this sound person, the guy who does recordings over at Warner Bros., gets on the call. The only thing I know about this guy is that heâ€™s loud, okay?
He gets on the call, heâ€™s like, â€œGabriel Iglesias, how are you?â€ Wow! â€œHowâ€™s it going?â€ â€œMy nameâ€™s Steven, the sound coordinator at Warner Bros. Pictures.â€ â€œSo hereâ€™s whatâ€™s gonna happen.â€ â€œBasically, Iâ€™m gonna hit â€˜record, â€˜ and as soon as I hit â€˜record, â€˜ I just need for you to start talking like Speedy Gonzales.â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna get the flow, the tempo, the timing, and as soon as we got it dialed in, weâ€™re gonna make a movie.â€ â€œSound good?â€ â€œSounds good.â€ â€œThis is Gabriel Iglesias for Space Jam: A New Legacy, Speedy Gonzales, take one.â€ â€œGabriel, mic check, 1, 2, 3.â€ â€œ1, 2, 3.â€ â€œSounds good, here we go.â€ â€œAndâ€¦ go.â€
All right, here we go. â€œHola, amigos, my name is Speedy Gonzales, the fastest mouse in all Mexico.â€ â€œÂ¡Arriba! Â¡Epa, epa, Ã¡ndale!â€
The director, writer and producer, all three were likeâ€¦ â€œThat was perfect!â€ I said, â€œI know, Iâ€™ve been Mexican a long time.â€ And I said, â€œAnd donâ€™t just think that just because Iâ€™m Mexican, I can only play the Mexican character.â€ I said, â€œI do voices for a living.â€ â€œIf given the opportunity, I could voice the entire film all by myself.â€ I could. Watch. Marvin the Martian. â€œOh, my, oh, my modulator.â€ Yosemite Sam. â€œI hate that rabbit!â€ Bugs Bunny. â€œEh, whatâ€™s up, Doc?â€
I said, â€œYou can fire all the other voice actors right now. I will do the whole movie for half plus medical insurance.â€
And it was the middle of 2020, so I meant that shit. Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, no co-pay, no co-pay.â€ My favorite part about this was the fact that they actually entertained the conversation. Like, he could have just looked at me and said, â€œYouâ€™re stupid.â€
And I would have accepted that. I would have been like, â€œOkay,â€ you know? But I guess weâ€™re living in different times where people are a lot more sensitive and more mindful, and so he just wanted to make sure I was okay, so heâ€™s like, â€œGabriel, I am not taking anything away from your credibility as a voice talent, as an entertainer, as just an individual, but my hands are tied.â€ â€œContracts have been signed, checks have been cut.â€ â€œThis was a union project,â€ and Iâ€™m like, â€œLook at him go!â€
The producer is also on this call, and the producer is the one responsible for the finance, the money. So he hears the director just freakinâ€™ goinâ€™ down, and heâ€™s like, â€œWhoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.â€ â€œHear the man out.â€ â€œGabriel.â€ â€œFluffy.â€ â€œBaby!â€ â€œTalk to me, puddinâ€™.â€ â€œIf we can make this happen, what are we talkinâ€™?â€ I said, â€œWhat do you mean?â€ â€œWell, what are we talkinâ€™? Whatâ€™s your rate, whatâ€™s your fee?â€
I said, â€œWell, word on the street is I go for no less than 50,000.â€ â€œAnd I do have emails to support that.â€
They still said no, but whatever. I know Iâ€™m going to have to defend Speedy Gonzales again at some point, because unfortunately thatâ€™s how cancel culture works. You know? And donâ€™t get me wrong. I understand that some people need to be held accountable, butâ€¦ And by the way, if Iâ€™m the one telling you about cancel culture, itâ€™s already gone way too far. Because I pride myself in the fact that Iâ€™m not a comedian whoâ€™s divisive. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t talk about politics, religion or sports, okay? Because all three will divide people. Thatâ€™s why I talk about food. Because food brings people together. Thatâ€™s right. Unless youâ€™re vegan. In which case, you can leave right now. I donâ€™t give a shit. I donâ€™t care if I offend you and your salad, you can leave. Bye. And the only reason why Iâ€™m so â€œughâ€ on the vegans is because I once was vegan. I know, some of you are like, â€œNo!â€
Yeah. I was vegan for a little under a year. Some of you are probably thinking, â€œYou werenâ€™t vegan, then, if it was less than a year.â€ But think about it. Anyone who has ever gone on a diet knows just how hard it is to change your eating habits for one week, much less a year. And they told me, they said, â€œYouâ€™re going to lose weight.â€ And they were not lying. I lost weight, patience and friends. So Iâ€™m just here to let you know, Iâ€™m back.
[bellows like cow]
Soâ€¦ I almost got canceled. I almost got canceled because I posted a tweet of one of my dogs. Now, some of you already know I have two Chihuahuas. Yeah. People watching at home are like, â€œThatâ€™s not stereotypical.â€ Yeah, I know. I have two Chihuahuas. I have a little boy dog named Vinnie and a little girl dog named Risa. Combined weight, 14 pounds. My little girl dog Risa, she is 4 pounds, and sheâ€™s 17 years old. Yeah. Her anger keeps her alive. I will confirm every stereotype about Chihuahuas. Oh, yeah, itâ€™s real. The rage is real. But with me, she loves me, okay? Sheâ€™s 17, she has no teeth. Her tongue hangs out. Sheâ€™s adorable.
So I posted a picture of her on Twitter with the caption that basically read, â€œGoing to take my little nugget to go get some chicken nuggets.â€ And then I tagged â€œ@Chick-fil-A.â€ Okay, so, yeah, you feel that? See how the majority of the room was like, â€œThat place is goodâ€? â€œSucks theyâ€™re closed on Sunday.â€
And then there was a few of you in here and you heard the groanâ€¦ Yeah. Half of those people, vegans. The other half are the ones that blew up my Twitter feed. My Twitter feed started getting flooded with nasty comments. â€œYouâ€™re stupid, youâ€™re horrible. How could you? We thought more of you.â€ â€œReally, Fluffy, you?â€
And I donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about. The problem with cancel culture is they only attack, they donâ€™t educate. They donâ€™t explain. They just attack, and they expect you to know better or understand them, but theyâ€™re not willing to play nice. So hereâ€™s what happens. Iâ€™m asking questions, no one wants to answer. â€œFluffy, youâ€™re horrible.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat do you mean?â€ â€œReally? Chick-fil-A?â€ Iâ€™m sorry, Popeyes was closed, I donâ€™t know what to tell you. â€œYou know what youâ€™re doing.â€ I am more hungry than woke. I donâ€™t know what you mean. And then finally someone took the time to explain to me why I was â€œwrongâ€ for that tweet. Come to find out that Chick-fil-A in the past has been known to make contributions to organizations that are a little out of line with the LGBTQ+ community. Now, forgive me for using my hand to get the letters right. I just wanna get the letters right. I do consider myself a supporter and an ally, and Iâ€™m trying my best to be as understanding as I can beâ€¦ â€¦with the limited information I have available. Now, Iâ€™m gonna say it again. Iâ€™m trying to be as understanding as I can be with the limited information I have available, which basically means I only read headlines. Hereâ€™s the thing, you guys. There are a million struggles in this world. Every single day there are people trying to better their lives, trying to get to a goal, trying to achieve something to get them out of one place and into something better. And itâ€™s impossible to keep up with everyoneâ€™s fight unless you mess up, and then someone pulls you aside and reads you the riot act. So, hereâ€™s how the conversation went. â€˜Cause I finally got one. They said, â€œWell, Gabriel, if you consider yourself a supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, moving forward will you still be tagging Chick-fil-A in future posts?â€ I said, um, â€œYes, I will, but itâ€™s not because Iâ€™m not a supporter.â€ â€œIâ€™m definitely a supporter of your cause, but causes are a two-way street.â€ â€œYou gotta support mine too.â€ I said, â€œI tagged Chick-fil-A for the same reason I tag every other company I use organically.â€ â€œIâ€™m trying to get free shit.â€ Plain and simple, donâ€™t look past it. And I know some of you are like, â€œWell, Gabriel, donâ€™t you make money?â€ Yes, I do, and you know how you keep it? Free shit. Yeah, let me tell you how I discovered this one. So, I was at a Chipotle one night, and the staff was incredible.
So I wanted to give them a little shout-out online.
So I gave them a shout-out and then I tagged â€œChipotle.â€ Chipotle saw my tweet and then they reached out to me to say thank you, and to show their appreciation, Chipotle mailed me a burrito card, good for one yearâ€™s worth of unlimited Chipotle. And I tested it. Oh, they gave it to the wrong person. After about two weeks, it looked like a Metro card. It was all scratched up. So now, let me tell you guys, if you were me and you sent out one tweet that got you fed for a whole year for free, wouldnâ€™t you be tagging as many companies as you could to see who else would want to donate to the cause? The only thing Iâ€™m guilty of is hoâ€™ing myself out, thatâ€™s it. I was being a little cyber skank, thatâ€™s all I was doing. But again I understand that some people need to be held accountable for certain actions. I just feel like a lot of times a simple conversation can fix things. I know that based on todayâ€™s rules, I can be canceled right now for previous comedy specials that Iâ€™ve done over the years. And I understand that, so Iâ€™m just waiting for the call. I know I can be canceled for previous comedy specials. And I know they probably expect me to apologize, but I would never apologize for my previous work because, you know what, it was perfectly acceptable at the time. Clearly there are things I would change now, but thereâ€™s no way to go back and apologize for that when everything was okay. I want to let you all know right now that there are things about me that you donâ€™t know that youâ€™re gonna find out sooner than later. So basically what Iâ€™m trying to do at this moment is do what my lawyer said and â€œget ahead of it.â€ I offended someone whose name I should have never brought up. I offended a professional fighter. His name is Canelo. I know. Go big or go home. If you are not familiar with who Canelo is, give me a few seconds to explain. Canelo is arguably one of the best fighters in the world. Okay? You cannot miss him. He is, in fact, Mexican, but he does not look traditional. Canelo is, in fact, the whitest Mexican on Earth. Heâ€™s super white. Heâ€™s so white, heâ€™s redhead. Canelo is a redheaded white Mexican fighter. He is so white, even Donald Trump was like, â€œYou can come.â€ Super white. But then he opens his mouth and you realize, â€œOh, Canelo, heâ€™s not local.â€ So hereâ€™s how I got in trouble. A comedy friend of mine by the name of Ron White reached out to me. And Ron White invited me to be part of his tribute to the troops comedy show for the national network. And I told Ron, â€œIâ€™d love to do the show. Anything for the troops. Letâ€™s do this.â€ So the show taped in Vegas, and itâ€™s a couple of comics plus myself, and Ron Whiteâ€™s the host. He brings me up onstage, and I figure Iâ€™m only doing ten minutes, okay? I might as well just do references to Las Vegas since everybody knows Vegas, so I started talking about boxing. And then I brought up Canelo. And hereâ€™s where I got in trouble. I said, â€œCanelo is my favorite fighter of all time.â€ â€œI just wishâ€¦â€ And it was all downhill after that. I said, â€œI just wish he would not do interviews in English, because English is not his strong language, and if youâ€™re a professional fightâ€¦â€ Hear me out. If youâ€™re a professional fighter, you need to sound confident, engaged, threatening, aggressive, on point, in your face. And in Spanish, he does. In English, not so much. In Spanish, heâ€™s a killer. In Spanish, the reporter, the announcer comes outâ€¦
[in Spanish]
â€œWeâ€™re here with Canelo Ãlvarez, whoâ€™ll be fighting Floyd â€˜Moneyâ€™ Mayweather this coming weekend on pay-per-view at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada.â€ I know some of you heard that right now and youâ€™re like, â€œOh, my God, I think I understand Spanish.â€ â€˜Cause you do. So then the reporter will look at Canelo and ask him about the fight.
[in Spanish] â€œCanelo, what will be your fighting approach?â€ Canelo takes the microphone. Heâ€™s a man of few words, but heâ€™s on point. He looks at the camera and heâ€™s like, [in Spanish] â€œLook, Iâ€™m gonna punch him like this and like this.â€ â€œIâ€™ll knock him to the ground and, boom!â€ â€œSo donâ€™t miss the fight this weekend at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, Canelo Ãlvarez vs. Floyd â€˜Moneyâ€™ Mayweather.â€ â€œDonâ€™t miss out!â€ Same exact interview. English. â€œIâ€™m standing here alongside Mexican superstar SaÃºl Canelo Ãlvarez, whoâ€™s going to be facing Floyd â€˜Moneyâ€™ Mayweather this weekend on pay-per-view.â€ â€œCanelo, what is your strategy and your plan of attack going into this weekendâ€™s fight against such a technical opponent, if you will, a man who has single-handedly redefined the sport of boxing?â€ â€œWhat is your plan of attack going into the fight?â€ â€œUhâ€¦â€ â€œWellâ€¦ Iâ€¦ am going to hit him like this.â€ â€œIâ€™m going to hit him like this.â€ â€œHe going toâ€¦ fall on theâ€¦â€ â€œHow do you say piso?â€ â€œFloor? He going to fall to the floor and thenâ€¦ asÃ­.â€ â€œAll right, well, there you have it.â€ â€œFloyd Mayweather, I hope you are ready, my friend, because, yeah, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s waiting for you.â€ â€œReporting live for ESPN News, Iâ€™m Phil Stevens.â€ â€œBack to you in the studio, and weâ€™re out.â€ â€œWhat the hell was that, God damn it?!â€ â€œWhy didnâ€™t you warn me?â€ So word gets back to Team Canelo about the joke that I did. I find out because I have friends in the boxing community who reached out to tell me, â€œBro, what happened?â€ I said, â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ â€œDude, we heard.â€ â€œHeard what?â€ â€œWe heard that Team Caneloâ€™s pissed.â€ I said, â€œSo, what does that have to do with me?â€ â€œWell, I guess itâ€™s about a joke you did about Canelo?â€ â€œHuh?â€ â€œWho showed him?â€ If I would have known one of the best fighters in the world was going to see me do a joke about him, I would have never done a joke about him. I didnâ€™t think heâ€™d ever see Ron Whiteâ€™s tribute to the troops comedy show on the national network. I didnâ€™t think he was ever gonna see it. Shit was in English. Now Iâ€™m worried about the confrontation because I know itâ€™s only a matter of time. And I know where heâ€™s going to confront me. Itâ€™s gonna happen in Vegas. And the reason why Iâ€™m so confident that itâ€™s going to happen there is because when I perform in Vegas, I perform for MGM Grand Properties. And so I get free tickets to the fights. And I always go â€™cause itâ€™s free! And they put me ringside so that my face comes out on the jumbotron to help me sell tickets.
So I know â€™cause Iâ€™ve seen Canelo fights before ringside, Iâ€™ve never spoken to him, but I know thatâ€™s where itâ€™s gonna happen. And Iâ€™m nervous about this confrontation, because I didnâ€™t know if heâ€™s going to confront me in English or Spanish. I hope itâ€™s in Spanish â€™cause I want to feel the fear, you know what Iâ€™m saying? I hope, you know, heâ€™s like, [in Spanish] â€œIâ€™m going to kill you, fucking fat man!â€ Iâ€™m just worried he might, you knowâ€¦ â€œHey!â€ â€œHey, jou.â€ â€œHey, jou, fat bitch mother Fluffy.â€ â€œHe just called me â€˜fat bitch mother Fluffy!'â€ So, if anything happens to meâ€¦ Canelo. But I guess I should feel honored at the fact that someone at his level would even acknowledge a comedian. You know, it feels good at least knowing that he knows who I am, which is nice. It at least makes me feel relevant. Because, you know, after 2019, I wasnâ€™t sure what was gonna happen. Honestly, for me, I thought that 2019 was the best year I ever had in comedy. And the reason why I say this is because I was this close to hosting the Oscars. Yeah. Pretty sure I got a good chance next year. The year that I almost got to host, that was the year that Kevin Hart was supposed to host. I donâ€™t know if you remember the story, but basically, Kevin Hart was supposed to host the Oscars, and any time you host, the background check is next level, okay? They go through all of your social media, all the way back to Myspace. People over 40, you know whatâ€™s up. Come to find out that ten years ago, Kevin Hart had sent out a couple of tweets that were questionable, so the academy confronted Kevin Hart about the tweets. And they said, â€œKevin, can you please explain?â€ And Kevin was like, â€œYes, I said those things.â€ â€œI acknowledged them ten years ago and I apologized ten years ago.â€ â€œCan we move forward?â€ And the academy was like, â€œWell, good, Kevin, weâ€™re glad that you apologized because theyâ€™ve been brought to our attention again and we need for this to go away, so we need you to apologize.â€ And Kevin said, â€œYou canâ€™t make me apologize twice for the same thing ten years apart.â€ And they said, â€œWell, you have to, because if you donâ€™t, you cannot host the Oscars.â€ And Kevin said, â€œWell, thank you, but no, thank you.â€ And he walked away from the job. I would have done the same thing in his position. Because by him apologizing, he gives more power to cancel culture, and we canâ€™t give them more, we gotta take it back. Soâ€¦ nowâ€¦ So, now the academy was left with a problemâ€¦ trying to find a suitable replacement for Kevin Hart, which is not an easy thing to do. So they reached out to a bunch of actors to see if there was interest, and everyone said the same thing: â€œThank you, but no, thank you.â€ â€œWe want no part of that Kevin Hart drama.â€ No one wanted the job. Me, on the other handâ€¦ Oh, I recognize a job opening when I see one.
So I had my manager call the academy, and the academy was thrilled to hear from anyone. They were like, â€œGabriel Iglesias, yes, we know who he is.â€ â€œHeâ€™s very funny, very witty.â€ â€œWe think he would make a good host for the Oscars.â€ â€œPlease have him submit some comedy material so we can see what the vibe of the night would be, and based on the material, weâ€™ll make our choice.â€ So, thatâ€™s what I did. I sat down one night, got a pen, piece of paper, wrote out a bunch of jokes, and I turned them into the Oscars. And I think thatâ€™s why they said no. It never made it to TV. So tonightâ€¦
[cheering]
Tonight, I would like to do the opening joke that I was going to do for the Oscars. And then you can decide what the vibe of the night would have been. All right. Let me do the voice.
[clears throat]
â€œGood evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Academy Awards.â€ â€œHereâ€™s tonightâ€™s host, comedian-funnyman Gabriel Iglesias.â€ â€œThank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.â€ â€œThank you, it is an honor.â€ â€œThank you. Thank you.â€ â€œIt is an honor to be here tonight hosting the Oscars.â€ â€œIn keeping with tradition, here is another Mexican doing a job nobody else wanted.â€ And they passed. They passed. Yeah. You know, and then getting back into the swing of things, we have definitely come a long way from 2020. The fact that weâ€™re in a sold-out stadium, elbow to elbow, ready to laugh. Have fun. Weâ€™ve come a long way. You know? 2020, you guys, I gotta just thank my dogs. I gotta thank my dogs â€™cause my dogs kept me sane, they kept me happy, they kept me focused. â€˜Cause I was so depressed, I was sad, I didnâ€™t know what to make of things. Do we have any dog owners?
[cheering]
Yeah? See, dog owners, you know whatâ€™s up. No other animal in the world will give you 100% like a dog. What? Cat? No. Iâ€™m sorry, no disrespect to cats or cat owners, but cat owners, you know as well as I do, your catsâ€¦ â€™cause I know you got more than oneâ€¦ your cats look at you like you live in their house. You walk in, you try to scold them for somethingâ€¦
[purrs]
Then when you try to talk to them, they turn their back and show you their butthole. Youâ€™re staring like, â€œOh, my God, itâ€™s so dark!â€ Only a dog will give you 100% of itself. Thatâ€™s why they get so sad when they know youâ€™re about to leave and why they get so happy when you come home. You are literally everything theyâ€™ve been looking forward to. â€œAnd now youâ€™re back!â€ I know for a fact nothing on this planet loves me more than my dogs. I said this last night, and someone said, â€œWhat about your son?â€ I said, â€œNothing loves me more.â€ I could leave my dressing room for one minute or for one hour. When I come back, the reaction is the same. It is the greatest moment ever, every single time. Oh, yeah, my dog Vinnie will jump off the couch and run towards me top speed, and then when he gets to me, he jumps up and down, and he makes a sound likeâ€¦
[imitates Chihuahua]
You can almost hear, â€œWhere were you? Where were you? Where were you?â€ And he pees everywhere. I used to get upset that he would do that, but then I thought about it. My dog loves me so much, he cannot control his own bodily functions. Thatâ€™s why, when I would go home, I would immediately pick him up before anything. And then my girlfriend would get mad. â€œHow come you donâ€™t come to me first?â€ I said, â€œBecause the dog loves me more.â€ â€œHow do you know I donâ€™t love you more?â€ I said, â€œI donâ€™t see a puddle.â€ Mira. Dry. Yeah, she didnâ€™t like that. Sorry. But, yeah, these dogs, man. Let me tell you. And I apologize if Iâ€™m kind of stuttering or Iâ€™m not as focused right now. I have never been distracted by a blimp with my face on it.
[cheering and applause]
Iâ€™m sorry, Netflix, but, shit, thisâ€¦ This is like a birthday and Christmas and the Super Bowl and the World Series and losing my virginity all at the same time. [chuckles]
[crowd chanting â€œFluffy!â€]
Oh!
â™ª Even saw the lights Of the Goodyear Blimp â™ª
[laughing]
Iâ€™m sorry, you guys, Iâ€™m just so goddamn happy right now, thank you.
[cheering]
I wish my mom were here to see this. You have no idea. She would have been happy to see all of you, but she would have been like, [in Spanish] â€œFuck off.â€ â€œLook, whatâ€¦ my son is in heaven, heâ€™s with Jesus in the sky, you see?â€ That is amazing. Some of you guys okay? I heard a cough over there. You all right? Donâ€™t cough, they just let us come back. I would rather you fart than cough. If you feel another one of those coming, just hold your face, convert the energy, and blow it out the back, all right? And I know the people behind you are like, â€œDonâ€™t do that!â€ You let it rip, and if the people behind you canâ€™t smell it, then they got Covid. Okay, thatâ€™s a free home test. Anywayâ€¦ So during 2020, my dogs and I, the most normal thing we could do was just take a drive, okay? Drives, you could just get in the car. Nothing was open, but you could take a drive, and so we get in the car.
[imitates doors closing, engine revving]
I put on this playlist and just drive. Eventually, we went out looking for food. And I know that sounds crazy to say it that way, but remember, 85% of the underlying conditions. I never once set foot in a market because I was afraid. All of my food came from friends and street vendors. Yeah. Yes, I support street vendors in case anyoneâ€™s wondering.
[cheering]
â€˜Cause no matter what, theyâ€™re working their asses off, again, trying to make a better life for themselves and for their families. After leaving a taco stand one night, I realized that a lot of people needed to step out of their comfort zones in order to find alternative ways of making ends meet. I made the mistake one night of assuming the guy working the stand was Mexican.
[in falsetto] He wasnâ€™t. I even spoke Spanish to him, which is a no-no. The rule is, when engaging a brown person, you must speak English to them first, and then if thereâ€™s a language barrier, then you go to plan B high-school Spanish. You start off in English. â€œHello, sir, may Iâ€¦â€
[in Spanish] â€œI donâ€™t understand.â€
[in English] â€œOh, hold on, I got this.â€ â€œHola.â€ â€œYo meâ€¦â€
So I walked up to this guy at the stand and I was like, you know, he reminded me of a tÃ­o, so I was likeâ€¦
[speaking Spanish] Which is like, â€œHello, friend, how are you?â€ And he responded, [Greek accent] â€œWhat are you saying to me?â€ â€œIâ€™m sorry, sir, I thought you were Mexican.â€ â€œNo, no, I am not Mexican. I am Greek.â€ Greek? Shit, I was way off. â€œIâ€™m sorry, brah, itâ€™s late, Iâ€™m tired. Can I have two tacos?â€ â€œWhat you mean, â€˜Can I have two tacos?'â€ â€œI just finish tell you, I am not Mexican, I am Greek.â€ â€œI do not sell taco.â€ â€œI sell yee-roh.â€ â€œYee-roh?â€ And then I remember seeing writing on the front of the car, and I just thought it was the guyâ€™s name or something, right? Iâ€™m like, it spells it out: G-Y-R-O. â€œGyro!â€ He got all pissy. â€œIt is not a gyro, itâ€™s a yee-roh.â€ â€œThat shit says â€˜gyro.'â€ â€œIt is yee-roh!â€ â€œBro, Iâ€™m tired, itâ€™s late.â€ â€œWhat is a â€˜yee-roh'â€? â€œItâ€™s like a taco.â€ â€œGimme two.â€ Eventually businesses started opening their doors and allowing us to go back inside, and Iâ€™ll tell you guys right now, my big, guilty pleasure is Starbucks, okay? Thatâ€™s my guilty pleasure, Iâ€™m all about a Starbucks drive-thru. But the difference is, when you have the option of going inside versus drive-thru, thatâ€™s one thing, but when they tell you you canâ€™t go inside anymore and then they tell you you can, you kind of miss it. Like me, I couldnâ€™t wait to go back inside when they said the doors are opening up. I couldnâ€™t wait to go in and order from a counter and talk to a person and look at a menu. I didnâ€™t mind. I showed up early.
[imitates engine revving, tires screeching]
Got my dogs with me, I didnâ€™t care. We walk into Starbucks. And I know they did this over in Long Beach. Iâ€™m not sure if they did this here, but they put stickers on the floor. And so there I am standing on this freakinâ€™ sticker. I got my dogs, just chillinâ€™. Standing there looking like a third grader. Weâ€™re just chillinâ€™, waitinâ€™. And some lady behind me notices that Iâ€™m holding two dogs. She clearly had an issue with the fact that I was holding two dogs, and instead of saying, â€œPardon me, excuse me, hey there, hi, hola,â€ she does the wholeâ€¦
[clearing throat] Iâ€™m hearing this and Iâ€™m like, â€œShit! Covid!â€ â€œI donâ€™t see any stickers!â€ â€œIâ€™m off the grid!â€ And she was like, â€œI do not have Covid.â€ â€œAre those service dogs?â€ â€œTheyâ€™re Chihuahuas.â€ â€œAnd these, in particular, are the complete opposite of service dogs.â€ â€œWell, are they supposed to be inside?â€ I say, â€œYou know, I didnâ€™t ask.â€ â€œI didnâ€™t want to leave them in the car.â€ â€œIâ€™m not staying, Iâ€™m going to order my drinks and leave.â€ â€œIâ€™m not even going to put them down. Iâ€™m sorry.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œWell, are they at least legal?â€ Youâ€™re gonna ask a Mexican if his dogs are legal? Fortunatelyâ€¦ â€œNext in line.â€ â€œThank God.â€
So I get to the front, and now Iâ€™m worried, because the lady has me thinking in the back of my head that Iâ€™m doing something bad, that Iâ€™m about to get scolded or kicked out.
So Iâ€™m trying not to make eye contact with the guy.
So Iâ€™m just looking at the menu, and I hear him, â€œDogs.â€ â€œHi, bro, sorry about that. Sorry, sorry, I know.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re adorable!â€ â€œWhat are their names?â€ â€œOh! Well, this is Vinnie, this is Risa.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re so cute.â€ â€œThank you.â€ Then here comes another barista, and sheâ€™s like, â€œI see dogs!â€ â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re adorable.â€ â€œWhat are their names?â€ I was like, â€œOh, well, this is Vinnie, this is Risa.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re too cute.â€ â€œThank you.â€
So I placed my order, and then the girl barista, she goesâ€¦ â€œYes?â€ â€œYou know, I gotta tell you something about your dogs, right?â€ â€œI know, Iâ€™m sorry, I just didnâ€™t want to leave them in the car.â€ â€œWhat are the little ones gonna have?â€ â€œWellâ€¦ as much as I would love to share my coffee with my dogs, I donâ€™t think caffeine and Chihuahuas mix.â€ â€œNo, silly.â€ â€œMaybe your little puppies would like a Puppucciâ€¦â€ Okay, you see that shit? Now youâ€™re vocal. When I talked about stickers, â€œWe donâ€™t know nothinâ€™ about stickers, pero un pinche Puppuccino, all freakinâ€™ day,â€ right? Sorry. Anywayâ€¦ When she said â€œPuppuccino,â€ I was like, â€œWhat kind of a drink is it?â€
Iâ€™m looking at the menu like, â€œI donâ€™t see that shit anywhere.â€ â€œNo, silly, a Puppuccino is just a little cup, and we put whipped cream in the cup.â€ â€œThis way, you can enjoy your beverage and your little ones can enjoy something with you.â€ I said, â€œOh, my God.â€ â€œI love this.â€ â€œHow much are they?â€ â€œOh, theyâ€™re free.â€ â€œTell me more.â€ â€œYou have two little puppies so you get two free Puppuccinos.â€ â€œOh, my God, can I have a third one?â€ â€œOh, is there another little puppy weâ€™re missing?â€
This one. I was so excited, I told her, â€œDo you understand how happy you just made me with this whole Puppuccino thing?â€ â€œOh, yeah.â€ â€œThey let it be known that if anyone ever shows up with a dog, always offer them a Puppuccino on the house.â€ â€œSo, itâ€™s cool that I walked in with my dogs?â€ â€œOh, yeah, theyâ€™re welcome any time.â€
Iâ€™ll just tell you guys right now, I am very petty. I am so petty, I was like, â€œCan you say that louder?â€ â€œYour puppies are welcome any time!â€ Iâ€™m not gonna lie, I felt a little bit like Canelo. I did, I couldnâ€™t help it. I turned around, I was like, â€œEh, you hear that, bitch mother?â€
[womanâ€™s voice] â€œI was there the night Fluffy got fired.â€ Like I said, no matter what you say or do, someoneâ€™s gonna find a way to twist things and make it bad. Iâ€™ve already gotten an email over the fact that I did that joke aboutâ€¦ that nothing on this planet loves me more than my dogs, versus my son. Someone already reached out, like, â€œHow devastating for your son.â€
Iâ€™m like, he knows! I love him very much. My son is going on 25 years now. Heâ€™s 24 years old. Frankie is 24 years old. Thank you for clapping, heâ€™s still at the house. I did an interview recently and someone was asking me questions about my son. They said, â€œYou know, Gabriel, youâ€™ve always mentioned your son in your specials.â€ â€œCan we look forward to a new story coming out?â€ And I said, â€œNot really a new story so much asâ€¦â€
â€˜Cause my son is doing his own thing now. Heâ€™s doing his own thing, heâ€™s got his own life, and thatâ€™s awesome. I do however still have stories from the past that I never told, and he goes, â€œWell, do tell.â€ I said, â€œOkay, my favorite story is actually probably the first one.â€ â€œIn 2007, when I first got himâ€¦â€ Some of you know heâ€™s technically my stepson, but Iâ€™ve never liked saying â€œstepson.â€
He is my son, yeah.
[cheering]
He is my son or my aftermarket child. No gray area. Anyway, itâ€™s 2007, and for some reason, Iâ€™m home on Halloween. Now, hereâ€™s the thing. As a comedian, I have signed up to perform 365 days a year. There is no sacred day for me. I work on Christmas day. I work on New Yearâ€™s Eve, Valentineâ€™s Day, St. Patrickâ€™s Day, birthdays, holidays, special occasions, no matter what. My mom told me, [in Spanish] â€œIf you have a job, you have to work.â€
You gotta work, especially if you got a good job. You donâ€™t want no one to take it, so if youâ€™re going to go for it, give it everything. So the fact that Iâ€™m not working on Halloween is super rare. And so my sonâ€™s mom is likeâ€¦ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI think this is so cool that youâ€™re home today.â€ â€œYou know, since this is Frankieâ€™s first year where itâ€™s just the three of us, how about this?â€ â€œHow about tonight you take him trick-or-treating and Iâ€™ll stay home and give out candy?â€ â€œThis way, it will give the two of you the opportunity to get to know each other, have some conversations, have some laughs.â€ â€œWhat do you think?â€
I said, â€œBaby, you know what, thatâ€™s a great idea.â€ â€œI love it, I love it.â€ â€œOkay, Iâ€™m on it. Frankie! Come on, weâ€™re going trick-or-treating.â€ â€œWhat about my mom?â€ â€œSheâ€™s gonna stay home.â€ â€œYay!â€ So we get in the car.
[imitates doors closing, engine revving]
And I take Frankie to â€œthat neighborhood.â€ You know what Iâ€™m saying. That neighborhood that gives out the Costco candies. Yeah. So we park the car and we start going up the street. And Iâ€™m not wearing a costume, Iâ€™m there for him. So heâ€™s dressed up for Halloween, Iâ€™m just me. So some of the doors we knocked on, the people freaked out. One guy was likeâ€¦ â€œThe Fluffy!â€ I was like, â€œOh, my God, Iâ€™ve never been referred to as â€˜The Fluffy.'â€ I didnâ€™t know what to say. â€œIt is I.â€
[humming epic tune]
One door we knocked on, they opened the door, they were like, â€œOh, my God, youâ€™re famous!â€ I was likeâ€¦ We go all the way up, cross the street, come all the way back. By the time we get to the car, the bucket is overflowing with candy. Okay? So we get back to the house, and it hasnâ€™t even been an hour. We walk in, and Frankieâ€™s mom is pissed. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat the hell is this?â€ I go, â€œWhat?â€ â€œI thought I told you to take him trick-or-treating.â€
I go, â€œI did. Like, show the score.â€ â€œThe whole point of you taking him trick-or-treating wasnâ€™t to get candy.â€ â€œThe hell you say.â€ â€œWhat was the point?â€ â€œThe point was for the two of you to spend time together, have some laughs, have some conversations, get to know one another.â€ â€œYouâ€™re not going to do that in an hour.â€ â€œCan you please, for me, take him out one more time for at least an hour?â€ â€œBaby, I get it, donâ€™t even worry about it, I got it.â€
So I said, â€œFrankie, come on. Dump out your bucket. Round two.â€ So we go outside, we get in the carâ€¦
[imitates doors, engine]
I donâ€™t want to go door-to-door again, so I say, â€œI got an idea.â€ I take Frankie to Walmart. We get to Walmart, and Frankie goes, â€œWhat are we doing here?â€ â€œI got it, watch.â€
We walk in, I said, â€œGrab a cart.â€ â€œFollow me.â€ And I lead Frankie all the way to the candy section. As soon as we get to the candy section, I stop the cart. And I got in Frankieâ€™s face and I said, â€œFrankie, you have exactly 30 seconds to grab as much candy as you can.â€ â€œReady? Go!â€
And he froze. I said, â€œDude, clockâ€™s ticking, move.â€ â€œOh, my God!â€ So he grabs a bag, looks at it, throws it in the cart. Grabs a second bag, looks at it, throws it in the cart. Grabs a third bag, and on the third bagâ€¦ â€œTime!â€ And it was the first time I heard him go, â€œShit!â€
â€˜Cause he knew he wasted that golden opportunity, those first few seconds. So we get to the car, I rip open the three bags, I dump them out in his bucket, and I tell him, â€œLook, Frankie, when we get home, you cannot tell your mom that we went to Walmart.â€ â€œWhy not?â€ â€œBecause sheâ€™s gonna say that we cheated trick-or-treating.â€ â€œBut itâ€™s better.â€ â€œI know itâ€™s better.â€
So we get home, and of course now itâ€™s a different tone. Sheâ€™s like, â€œThere you are. Did you guys have a good time?â€ â€œWe had a great time, baby. We had a good time, huh, Frankie?â€ â€œThatâ€™s good. Frankie, give me your candy.â€ â€œWhy, Mom?â€ â€œBecause I need to go through your candy to make sure itâ€™s safe for you to eat.â€ â€œWhy wouldnâ€™t it be safe? It all came fromâ€¦â€
[in Spanish] â€œShut up, you idiot! Shut up. Shut up, you son of a bitch. Shut up.â€ He almost took down the empire, know what Iâ€™m saying? So he hands over the bucket and she grabs it and immediately dumps it out on the table right in front of us. She notices, you know. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of the same candy right here.â€ â€œA lot of the same candy.â€ â€œCan you explain why thereâ€™s so much of the same candy in Frankieâ€™s bucket?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know what to tell you, baby, thereâ€™s a lot of basic bitches in this neighborhood.â€ â€œWe canâ€™t go back to that other neighborhood because they got cameras and theyâ€™re gonna know us and we donâ€™t want to be â€˜that person.'â€
So fast forward one year. It is now October 31st, 2008. And for some reason, Iâ€™m not booked on Halloween again. And so my girlâ€™s like, she swears up and down.
â€œOh, itâ€™s a sign, itâ€™s a sign.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œItâ€™s a sign my agent is slacking.â€
Shout-out, Matt, I know youâ€™re here. Sorry about that joke. Youâ€™re doing a great job, thank you for this one, but that year you dropped the ball, soâ€¦ But anywayâ€¦
[chuckles]
And so Frankieâ€™s mom is like, â€œI think that, you know what?â€ â€œMaybe, just maybe, we can make this like a tradition.â€ â€œThis could be you guysâ€™ thing: the two of you go out trick-or-treating and then Iâ€™ll stay home and give out candy.â€ â€œThis could be your thing.â€ I go, â€œYou know what, baby, sounds good to me.â€ â€œFrankie, come on, weâ€™re going trick-or-treating.â€ â€œWhat about my mom?â€ â€œSheâ€™s gonna stay home again.â€ â€œYay!â€ So we get outside, we get in the car.
[imitates doors closing]
I lean over and I look at Frankie and I said, â€œFrankie, are you thinking what Iâ€™m thinking?â€ â€œWalmart!â€ We pull up to Walmart.
[engine revs, tires squeal, doors slam]
We walked in, I said, â€œFrankie, grab a cart.â€ â€œFollow me!â€ And I lead him all the way to the candy section. As soon as we get to the candy section, I stop the cart and I get in his face. I said, â€œFrankie, you have exactly 30 seconds to grab as much candy as you can.â€ â€œReady? Go!â€
Apparently, this motherfucker was training all year for this. As soon as I said â€œGo!â€ his arm, bam, and he starts gutting the shelf. Heâ€™s ripping bags of candy into the cart. He overflowed the shopping cart in ten seconds. I firmly believe thatâ€™s the first day of my diabetes. And thatâ€™s a story that Iâ€™ve been sharing, you know, at parties and just close friends, and I just recently started telling it onstage. And he overheard me one time saying the story, and heâ€™s like, â€œReally? Still?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œItâ€™s a good story!â€ â€œYouâ€™re the hero!â€
And, you know, some things transpire. And, uh, one day he wanted to have a conversation with me, and he caught me off guard. Heâ€™s like, â€œCan I talk to you, Dad?â€ â€œYeah, whatâ€™s up?â€ â€œI have something I want to tell you.â€ â€œOkay, whatâ€™s up?â€ â€œItâ€™s important.â€ â€œOkay.â€ â€œItâ€™s serious.â€ â€œCan you please sit down?â€ â€œHow far along is she?â€ â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ â€œDonâ€™t be scaring me, dude.â€ â€œItâ€™s about us.â€ â€œOkay.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€
He tells meâ€¦ â€œCan you please stop making fun of me?â€ And when he said it, I felt it, because I knew how hard it was for him to bring that up. And I said, â€œHow long have you felt this way?â€ â€œMy whole life.â€ â€œHave you ever tried to bring this up in the past?â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œWhat did I say?â€ â€œYou told me to put on deodorant.â€ â€œIt worked.â€ â€œLook, Frankie, umâ€¦ I didnâ€™t know how to be a dad, okay?â€ â€œIt was one of those things where there were certain things I didnâ€™t want to do.â€ â€œI knew that I never wanted to yell at you, and I knew for a fact that I never wanted to hit you.â€ â€œSo I did the best thing I could do with what I knew how to do.â€ â€œI made fun of you!â€ â€œThatâ€™s called shaming.â€ â€œThis year.â€ â€œLook, if you donâ€™t want me to do any more stories or jokes or just make fun, I understand.â€
Itâ€™s one of those things where I didnâ€™t want to make him feel bad, and I donâ€™t want to feel bad, you know what I mean?
So I said, â€œLook, Iâ€™m going to let the audience know that we spoke. Andâ€¦ so that they understand why, moving forward, in the future, there will be no more stories about Frankie.â€
â€œWhy is that important?â€
â€œBecause if I donâ€™t explain why I stopped talking about you, theyâ€™re gonna think you died.â€
â€œI donâ€™t wantâ€¦ â€œ
â€œI donâ€™t want them to think you died either.â€
Gave him a big hug, reminded him how much I love him, â€™cause I love him very much, and I hope he knows that.
[cheering]
I think that a lot of the issues and frustrations weâ€™ve had for a while now have a lot to do with the fact that I am no longer with his mom. I donâ€™t want you guys to think that Iâ€™m going to start doing jokes about her. Iâ€™m not. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the woman I was with for almost 14 years. Okay? Nothing bad, nothing negative, nothing derogatory, nothingâ€¦ nothing short of awesome. Nothing short of good vibes, okay? I have nothing bad to say about her. And not just because I signed a piece of paper that said I wouldnâ€™t say anything bad. But because, at the end of the day, that is still my sonâ€™s mom and I need to make sure she continues to support me being his dad. So you got to keep it cool. I will tell you, though, that I did not handle the breakup well. She was, in fact, the first breakup, like realâ€¦ She was my first true love. Iâ€™ll just say it, she was my first true love. And I did not handle it well. Youâ€™re supposed to have your heart broken when youâ€™re, like, 12. When you have your first crush. Thatâ€™s when youâ€™re supposed to have your first heartache, not in your forties. Itâ€™s supposed to be when youâ€™re young, youâ€™re little, youâ€™re resilient. You realize itâ€™s not going to work out, so youâ€™re devastated.
â€œNo!â€
â™ª And Iâ€¦ â™ª
Yeah. Not when youâ€™re in your forties. So, without divulging too much information, let me just tell you that, when everything was finalized, I was at the gas station and I got a text message basically saying, â€œEverythingâ€™s been signed.â€ â€œItâ€™s official, itâ€™s turned in.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, wow, okay.â€
I get in the car, I start the car, and then I put it in drive. And thatâ€™s when it hit. Thatâ€™s when it became real. Thatâ€™s when it was like, â€œOh, my God.â€ â€œI can no longer go home.â€ Thatâ€™s no longer an option. I have messed things up. I can no longer go back to what I called home. I have to restart my life right then and there at the gas station. And I had a full-blown meltdown. And some of you know that my tour came to an end a while back and people were wondering, is it drugs, is it alcohol, is it mental health? I was going through my first breakup. How was I supposed to be an effective comedian when I couldnâ€™t stop crying? You know what I mean? It was bad. And you guys have heard the shows before, you know I never bring this up. It was the lowest point of my life. I had never felt so sad, weak, vulnerable, depressed, lonely, everything all rolled into one. And it was at the lowest point of my life that I foundâ€¦ Thatâ€™s right, country music. Country music knows when youâ€™re sad. Country music knows when youâ€™re weak. Country music knows when youâ€™re vulnerable and you need something to fill the void. I used to fight off country music. I used to look country music in the face and tell country, â€œYou can take your achy-breaky heart, you keep on movinâ€™.â€
But not today. Let me tell you whatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™m in the car and Iâ€™m crying so much, my tears are rolling down my cheek and theyâ€™re blending with my snot. Theyâ€™re blending with my mocos. My tears are blending with my mocos, and then blending with my babas, with my drool. I have three different fluids coming out of my face at the same time. My neck looked like menudo. It was bad. All I needed was a pinch of limÃ³n and say, â€œThatâ€™s it, right there.â€
I am making ugly sounds, and I donâ€™t want to hear myself, so I turn on the stereo, and I started hitting buttons. And it lands on the country station. And I knew immediately that it was country music I was listening to, and I did not try to change the station, because I figured, you know what? I deserve to suffer more for the mistakes I made and the people I hurt.
So I let it play. And play and play and play. I listened to country music for over an hour and I came to this conclusion: country music has at least one song that will speak to your heart directly because you feel like the artist wrote the song specifically about you and your life, because of how detailed the songs are. Oh, yeah, my hatâ€™s off to country music singers and artists. You guys, you know how to do something very well, and itâ€™s not till you experience a certain time of your life that it makes sense. Iâ€™m in that car bawling and all of the sudden on the radio, I hear thisâ€¦
â™ª Itâ€™s been seven days â™ª â™ª Since you seen her â™ª
How does he know itâ€™s been seven days since Iâ€™ve seen her?
â™ª You just canâ€™t Get her off your mind â™ª â™ª â€˜Cause every little thing That you do or say â™ª â™ª Is another reason You pushed her away â™ª â™ª And now youâ€™re sittinâ€™ in your car â™ª â™ª All alone â™ª
Waaaa! How does he know? Make it stop! And it doesnâ€™t stop, it keeps kicking you on the ground, reminding you what a piece of crap you are.
â™ª You should have gone home And locked the door â™ª â™ª But you was outside being a whore â™ª â™ª And now youâ€™re sittinâ€™ in your car â™ª â™ª All alone â™ª
So moving forward, itâ€™s been over a year now, and the same question has been asked over and over again: â€œSo, what now?â€ â€œAre you gonna start over, you gonna get back up on that horse, you gonna get a girlfriend, you gonna get a wife, start a new family, what are you gonna do?â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œI got dogs.â€ â€œIâ€™m good right now.â€
I know what itâ€™s like to be single for a long time, and I know what itâ€™s like to be in a relationship for a long time. And thereâ€™s pros and cons to both. I can only speak for the guys on this one. Some guys. Guys, you ever been single so long, you start to question whether or not itâ€™s by choice? And then you find yourself saying things like, â€œGuess Iâ€™ll be single forever, you know, just nobody wants me.â€
â™ª Nobody wants me, nobody wants me â™ª
Some of you are laughing â€™cause you have that friend. A lot of you are quiet, â€™cause thatâ€™s you right now. And then you notice how sometimes all it takes are just a couple of minor changes, a couple of minor adjustments to get back in the game. Like, maybe you start cutting your hair different. Maybe you start dressing better. Maybe you start, I donâ€™t know, showering and shit. Someone takes notice and decides to give you a chance, and now youâ€™re back in the game. And thereâ€™s no greater feeling in the world than that of being in a brand-new relationship â€™cause youâ€™re just so happy. Youâ€™re so happy, youâ€™re the most optimistic person in the world. Nothing can mess your day up when itâ€™s brand-new. You can miss your bus on the way to work.
[imitates bus passing]
â€œThereâ€™ll be another.â€ You could get fired. â€œGuess it wasnâ€™t meant to be.â€ You are so freaking happy. And then you start to reflect on your life before the relationship, and you remember how you would look at your phone and it would never ring. You thought it was broken because thereâ€™s no text messages. You look at your DMs, nothing. But the minute you get into a brand-new relationship, like magic, your phoneâ€¦
[imitates buzzing]
Text message. Ding! Your social media, now you got numbers in there. People in the street are talking to you, and then you say this out loud. â€œWhere were all these people at when I was single?â€ Answer: they were there the whole time. The difference is, you were not this happy. I found out that happiness is one of the most attractive things in the world. Who doesnâ€™t want to be around someone whoâ€™s positive? You know? Unless you got Covid. Never mind. Nice, pleasant. A joy to be around. Good energy. You know who really notices just how happy you are, guys, when itâ€™s that brand-new relationship? Other women. Not your woman. Other women. They canâ€™t help but notice how happy you are. They stare at you and they point.
â€œLook at him. Look how happy he is. I bet I can change that.â€
Guys, you are now blood in the water, and the sharks are out. And if youâ€™ve never been hunted before, it is one of the scariest things in the world. â€˜Cause usually you donâ€™t know youâ€™re being hunted until itâ€™s too late. Youâ€™re over there minding your business, youâ€™re in your relationship, youâ€™re trying to make it work, and here they come.
[imitating â€œTheme from Jawsâ€]
Before you know it, itâ€™s too late, sheâ€™s got ahold of you and she has you pinned down in the back seat of a car. And sheâ€™s hitting you. Sheâ€™s hitting you with aâ€¦
â™ª Baby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do â™ª â™ª Baby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do â™ª â™ª Baby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do â™ª â™ª Baby shark â™ª
You will never look at that song the same way again, youâ€™re welcome. â€˜Cause Iâ€™m a giver. I know. Theyâ€™re flashing. Okay, so, umâ€¦ Netflix is letting me knowâ€¦ [laughing] â€¦that my one-hour special has gone over by 37 minutes and 30 seconds.
[cheering]
Umâ€¦
[man] Keep it going!
[cheering loudly]
[chanting â€œFluffy!â€]
Should I keep going?
[cheering]
Should I keep going?!
[cheering]
Netflix. The people have spoken. For legal reasons, I must say this out loud. I have officially fulfilled my contractual obligation with the good people of Los Angeles and Netflix. The show is technically over. From this moment forward, anything you hear, if you donâ€™t like it or you donâ€™t think itâ€™s funny, you canâ€™t get mad. You canâ€™t get mad. â€˜Cause you didnâ€™t pay for it. The show is now over. This is now a Fluffy hangout.
[in Spanish] Fuck off.
[crowd chanting â€œFluffy!â€]
Thank you. Iâ€™m gonna keep going, but is it cool if I grab a soda? Okay. Because, wow, look. Sorry. Thatâ€™s why I said the show is officially over. All right.
[whistles]
To the city of Los Angeles and all surrounding counties and everyone whoâ€™s here tonight, salud!
[cheering]
I have a little bit more Iâ€™d like to share with you before I completely start breaking down again. Earlier tonight, I made a comment about how thereâ€™s some things about me that you donâ€™t know yet that are coming down the pike. Andâ€¦
[woman] Love you!
This next thingâ€¦ I love you too, maybe not after this story. Donâ€™t forget me. The story that Iâ€™d like to share right now happened a long time ago, but based on todayâ€™s rules, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s concerning me. Iâ€™m gonna share this story in a different way. Iâ€™m gonna tell you the ending first and then tell you how it happened. Like Star Wars. At least by me giving you the ending first, it allows the people that brought children to make a choice. Thatâ€™s whyâ€¦ see, youâ€™re already leaving. I see how it is. Iâ€™m sorry. Canâ€™t hang, huh? Okay. Hereâ€™s the end of the story. When I walked offstage, I was completely naked. Here we go. So 15 years ago plus, I was doing a show with my friend Martin.
[audience] Martin!
Thatâ€™s right.
[in Spanish] Come on!
We were doing a show together in Orlando, Florida, at a comedy club called The Improv. Now, The Improv is a comedy club chain thatâ€™s all across the country. Thereâ€™s a couple here in Los Angeles, so itâ€™s an awesome chain. The difference between this comedy club and any other clubs in the country is that the dressing room for the comics is actually on the stage. Not only is it on the stage, itâ€™s on the second floor. So thereâ€™s a door that opens up and stairs that lead down to center stage. So Martin is hosting and he introduces me.
â€œGabriel Iglesias!â€
And then here comes my big Cinderella ass come down the stairs, right? He hands me the microphone, gives me a hug, and then he whispers in my ear.
â€œBro, order a shot of tequila, Iâ€™ll explain later.â€
â€œOkay.â€
I start the show and, shoot, 30 minutes go by. Andâ€¦ I have completely forgotten about Martinâ€™s request. So out of the corner of my eye, I start seeing movement, and I turn, and itâ€™s Martin, and heâ€™s like this. And Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, shoot, I forgot. I sure could go for a shot of tequila right about now.â€
And here comes Martin walking with the tray. And the tray has two shots on it.
So Iâ€™m thinking, he must want to do a toast to the audience, right? Who knows? Itâ€™s a Tuesday. He comes down to the front row, and I guess during his performance, he was eyeballing some girl in the front. And he wanted me, his friend, to set up this magical moment for him to do a tequila shot with her so he could impress her so he could, you knowâ€¦ Martin! Baby Shark!
So I look at the girl like, â€œI think my friend wants to do a shot with you.â€ And she was excited, she was happy, sheâ€™s like, â€œOkay!â€
Martin hears â€œokayâ€ and he doubled down. Heâ€™s like, â€œLetâ€™s do body shots!â€
And she stands up, â€œOkay!â€ And the whole crowd is like, â€œWhoo!â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the hell?!â€ Martin grabs a lime off the tray and then he rubs it on his neck. And then he takes salt and sprinkles salt. And then she snatches the lime away from him and rubs it all over her chest â€™cause sheâ€™s a whore. Next thing you know, theyâ€™re making out in the front row, and the whole crowdâ€™s going crazy.
â€œMartin! Martin! Martin!â€
And they walked away together, and Iâ€™m like, what the hell? I didnâ€™t even get my shot! A couple of minutes go by, and here comes a guy, and he walks up to the stage and heâ€™s holding a shot glass, and he goes, â€œHey, Fluffy, you can have mine!â€ And he gave me his personal drink.
So I said, â€œThank you, bro, I appreciate that.â€
So I held it up and I said, â€œTo Orlando!â€ And everyone cheered, right? And then I slammed the shot, and then everyone cheered, and then I gave him back the glass, gave him a fist bump, and he walked away.
A couple of more minutes go by, here comes another guy. And this guyâ€™s holding a glass. Not a shot glass, a glass glass. And he gets to the front and he holds it up and he goes, â€œHey, Fluffy, take mine!â€ And I grab the glass, and itâ€™s full of black stuff. I said, â€œWhat is that?â€ And he said, â€œThat is JÃ¤ger.â€ â€œExcuse me?â€ â€œJÃ¤ger!â€ And it freaked me out because he would not close his mouth. â€œJÃ¤ger!â€ I smelled the drink, it smelled sweet, I said, â€œOh, this is gonna be good.â€
So I held it up and I said, â€œTo Orlando!â€ And everyone cheered, and then I slammed this double shot of JÃ¤ger. Oh, my God, it tasted like expired NyQuil. It was so bad. The guy looks at me, he goes, â€œWhat do you think?â€ I didnâ€™t want to be rude. He gave me his personal drink, so I sucked it up, Iâ€™m like, â€œIt was good, it went down the wrong way, Iâ€™m sorry.â€
[in Spanish] â€œItâ€™s for soothing a cough, for a cough!â€
I give him back the glass, he takes the glass, and then he does this, he holds it up, and then he goesâ€¦ And he licked the entire rim. I have seen enough episodes of Law & Order: SVU to know that if he commits a crime, I was there.
Iâ€™m like, â€œDude, what are you doing with the glass?â€
He will not explain why he did that, heâ€™s just laughing at me.
So Iâ€™m just following him and questioning him. He wonâ€™t tell me. Iâ€™m not paying attention. I donâ€™t realize that a small line has formed on the other side of the stage of people holding shots of JÃ¤ger. The problem that I have is that Iâ€™m a drinker. Clearly. And I have a rule. If Iâ€™m at a bar and Iâ€™m sitting at the bar, Iâ€™m in a drinking environment, if someone sends me a shot, I donâ€™t say no. I say, â€œThank you,â€ I accept the shot, and I tell the bartender, â€œWho sent it?â€ so that I can lock eyes with that person and go, â€œThank you,â€ and they can see me drink the shot so they know it didnâ€™t go to waste. If someone sends me a shot, I take that as a compliment. I think itâ€™s an awesome thing if someone sends you a drink, so when I send someone a drink, I mean good intentions with that drink. And if that person is, like, at the bar, and theyâ€™re like, â€œUgh, no,â€ Iâ€™d take offense to that. Iâ€™m like, â€œUgh, dick.â€
I donâ€™t want to make someone feel that way, so I know, if Iâ€™m in a drinking environment, I donâ€™t say no. I have already established the fact that this is a drinking environment. Iâ€™ve already done two rounds.
And so I see whatâ€™s going on, and Iâ€™m looking for help because thatâ€™s a lot.
So I look for security, and Iâ€™m like, â€œSecurity!â€ And security sees, and security was so clueless that night.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWant me to help you drink?â€
â€œNo, stupid!â€ Martin is gone somewhere, securityâ€™s clueless, so Iâ€™m stuck on my own.
So I walk over and I start drinking. I grabbed the first shot, and I held it up and I said, â€œTo Orlando!â€ Boom! Second one, â€œTo Orlando!â€ Boom! Third one, â€œTo Orlando!â€ Boom! After about eight shots, I was like, â€œTo Nanando!â€ Boom! After about 12 shots, I was like, â€œTo Armando!â€ Boom! I did 17 shots of JÃ¤ger.
At this point, people are no longer watching my show for the sake of stand-up comedy, theyâ€™re watching a train wreck and they donâ€™t want to leave â€™cause they want to see whatâ€™s going to happen. I am now reaching for number 18. And as Iâ€™m reaching for it, someone in the back of the room yells out, â€œTake it off!â€ And I was like, â€œYou take it off!â€ And then her boyfriend stands up. â€œHey! Sheâ€™ll take off whatever you take off.â€ And all of the sudden, we had a party. That girl came up onstage and she was beautiful. According to JÃ¤ger. Sheâ€™s standing on the stage next to me, but at this point Iâ€™m so gone, I can barely finish a sentence. So then the crowd starts chanting. â€œTake it off! Take it off!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHere we go,â€ so I kick off a shoe. She kicks off a sandal. I kick off the other shoe, she kicks off the other sandal. Then we started going toe-to-toe. Eventually I end up in my boxers and nothing else. And sheâ€™s in a sports bra and her underwear, and itâ€™s her turn, and we all know itâ€™s her turn. And this is what I feel like I might get in trouble for because I was instigating. I was likeâ€¦ â€œOh! Oh!â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna see something. Weâ€™re gonna see something.â€ â€œI donâ€™t know what weâ€™re gonna see, but weâ€™re gonna see something.â€ â€œItâ€™s either going to be mo-mo or meow-meow.â€ â€œItâ€™s going to be something.â€
As soon as she heard â€œmeow-meowâ€¦â€ she ran off the stage, and now Iâ€™m standing there in my boxers. No one there to help me. Finally, my friend shows up. Martin comes out the door, runs down the stairs, takes the microphone away from me. And he goes, â€œGet your ass upstairs.â€
Iâ€™m not paying attention, Iâ€™m just looking at the ground, you know? I am gone, Iâ€™m this guy. I look like the end of a Mortal Kombat game. So, Iâ€™m not looking at Martin, so he pops me in the chest. He goes, â€œHey!â€ And I see Martinâ€™s face. And his whole face is covered with salt. â€˜Cause heâ€™s a whore.
Martin says, â€œGet your ass upstairs!â€ â€œOkay, Martin!â€
So I start trying to walk up the stairs, but I canâ€™t â€™cause Iâ€™m too drunk, so I got to do that little baby bear crawl. You know, that football thing where you get on all fours. And so I crawled up the stairs like a little baby bear, and when I got to the top, everyone cheered. â€œHe made it!â€
And so Iâ€™m, â€œWhoo!â€ And Martin, heâ€™s just trying to get me to go away.
Heâ€™s like, â€œLadies and gentlemen, one more time for Mr. Gabriel Iglesias.â€ â€œThis man gave you everything he had!â€ â€œHe almost got naked for you!â€ And then I heard â€œalmost.â€ And a little devil appeared on my shoulder. And his name was JÃ¤ger! And from the top of the stairs, freakinâ€™ 3-2-1, â€œIâ€™ll tell you whatâ€¦â€ And I threw my underwear at Martin. Half the crowd saw my side naked profile, the other half saw Pikachu. Now, the problem with sharing a story like that is that people have questioned the credibility of that story. They say, â€œHow is it possible you could remember a story like that with such detail after drinking so many shots?â€ And honestly, I donâ€™t. But we recorded the show. So I know the story very well, you know.
â€œSheâ€™ll take off whatever you take off. Sheâ€™ll take off whatever you take off. Sheâ€™ll take off whatever you take off.â€
I know it very well. The question that Iâ€™ve always gotten over the years is, you know, â€œAre your stories real? You know, we hear these crazy stories, whether itâ€™s about me and Snoop Dogg or Martin or all these different adventures or my son Frankie. People have always questioned whether or not the stories are, like, legit-legit. And so in my last special, I addressed it. I was tired of people asking if my stories were real, so to prove a point, at the end of my last special that I did, I included a photo of every single one of the stories that I talked about so that people would know the stories are real. And tonightâ€¦ is no exception. Soâ€¦ Did I really get naked onstage? Ryan, hit the button. Iâ€™m fucking with you.
[laughs]
Oh, my God, you guys thought you were gonna see 3-D. Iâ€™m sorry, I did that for me. Oh, my God. You were getting stressed, like, [in Spanish] â€œYou asshole! There are kids here!â€ Oh, my God. The number-one question Iâ€™ve gotten when it comes to my shows is, â€œWhat is your writing process?â€ My writing process is simple. I do not sit and write out jokes. I am really bad at that. Ask the Oscars. I experience things, and then I come out onstage and I share them, and sometimes people laugh, and if they laugh, I keep that, and whatever doesnâ€™t get a laugh, I work on until it gets a ha-ha.
Fifteen-plus years ago, my friend Ivan, who is one of myâ€¦ he is my number-one longest, oldest employee. Not old like, â€œHello, how are you?â€ Heâ€™s been around a long time. Heâ€™s been there from day one. Ivanâ€™s original job was to record my shows using a camcorder. Now, the fact that Iâ€™m saying â€œcamcorderâ€ should be an indication of the timeline. â€˜Cause some of you right now are like, â€œWhatâ€™s a camcorder?â€ It was the Snapchat of our day.
So Ivan would record the shows and then put away the camcorder and the tripod and a bunch of tapes into a bag. It was very bulky, it wasnâ€™t a phone, it was bulky. And then weâ€™d go back to the hotel and heâ€™d break the little guard off the back of the TV and then heâ€™d hook it up and weâ€™d watch the thing, and thatâ€™s how I would review my material. One night, we go to dinner. Ivan packed up the bag. And we met in the hotel lobby. And Ivan forgot the camera bag in the hotel lobby. And we went to dinner, and when we came back, it was gone. And we never recovered the tape. And I know some of you are like, â€œHow convenient.â€ â€œThe tape of him getting naked is gone.â€ And to you I say, â€œWhy would I even make up such a story that could potentially hurt my credibility or my image?â€ I donâ€™t need five minutes of ha-ha. What I need is there to not be a tape. I know that thereâ€™s footage out there of me doing something really embarrassing and something I wish I could take back, and I know that, when this Netflix special airs, a lot of people are gonna see it, and hopefully the person who has the footage is watching. And I would like to tell that person right now, in your living room, I know you have the tape. I have $50,000 with your name on it. Come get paid.
[fans chanting â€œFluffy!â€]
For the last 25 years, every year I get the same question. People ask me, â€œGabriel, in all your years of doing comedy, what has been the greatest moment of your career?â€ And itâ€™s always been one of those things where I never try to put a highlight to one specific thing, because there have been so many incredible moments over the last 25 years. You know? I love the fact that my mom saw so much of it and she saw her son become successful and that she raised someone that was respectful of people and that, you know, chased his dream. And Iâ€™ve always been very, like, I never wanted to put a specific date or time or event on one thing, whenever people would ask, â€œWhat has been the greatest moment of your career?â€ The problem is, I think that, if someone were to ask me the question on Mondayâ€¦ â€œGabriel, what has been the greatest moment of your career?â€ I think I have an answer.
[cheering]
Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m not trying to mislead you guys. This is not the greatest moment of my career. This is the greatest moment of my life.
[cheering and applause]
And if I die tomorrow, I did everything Iâ€™ve ever wanted to do and then some. I think at this point, thereâ€™s only one thing left to say. I get pulled over one night two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-thru. I made a left turn instead of making a right turn, but I wasnâ€™t paying attention because I had a box, right? I was like, â€œYouâ€™re going to get it when you get home!â€ â€œYouâ€™ve been so bad, so bad!â€ â€œAaah! Youâ€™ve been so bad.â€ Iâ€™m not paying attention, I go the wrong way.
[imitates car passing]
[siren wailing]
Awwww!
[engine revs, tires squeal]
Hmm!
[in falsetto] Later.
[speaking gibberish]
The officerâ€™s taking forever. I said, â€œForget this, heâ€™s taking too long.â€ I grab my box, I put it on my lap, I flipped it open. â€œAhh! Mmmmm!â€ â€œHa-ha-ha-ha!â€ â€œMm-waah! Waaaah!â€ And just as Iâ€™m about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window. â€œYou know why I stopped you?â€ It was too easy, I said, â€œâ€˜Cause you can smell it!â€
[cheering and applause]
Los Angeles. I love you. You are my home. Thank you for 25 years. Thank you for the greatest night of my life. I will never forget you. Thank you. Thank you. This show is dedicated to the memory of Vincente Fernandez! MuchÃ­simas gracias! Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Martin!
[Vincente Fernandez singing â€œEl Reyâ€]
Give it up for the man that made history tonight. You guys and Gabriel Iglesias! All I can tell you right now, this cabrÃ³n right here, Gabriel Iglesias, pulled all you guys together to unite Los Angeles. Every color, every single race, every single belief, every single faith, every background, every neighborhood, everybodyâ€™s here united in laughter because of Mr. Gabriel Iglesias, ladies and gentlemen.
[crowd chanting â€œFluffy!â€]
Listen to me, everybody out there with a dream, these are three Mexican kids from the freaking â€˜hood, cabrones, all right? East Los Angeles! East Los. Long Beach! Wilmington! Thatâ€™s right. And I tell you, if we can follow our dreams, you follow your dreams, cabrones.
Please.
I donâ€™t care what it is!
[Gabriel] Donâ€™t make excuses.
Donâ€™t let nobody tell you no!
[Gabriel] Donâ€™t make any excuses, you guys. If we can do it, por favor. I know that somewhere tonight, someoneâ€™s watching this special, theyâ€™re going to be inspired to do something great. I know that a few years ago, I was in Philadelphia and I saw Kevin Hart in front of a football stadium perform a show like this, and I said, â€œYou know what, Kevin Hart can do it, I can do it.â€
So I hope somewhere tonight, someone is watching this, says, â€œYou know what, I can do it too.â€ Whatever your dream is, please go for it. Please chase it. Work hard for it, sacrifice.
[in Spanish] Just do it.
[crowd chanting â€œFluffy!â€]
So, Martin, did he really get naked? Did he get naked? His balls were everywhere!

[cheering]
Oh man! Stop!
[cheering continues]
Stop! Chicago, whatâ€™s going on?
[cheering]
Oh man! Thank you for being here at the beautiful Chicago Shakespeare Theater.
[cheering]
A lot has transpired in the last couple of years, right? The world has dealt with some crazy stuff. It felt like the end of times, and I thought lesbians would be built for that, you know?
[laughter]
Put us in a bunker with some canned hams, weâ€™re good.
[laughter]
But things went south, and I learned a lot about myself. I found out I have zero survival skills. None. All I had to do was stay home. I got nothing accomplished. No sourdough was started in my house. I didnâ€™t learn how to make cold brew. Nothing. It was my partner, Jax, who surprised me. She was the one outside painting our fence, rewired our electricity, fixed our plumbing. I was the one on the couch every night, just watching documentaries about old people in love.
[sighs]
Just crying in my Ugg boots.
[laughter]
I found out, yâ€™all. Iâ€™m not butch.
[laughter]
Yeah.
[cheering and applause]
I am not butch, which is shocking, I know, â€™cause I have these broad shoulders and my favorite color is plaid.
[laughter]
But this is a preview to a whole different movie than what you think youâ€™re about to watch. As they say, the carpet does not match the drapes. Two things that I do not know how to install.
[laughter]
[cheering and applause]
I look very handy, though. I do. I look handy. If you saw me and your car was broken down, you might assume I could fix your car. I got that look about me, â€™cause that is what a butch lady can do. She can literally put your car on her backâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦and walk it to a service station.
[laughter]
She can actually just spit in your gas tankâ€¦ [imitates spitting] â€¦and your car will start.
[laughter]
[sighs] Magical. But that is not me. And men are the most mystified by this information. They come up to me constantly at, like, a Home Depot because they assume I work there.
[laughter]
Theyâ€™re like, â€œUh, whatâ€™s up, dude? Umâ€¦â€
â€œWhere are the nails?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œOoh, Iâ€™m here for a potted plant.â€
[laughter]
â€œI do know they sell M&Mâ€™s at the checkout.â€
[laughter and applause]
We got bored at one point, and we drove out to the desert in California, out to Joshua Tree, and I noticed up ahead on the freeway, there was this car broken down, and this guy whose car it was, he was really tall. He was ripped, shirtless, he had a man bun. Straight ladies, are we still into man buns?
[woman] No!
Oh, hard no right there. Wow. This guy had on black-and-white striped pants. Looked like a gorgeous prisoner that had escaped. Now his car is broken down on the side of the road. Iâ€™m driving past him, I look over my shoulder, I realize itâ€™s Jason Momoa. Yeah. Oh, you like man buns now, donâ€™t you? Yeah. Thatâ€™s what I thought.
[applause]
It was Aquaman, miles from the ocean, just stranded in the desert without his superpowers. Beautiful, shirtless. I kept driving.
[laughter]
Weâ€™ve been over this. I canâ€™t fix his car. I canâ€™t give him a BJ while he waits for somebody else to fix his car. I got nothing for this man.
[laughter]
I did the next best thing. When I had to get gas, I went to his Instagram page. â€œLet me just double-check to see if it was him.â€ To me, all dudes look alike.
[laughter]
Went on his page, he had posted a picture of him in the black-and-white striped pants, side of the road. I went, â€œOh my God, that was Jason Momoa.â€ And I gave his picture aÂ like.
[laughter and applause]
I did my part. But Iâ€™m a lot different than what meets the eye. I am a dainty lady. I am a delicate flower. I like a massage every now and then. This girl likes to be pampered, yâ€™all. I got a butt massage for the first time recently. Have yâ€™all had one of those? Oh man! Iâ€™m not talking about an elbow to the glute. Iâ€™m talking full-on butt, booty massage. I mean, I was at this very respectable spa, on my stomach, and this guy just started going in on my ass.
[laughter]
Making noises too.
[exhaling loudly]
I wentâ€¦ [gasps]
[laughter]
I clutched my invisible pearls.
[laughter]
I had never been touched by a man like this before.
[laughter]
He just kept digging into my butt, and he unlocked some sort of treasure.
[laughter]
I had never felt anything that good before. I went home that night light as a feather. A whole new woman. I cooked a three-course meal. I donâ€™t even know how to cook.
[laughter]
I called a few days later. I had to book another appointment. This guy was booked solid for a month. I was like, â€œOh, this is, like, his thing. Heâ€™s the butt massage guy, and everybody knows about it.â€ So I finally got back in there a month later, same thing. Went in on my ass.
[exhales loudly]
This time for, like, 30 minutes. He spent more time on my butt than I have ever spent taking care of my face.
[laughter]
He wouldnâ€™t touch anything else. Like, my feet, â€œUgh, gross! Ugh.â€ Just all butt. Went home. Called a couple of days later to make another appointment.
[laughter]
He had gotten fired.
[laughter]
Yeah, somebody ruined it for all of us. Freaking butt narc.
[laughter]
[groans] Turns out he unlocked too many treasures.
[laughter]
But the one person I did not want to find out that Iâ€™m not as tough as I appear is my partner, Jax. I did not want her to know this information, because before me, she dated nothing but butch women, and Iâ€™m talking butch. Iâ€™m talking cops, truckers, and bouncers. Oh my!
[laughter]
Butch. Iâ€™m a whole different vibe. Iâ€™m like, â€œWho wants a hug?â€ Like, so different. But we were going to this fancy Hollywood event, and I was trying to play the part, so I had on my Menâ€™s Wearhouse suit.
[laughter]
Jax had on her dress and heels, and we got a phone call from the alarm company. They said our home alarm was going off, and did we want them to send security out to check? I said, â€œAbsolutely.â€ We turn back around. We get home, and nobodyâ€™s there yet. Jax shifts. She goes, â€œWell, we got to go in and assess the situation.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, we donâ€™t.â€
[laughter]
She said, â€œWell, my ex, Darlene, who was a cop, said that home alarms are the lowest of the priority.â€ I was like, â€œWait.â€ â€œI thought that exâ€™s name was Pam.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œThere is a Darlene and a Pam. Maybe youâ€™re thinking about Sheila.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHow many cops?â€
[laughter]
[groans] She dated, like, the whole lady force of Chicago.
[laughter]
She said, â€œYouâ€™re really not gonna go inside and check the house?â€ I said, â€œNo!â€ So she grabbed the high heel off of her foot like this and held it up like a weapon, and she charged in there with one shoe off.
[laughter]
Just going room to room, like she was gonna Jimmy Choo someoneâ€™s face if they jumped out. I stayed in the doorway â€™cause I had on flats.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m like, â€œHow am I gonna protect myself? I donâ€™t have a kitten heel on, nothing.â€
[laughter]
I heard a noise at one point, so I held the key fob up higher.
[laughter]
I was like, â€œI will press this button, I swear to God. It says â€˜Panic, â€˜ and Iâ€™m panicked.â€
[laughter]
The alarm company called, they said it was a false alarm. A battery had died in one of the sensors. They said, â€œWe are so sorry. We hope we did not cause you any inconvenience.â€ I said, â€œMy partner now knows I am useless. This is very inconvenient.â€
[laughter]
Jax came hobbling out. She said, â€œYou could have at least gone in there with me.â€ I was like, â€œOh my God, that did not even occur to me.â€
[laughter]
So I am not the protector of my family. And I know why Jax is so strong. I do. She is a kindergarten teacher, and they are tough. They have to be.
[cheering]
Yeah. Thatâ€™s a hard job.
[applause]
But I think about when I was in kindergarten in the â€™80s, and, oh boy, they just let you do whatever. I have a picture of me at five years old in kindergarten class, and I am holding a hammerâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦and nails. I mean, first off, somebody should have taught me how to use â€™em.
[laughter]
But Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy am I holding a hammer and nails?â€ Were we practicing hammering? Was the teacher like, â€œAll right, class, weâ€™re gonna build shelves for the classroom, and then afterwards, maybe a nice bench for my garageâ€? Thatâ€™s bonkers. Imagine your five-year-old right now. They cannot color inside of a giant circle, but youâ€™re gonna hand them a large, heavy hammer and hope that they can hit this itty-bitty, tiny nail. No! But thatâ€™s the kind of stuff that they would do in the â€™80s. I mean, recess alone was like, â€œGodspeed.â€ You were on your own. I mean, think about it. Our favorite game, dodgeball. You were taking a large, heavy ball and you were pummeling each other in the face as hard as you can. Thatâ€™s where we had to learn to Matrix.
[laughter]
To keep from getting our teeth knocked in. That game did come in handy for me a little bit later on in high school. I dodged a couple of balls. Not many. Umâ€¦
[laughter]
Never caught one. It was actually Red Rover that would get the most intense. You guys remember Red Rover?
[cheering]
You get in a line with your friends and you lock arms. Your other friends would get in a line across from you and theyâ€™d lock arms. And then you yell, â€œHold the line! Hold the line!â€ Like weâ€™re Braveheart.
[laughter]
Youâ€™re staring your friends down from across the field. Your only objective is to run as hard as you can right towards that line, and they just wanna break your arm.
[laughter]
Then all you wanna do is when theyâ€™re running towards you, you wanna grab your neighborâ€™s arm, you wanna pull your arms up, and then you just wanna crush their clavicle.
[laughter]
And then you start taunting each other. You go, â€œRed Rover, Red Rover, you send that little bitch Timmyâ€¦â€
[laughter]
â€œâ€¦right on over.â€
[cheering and applause]
Timmy gets that look in his eye. He starts running as hard as he can. Weâ€™re like, â€œHold the line!â€ Here he comes. We grab each otherâ€™s arm. We pull our line up. Now Timmyâ€™s crashed through our line. Now our armâ€™s dangling from the socket.
[laughter]
Weâ€™re like, â€œDid we win? Did we hold the line?â€ Your teacherâ€™s not doing anything. Sheâ€™s over there on the blacktop, just smoking a Virginia Slim.
[laughter]
Having some sort of midlife crisis.
[laughter]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œThey donâ€™t pay me enough to care about that.â€
[laughter]
The PE equipment was insane. We had merry-go-rounds. Theyâ€™re metal death traps. They were only fun if you would spin â€™em 60 miles an hour, and then we would try to run and jump on â€™em while theyâ€™re moving.
[laughter]
Itâ€™s like trying to jump on the hood of a moving vehicle. But there was nowhere to land. There was already 20 friends in a nook just going around.
[laughter]
Couldnâ€™t touch anything â€™cause itâ€™s 135 degrees in the sun. Inevitably one friend would fall off and get trapped. â€œAgh!â€ Bleeding from the kneecap now, weâ€™re trying to get our teacherâ€™s attention. Sheâ€™s like, â€œ20 more minutes!â€
[laughter]
â€œThis is me time.â€
[laughter]
And because Iâ€™m from North Carolina, we used to play with tires. Yeah, Iâ€™m talking about tires that fell off of a Mack truck, rolled into the elementary school parking lot. Our administrators are like, â€œWell, we donâ€™t got much of a budget, so weâ€™ll figure out something to do with these old things.â€ These were large tires. You stand them up, theyâ€™re this tall, like 75 pounds, hollow in the middle. We had a hill in the back of our elementary school, so it was our teachers who had to push these tires up that hill, [grunts] Just so angry, just pushing them up there. Theyâ€™re like, â€œI have a masterâ€™s in education.â€
[laughter]
We ran up there, we took our little five-year-old bodies, and we wouldâ€¦ We got into the middle of these tires. Our friend would take their five-year-old body, get in the other one. Then it was our teachers who would get behind each tire, and get momentum.
[laughter]
â€œAll right, you little fuckers.â€
[laughter]
â€œGet ready for the ride of your life.â€ And then they pushed us down a hill. We got speeds of, like, 20 miles an hour, 40 miles an hour, 60 miles an hour. Thereâ€™s no handle. Youâ€™re just likeâ€¦ [yells] We crashed into a brick wall, flew out of the tire, vomited.
[laughter]
Your teacher came down the hill, put her cigarette out on your forehead. Sheâ€™d be like, â€œRecess is dismissed. In fact, schoolâ€™s dismissed. I got to go meet my man friend who I connected with via the newspaper.â€
[laughter]
And that was recess in the â€™80s.
[cheering and applause]
It was a different time, yâ€™all. It was when you could take a large calculator and write the word â€œboobs.â€ Ah. My favorite number, 80085.
[cheering]
[Fortune chuckles] I mean, yeah, kids can get their phone out right now and see as many boobs as they want, but who got to write it out in numbers? We did.
[cheering and applause]
Good times, yâ€™all. But Iâ€™m glad to be in a relationship. I like it. It suits me. Dating is hard. Itâ€™s really hard. I donâ€™t know. You got to go on apps and swipe and do the things. Like, if I were single, my favorite dating app would beÂ Grubhub.
[laughter]
For sure. I think swingers have it figured out. I do. It had to be tough for them dating in the pandemic, uh, but they have ways to let each other know that they are swingers. Did you guys know this? Iâ€™m gonna teach you. All right. I found out that if you want to let people know that you are a swinger, you can put flamingos in your front yard. Yeah. It gets very confusing in Florida and at my momâ€™s house.
[laughter]
Maybe thatâ€™s why sheâ€™s been busy on the weekends. I donâ€™t know.
[laughter]
I donâ€™t quite understand it. Do people just drive around the neighborhoods looking for a flock of flamingos? They see it, they ring your doorbell and tell you theyâ€™re down to clown. I donâ€™t know. But I like it.
Thereâ€™s also, uh, an upside-down pineapple. You can put an upside-down pineapple on your front porch. Donâ€™t put it right side up. That is just a pineapple.
[laughter]
I always assumed that an upside-down pineapple was letting people know that you like cake.
[laughter]
I would stop and ring a strangerâ€™s doorbell for cake.
[laughter]
But I actually got approached by a swinger couple after a show. Uh, they came up to me. Yeah, it was very exciting. And I am not an ageist, I am just telling you a fact. This is just a fact of the story. They both had canes.
[laughter]
So this was not their first rodeo.
[laughter]
And the wife informed me that her husband really enjoyed the show, which I very much appreciated, and she said that he had told her by the end of the show that she was allowed to get with me.
[laughter]
[snickers]
Sexually? I donâ€™t know.
[laughter]
I didnâ€™t know what to say. So I curtsied.
[laughter]
[cheering and applause]
Which is not a no.
[laughter]
But it is polite.
[laughter]
But you got to put yourself out there, date different people. I went out with different people. I went out with a nurse at one point. And God bless nurses. They have gotten us through this crazy time.
[cheering and applause]
Yeah. I thought it would be different. I thought sheâ€™d come home in a sexy nurse outfit and be like, â€œWhoâ€™s got an owie?â€ And Iâ€™d be like, â€œMe.â€
[laughter]
But it didnâ€™t work like that. Sheâ€™d come home in her dirty-ass scrubs. She brought her work home with her. She was always following me around with a clipboard, asking me about my bowel movements. She thought I should lose weight, which, touchÃ©.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m just saying it wasnâ€™t fun to eat nachos with her, â€™cause sheâ€™dÂ look at me and then look at the nachos and be like, â€œOkay.â€
[laughter]
â€œAll right. Well, someone made a choice.â€
â€œMm-hm.â€
â€œThree kinds of cheeses, sour cream, and liquidÂ cheese?â€
[laughter]
Iâ€™m like, â€œItâ€™s called queso.â€
[laughter]
â€œAnd itâ€™s Spanish for heart disease.â€
[laughter]
â€œAnd itâ€™s delicious.â€
I knew it wasnâ€™t gonna work out right then and there. I was trying to find, like, a legitimate excuse to break things off. Sheâ€™s doing the Lordâ€™s work, and I didnâ€™t wanna just be like, â€œHey, you bum me out when I eat nachos.â€
[laughter]
Then I eventually met Jax right here in Chicago.
[cheering and applause]
At Gay Pride. Yeah.
[cheering]
Thereâ€™s hope. We met in a parking lot. [chuckles] We met in a parking lot. Thatâ€™s how few lesbian bars are left in the United States. The lesbians are just relegated to a parking lot where you can either party or valet cars. Itâ€™s up to you.
[laughter]
But we dated for a bit, but I knew pretty early on that, uh, Jax was the one. And it got to the point where I knew it was time to propose, and Iâ€™m not known for romance, so I called my friend. I said, â€œWhere should I propose to Jax?â€ And she said, â€œOh, you got to go to Big Sur.â€ And no, that was not my nickname in high school.
[laughter]
Itâ€™s a town in California out by the coast, really beautiful bridges and cliffs. She said, â€œThereâ€™s this hotel, very romantic, call there.â€
I called the hotel, and whoever was on the phone was upselling everything. I just wanted a standard cabin. She goes, â€œWhoa! Youâ€™re gonna propose? Donâ€™t you be cheap, okay? Donâ€™t be cheap. You better upgrade to that ocean view, Iâ€™m telling you. Itâ€™s worth it. Itâ€™s gonna knock her tits off.â€
[laughter]
I donâ€™t know if she actually said that, but that was the energy she was bringing to the conversation. Iâ€™m like, â€œFine.â€ I paid a bunch of extra money, got this ocean view thatâ€™s supposed to be great, and off we went. We get up there to this cabin, I walk in. A very old cabin, very expensive cabin. I said, â€œBut wait till you see this view.â€ And Iâ€™m about to open that back door, and I say to her, â€œHold on to your titties.â€
[laughter]
And I open that back door, we walk outside, and it is just fog, fog, fog. Just a hateful fog. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat is this? An 1800s lesbian period piece? Why is there so much fog? Is Kate Winslet down there searching for fossils?â€
[laughter]
[groans] Not how I wanted things to start, but I was like, â€œItâ€™s fine.â€
My plan was I was gonna take her to their fancy restaurant for dinner, and then I would go back to the room, and that is where I would propose. So I, uhâ€¦ I called ahead to the hotel and I say, â€œCan you guys help me make our room look like it does in The Bachelor?â€ I donâ€™t know, ladies seem to like that. â€œCan we get some candles and rose petals, uh, how about some champagne? How about some strawberries? But letâ€™s dip them in chocolate. Otherwise itâ€™s fruit.â€
[laughter]
They said absolutely, charged me a bunch of money. Happy to pay, happy to have the help. So off we went. We go to dinner. I go find the waiter â€™cause I need his help. I tell him whatâ€™s going on. So I walk up to him and I see that his name is Craig. And Craig is very dramatic. I think that he does local theater up there.
[laughter]
So I walk up to him. I go, â€œHi, Craig,â€ and he goes, â€œHi.â€
[laughter]
I said, â€œCraig, I am going to be proposing to my girlfriend tonight,â€ and he goes, â€œOhâ€¦ myâ€¦ God!â€
[laughter]
He reminded me of the candlestick in Beauty and the Beast. Just a lot of, like, â€œYou will propose, and the curse will be broken!â€
[laughter]
I was like, â€œThank you. Iâ€™m very excited, but Iâ€™m nervous. I donâ€™t want dinner to drag on. This ring is burning a hole in my pocket. So theyâ€™re doing stuff to our room. Do you mind near the end of dinner, calling the front desk, finding out if our room is ready, then giving me some sort of signal, and thatâ€™s when Iâ€™ll know to wrap it up?â€ He goes, â€œAbsolutely. You got it.â€
[laughter]
I said, â€œYou donâ€™t need to offer dessert, Iâ€™m taking care of that in the room.â€ He goes, â€œOkay.â€ And then he turns around like thisâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦and leaves.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m like, â€œI like Craig.â€
So we start eating this meal, and every course that comes out just ends up being weirder than the next. Itâ€™s too fancy for us. Itâ€™s too fancy. Itâ€™s a lot of foams and tentacles and shells. A lot of stuff from that â€œoceanâ€ I keep hearing about.
[laughter]
So everything is just a hair off, but we finally finish dinner, and, uh, Iâ€™m ready to get the night going, and Craig goes, â€œHi, ladies. Who wants dessert?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNot us, Craig.â€ He goes, â€œOops!â€
[laughter]
I was like, â€œCraig! You had two jobs, bud.â€
[laughter]
How could someone be so excited and incompetent all in one body?
[laughter]
So now Jax is very confused, â€™cause sheâ€™s never not seen me order dessert.
[laughter]
And Iâ€™m staring at her and I donâ€™t know what to say. Iâ€™m thinking about getting this right, I want it to be perfect. Itâ€™s the one story that everybody asks you about. They want every detail. And Craigâ€™s not coming, heâ€™s not coming. It is the least romantic dinner of our life. And then finally, after what felt like a lifetime, Craig sneaks up behind Jax.
[laughter]
And heâ€™s now hovering over her shoulder. She has no idea that he is behind her, and he is just staring at me soâ€¦ intensely.
[laughter]
I have been with Jax for seven years. We have never looked at each other in the eye for as long as Craig is staring at me. [exhales] Then finally, he goesâ€¦ â€œMm!â€
[laughter]
So proud of himself. Turns around. Into the fog, never to be seen of again.
[cheering and applause]
Weâ€™re heading to the room. Iâ€™m trying to think of all the things I want to say to Jax. I just want it to be perfect, I want it to be romantic. Weâ€™re getting up to the door, Iâ€™m starting to sweat. Iâ€™m getting nervous, and when I get nervous, I start doing finger guns.
[laughter]
So I look at Jax and start goingâ€¦
[laughter]
And then I am ready to open that door to romance. We walk in there, and it just looks like a crime scene.
[laughter]
Our eyes are adjusting â€™cause itâ€™s weirdly lit. You know what a room looks like when just the bathroom lightâ€™s been left on? Iâ€™m looking around, thereâ€™s, like, 50 tea light candles, but theyâ€™re all battery-operated. And half of them are just dead. Theyâ€™re just dead. Ten are flickering, like, â€œWeâ€™re trying!â€
[laughter]
My OCD brain is like, â€œWho made this call?â€ But I canâ€™t even focus on it because Iâ€™m standing on a mound of something. There are rose petals everywhere. Everywhere! Not in any way that makes sense. Thereâ€™s no heart shape or initials. Itâ€™s just chaos. It looks like someone opened that back door, a bunch of shit flew in the room, then they grabbed a leaf blowerâ€¦ [imitates leaf blower buzzing] â€¦and called it a night. Iâ€™m like, â€œDid I order the â€˜Itâ€™ll Doâ€™ package?â€
[laughter]
â€œWhat is this?â€ And when you guys think of roses and romance, what color do you think of?
[audience] Red!
Red? Interesting.
[laughter]
Well, these were white rose petals, half-dead. I googled later, â€œWhat do white roses stand for?â€ Itâ€™s chastity. Yeah. This is, in fact, an 1800s lesbian period piece.
[laughter]
So even though they did not apparently allow real candles in this cabin, they did light a roaring fireplace, and that was exactly where they decided to place the chocolate-covered strawberries and the bucket of ice with champagne. Both are just profusely dripping onto the floor. Nothing about this scenario makes Jax think that she is about to get proposed to.
[laughter]
I have a split second to decide which direction I am going with this night. Do I call the front desk and be like, â€œSomebody broke into our room and destroyed itâ€?
[laughter]
Or do I lean into this and pretend that every single thing that is happening in that room is exactly how I planned it? So now Iâ€™m staring at Jax like a deer in headlights. I canâ€™t think of any of the romantic things I was gonna say to her. Iâ€™m sweating again. Iâ€™m getting nervous. Oh man, here come the finger guns.
[laughter]
I forget to get on my knee. I canâ€™t think of anything. Iâ€™m panicked, so I just goâ€¦
[laughter]
And I yelled, â€œYou wanna?â€
[laughter]
Jax curtsied.
[laughter and applause]
And then, thank goodness, she said yes.
[cheering and applause]
Phew. So, umâ€¦ So now that we were engaged, we had to start planning our wedding. And we were engaged for a while, â€™cause truth be told, Jax and I are not big planners. And then my mom, Ginger, started offering up her wedding planning services. And I was like, â€œOh boy.â€ Because my mom got remarried later on in life, and I was at that wedding, and, um, my mom had a circus theme.
[laughter]
Yeah. She was marrying this old-school Southern guy who sounded like Foghorn Leghorn.
[laughter]
He was not part of the planning. Uh, I donâ€™t know if my mom thought she was planning a 12-year-oldâ€™s birthday party or her wedding, but thatâ€™s what happened. It was a circus theme. She invited 300 people. Thatâ€™s right, 300 people. To come to the Methodist church for this big party. And she rented a red-and-white striped circus tent and had them put it inside the fellowship hall. Not outside where tents go. Inside.
[laughter]
She rented a cotton candy maker. She said,â€ Iâ€™m gonna serve nachos with â€˜jalapee-nos, â€˜â€ as she called them. There was a juggler. I guess I was the clown.
[laughter]
She had just 12 gallons of ice cream. The main entrÃ©e was a hot dog cart. She just found some guy on the side of the road the week before, and was like, â€œWhat are you doing on Saturday?â€ And this guy got there. I donâ€™t think heâ€™d sold more than 20 hot dogs in a day. And now he has 300 starving people wrapped around the church, just desperate for one of his wieners.
[laughter]
He was just like, â€œAgh!â€ Panic. In the middle of this party, there were two round, plastic baby pools. I was like, â€œAre we bobbing for apples now?â€ No. My mom had put ice in both of these plastic baby pools and then put canned soft drinks in both of these pools and announced to the party that these were our coolers.
[laughter]
I walked in there and I saw two plastic baby pools being used as coolers, and I thought, â€œHere I am working so hard in Los Angeles, trying to make a name for myself, and we are trash.â€
[laughter]
â€œWe are trash.â€
My momâ€™s man friend walked in there in his penny loafers, not knowing what was going on. He about fainted. Like, â€œI do declare!â€
[laughter]
But the best part was the entertainment. They had a woman from the church choir singing, and this was her big solo moment, and she took center stage so confidently, and she started singing.
â™ª Go tell it on the mountain â™ª
â™ª Over the hill and everywhere â™ª
â™ª Go tell it on the mountain â™ª
â™ª That Ginger â™ª
â™ª Got married â™ª
[cheering and applause]
Oh, there was more. She started singingâ€¦
â™ª Oh when the saints go marching in â™ª
â™ª Oh when the saints go marching in â™ª
â™ª How I want to be in that number â™ª
â™ª When the saints go marching â™ª
â™ª In â™ª
[cheering]
[Fortune laughs]
That marriage lasted three months.
[laughter]
That circus tent was up longer than my momâ€™s marriage lasted. Soâ€¦ [laughs] We started planning our wedding and, uh, did not involve my mom. The pandemic hit, and we thought, â€œWell, I guess weâ€™re not gonna be able to get married.â€ Uh, but then the fall came, it was October, and weâ€™re like, â€œActually, this is the perfect time to get married. We can do it how we want and we donâ€™t have to worry about anybody else.â€
So yeah, it was great.
[applause]
We planned it in two weeks, rented an Airbnb out by the ocean, had a stranger in a mask be our officiant. We Zoomed our families. I think my mom is still on that Zoom call.
[laughter]
And itâ€™s not how either of us ever thought that we would get married, but it ended up being perfect â€™cause it was just about us and just about our day, and, uh, we even got baptized that day. Not on purpose.
[laughter]
Butâ€¦ But we were taking these, uh, these photographs, and we saw the sun was setting, and there was these stairs down to the ocean. We were like, â€œOh my gosh, we got to get a picture here.â€ So we stand over there, and our amazing photographer got a series of pictures. And in our first picture, we look beautiful. We look like, uh, two lesbians at prom together.
[laughter]
Gorgeous picture. Our second picture, weâ€™re kind of doing this â€™cause something is looming over us. Like the principal whoâ€™s angry that two lesbians went to prom together.
[laughter]
Then in the third picture, weâ€™re doing this because the ocean is now crashing into our earholes. Fourth picture, weâ€™re completely covered by water. Fifth picture, the oceanâ€™s been sucked back out to sea, and weâ€™re dripping wet likeâ€¦
[laughter]
â€œSo glad we decided to take this picture in the sunset.â€
[laughter]
We have all these pictures, and I think it means itâ€™s good luck. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been told. Itâ€™s good luck. Weâ€™re gonna go with that. But, uh, a few days after we got married, they announced online that we had gotten married, and we got a lot of love and a lot of support, which I really appreciate.
[cheering and applause]
I try to put out positivity, so when it comes back to me, it means so much. I try not to focus on negative stuff. I try to surround myself, uh, with positive things. I try not to read negative comments, but in a job like mine, you do hear from a lot of people. And I donâ€™t see everything, but occasionally a turd will get through.
[laughter]
And I happened to see this message on that day that was sent to me directly. And, uh, I wanted to read that message to you guys, if thatâ€™s okay.
[woman] Yes!
Yes! All right. Itâ€™s from a guy named Gary, and, uh, I will preface it with you are not going to like this message, but we are going to unpack it together.
[laughter]
So hereâ€™s what Gary wrote to me on the day it was announced that I got married. He said, â€œHow long have you and your wife been mentally ill, taco-licking lesbians who should be put in Alcatraz?â€
I was like, â€œWow, that is very specific.â€
[laughter]
There was no grammar in that message, by the way. He was like, â€œMentally ill taco lickingâ€¦â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI think he means â€˜mentally ill, â€˜ comma, â€˜taco, â€˜ hyphenâ€¦â€ You guys get it. Already Iâ€™m doing him favors.
[laughter]
And I guess I was bored on this particular day, because I was like, â€œI just got to see what this person looks like. Who sends a message like this to a complete stranger?â€
So I went on his page, and he did not have a picture of himself. It was a picture of an American flag, and written across of it, it said, â€œWe need God in America again.â€
That is what Gary leads with on Instagram, and then that was the message that he sent me. I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know that God would be into the phrase â€˜taco-licking.'â€
[laughter]
Call me crazy, which he didâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦but that did not sound very Christ-like to me.
[laughter]
By the way, there is nowhere in the Bible where it says what you can or cannot do with your Mexican food. Just so you know.
[cheering and applause]
That is up to you, my friends. So then Gary said that we should be put in Alcatraz. Now, IÂ donâ€™t know if he doesnâ€™t have Googleâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦but Alcatraz has not been a prison for a while. If thatâ€™s what he intended, itâ€™s not a prison. Itâ€™s actually a museum, and itâ€™s a museum in San Francisco, which is one of the gayest cities in the whole world.
[cheering and applause]
Iâ€™m like, â€œIs Gary telling me I should be in a gay museum?â€
â€œGary, stop. Am I a trailblazer? Stop, Gary.â€
At the top of the message, it said that he and I did not follow each other, which was not a surprise. But it did say that we followed one person in common. Iâ€™m like, â€œWho in the world could Gary and I possibly agree on? We seem like very different people.â€ And it said, â€œYou both follow Oprah.â€
[laughter]
What? I have to say, I did not take Gary as an Oprah kind of guy. But that is how famous Oprah is. She builds bridges.
[laughter]
So I read the message again. â€œHow long have you and your wife been mentally ill, taco-licking lesbians who should be put in Alcatraz?â€
And I was like, â€œWhy have I not moved on from this message?â€
[laughter]
And Iâ€™m looking at it. â€œWhat is it?â€ Then it hit me. I was like, â€œOh my God. Gary just recognized my marriage.â€ He said, â€œYour wife,â€ and that is called progress.
[cheering and applause]
Granted, he spelled â€œwifeâ€ with a Y, but I know what he meant.
[laughter]
And listen, there are a lot of people who fought many, many years for someone like me to be able to say â€œwife.â€ Gary said it in 2.2 seconds without even thinking. His head would explode if he knew how progressive that message was. So that is, in fact, progress, my friends.
[cheering and applause]
So we got married, we stayed at home for the next year like everybody else. I couldnâ€™t go on the road and do my job, which was really weird. And now that Iâ€™m back on the road, I do not take it for granted anymore. It is such a beautiful thing to come out and make people laugh, and to add some sort of levity to the world. I love Chicago, I love coming here. Itâ€™s one of my favorite cities.
[cheering and applause]
There was only one city on this tour I was nervous to go back to, and that was Des Moines.
[laughter]
Last time I was there, it was in the middle of winter, and I forgot that in the Midwest, when it is wintertime, and people are freezing, they get hammered. Hammered. It is too cold to go outside, there is nothing else to do.
So I get to the venue, and girls are coming out of the bathroom like this. There is toilet paper on the bottom of their shoes. It is 7 p.m. That is where we are starting this night. So I get out on stage, and they are just wanting to party. Theyâ€™re sending shot after shot, and I like drinks, but my vice is milkshakes, so Iâ€™m good. And they keep wanting me to drink Fireball Whisky. They love Fireball Whisky. I think it tastes like a bottle of gasoline with a stick of Big Red chewing gum plopped in the middle.
[pretends to retch]
Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m good.â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat?â€
â€œShe doesnâ€™t like Fireball!â€
â€œShe doesnâ€™t like Fireball. Shit!â€
They cannot fathom this information. So now as an audience, they only care about trying to figure out what drink to send me next.
â€œAll right, okay, she doesnâ€™t like Fireball.â€
â€œAll right. Oh, vodka!â€
â€œYeah, send it, send it!â€
All these vodka and cranberries start coming to the stage.
â€œIâ€™m not really a vodka person.â€
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat?!â€
â€œUh, she doesnâ€™t like vodka. Shit, she doesnâ€™t like vodka.â€
â€œAll right. Oh, beer! Yeah, send it.â€
All these beers start coming to the stage.
Iâ€™m like, â€œI never acquired a taste for it.â€
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWell, thatâ€™s surprising.â€
[laughter]
I know I look like somebody that would pound a beer, take the can and crush it on my forehead, and still recycle.
[laughter]
[cheering and applause]
Iâ€™m now taking these drinks theyâ€™ve passed up. Iâ€™m passing it back out to them. I am only making them drunker.
They go, â€œPlease, for the love of God, tell us what you drink. You cannot leave Iowa without having a drink with us.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s a weird rule, but all right.â€
[laughter]
Iâ€™m trying to think of a drink thatâ€™s gonna take a while to make â€™cause then I can do my job, tell some jokes. I go, â€œA sangria.â€
[laughter]
I forgot where I was.
[laughter]
I was like, â€œAll right, an old-fashioned.â€ I assume they got to find a mixologist with a little mustache. Heâ€™s gotta freeze a large ice cube, bitters, slice an orangeâ€¦ Itâ€™ll take a while. Two minutes later, these gorgeous old-fashioneds show up.
â€œAll right, fine. Is this gonna make you happy?â€
I grab this drink thatâ€™s meant to be sipped, and I justâ€¦ Down the gullet. [sighs] They are so pumped. You would think I had just competed in a decathlon.
[laughter]
So theyâ€™re having a good time. We get back into the show, weâ€™re laughing, the showâ€™s great. Later, they start getting restless again. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat now?â€ I look back, and thereâ€™s this older woman trying to make her way through the crowd. Sheâ€™s got short, spiky, gray hair, sheâ€™s got this worn face like she has seen some shit.
[laughter]
Sheâ€™s got a leather vest on. I assume sheâ€™s got a dreamcatcher in her car.
[laughter]
Sheâ€™s walking very confidently towards the stage, and she lands right there at the end of the stage, and I look and I see that she is holding a Smirnoff Ice.
[audience member] Oh!
And she looks at me and she goes, â€œHey. My nameâ€™s Lindaâ€¦â€
[laughter]
â€œâ€¦and you are about to get iced.â€
[laughter]
I grabbed the Smirnoff Ice and I said, â€œWhat time capsule did you dig this out of?â€
[laughter]
Thinking the whole crowd would agree. They start chanting, â€œIced, iced, iced, iced, iced!â€ They are relentless. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat is iced?â€ I have no idea what they are talking about. This very sweet Midwestern woman stands up. She goes, â€œGetting iced is when you get down on your knees, you take that bottle of Smirnoff Ice, you drink that whole bottle all in one gulp, and that is getting iced.â€
[laughter and applause]
Iâ€™m not getting on my knees and drinking a Smirnoff Ice. The whole room yells, â€œThose are the rules!â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œI am a grown woman, professional comedian.â€
Linda yells, â€œGet on your knees!â€
[laughter]
â€œYou are getting iced!â€
[laughter]
[laughter continues]
[cheering]
So I got on my knee. This would have come in handy during my proposal.
[laughter]
And I start chugging this God-awful Smirnoff Ice. Likeâ€¦ [groans] This malt liquor bullshitâ€™s falling down my face. Itâ€™s all sticky and gross, itâ€™s ruining my perfectly good cardigan. Theyâ€™re just going nuts. The audience is going nuts. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [groans] I finally finish this drink. Mm. [exhales] And I stand up. And something about that old-fashionedâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦and that Smirnoff Iceâ€¦ and that low gravityâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦did not mix. I am immediately seeing double. I donâ€™t finish my set. I donâ€™t say goodnight. I just look at the crowd and I said, â€œYou did this.â€
[laughter]
And I left.
[applause]
Passed out backstage. I come to, like, two hours later in the promoterâ€™s car. Iâ€™m waking up, Iâ€™m like, â€œHow did I get here?â€ She said, â€œWell, three very large security guards had to carry you outside.â€
[laughter]
Iâ€™m like, â€œI did not ask that.â€
[laughter]
â€œAnd it could have been done with two.â€
[laughter]
I said, â€œNo, what happened?â€
She said, â€œWell, you got iced. I donâ€™t know if it was that, if it was the mix of the two alcohols.â€
I said, â€œGet me out of Des Moines!â€
[laughter]
She goes to start the car, and it will not start. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh my gosh, I am not getting stuck in Des Moines!â€ Itâ€™s freezing cold, itâ€™s late at night, thereâ€™s no Ubers, my planeâ€™s leaving soon, people are icing me.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m just ready to leave, and I hear the doors burst open to the club. I look over. Here comes Linda.
[laughter]
She saddles up to the car. â€œWhatâ€™s up, ladies?â€
[laughter]
Iâ€™m like, â€œHey, Linda.â€
[laughter]
Iâ€™m trying not to make eye contact with her, â€™cause I donâ€™t know what kind of powers that dreamcatcher has.
[laughter]
I said, â€œHey, Linda, uh, our car wonâ€™t start, but weâ€™re good. We got it. Thank you for coming. Good night.â€
She took a look at me, she goesâ€¦ [clicks tongue] Gives me a wink. Walks to the back of the car, opens up that gas tank. [pretends to spit] Spit in the gas tank, and I got the heck out of Des Moines.
[cheering and applause]
Oh, Linda.
[Fortune chuckles]
So I have now been married for two years.
[cheering and applause]
And itâ€™s great. I love it. And, uh, we get that next question that you always get when youâ€™re newly married. Everybody wants to know if weâ€™re having kids. And Iâ€™ll tell you parents, you are not making it look fun.
[laughter]
You guys all have a glaze in your eyes. So weâ€™re dog moms right now. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing. And, uh, weâ€™ll see what happens. But we have this little Pomeranian named Biggie.
[cheering]
So cute. Heâ€™s a little guy, eight pounds, and a very happy, healthy guy, but he came down with something called HGE. Now itâ€™s this thing that dogs can get where they go from being totally healthy and fine to being super, super sick, and it can be deadly. It comes on fast, like 48 hours, and vets donâ€™t know how dogs get this. They say it could be from something they ate, it could be from stress. I was like, â€œThe Humane Society found Biggie eating out of a dumpster, and now he is walking around Beverly Hills in my wifeâ€™s Gucci purse.â€
[laughter]
â€œHe ainâ€™t got no stress.â€
[laughter]
His food is more expensive than mine. He ainâ€™t got no stress. So we have no idea where this came from or how he got it, but the signs of it start to show up at the beginning of our flight from LA to New York City, five and a half hours, and every hour, he got significantly worse. We couldnâ€™t do anything. We landed, it took us an hour to drive into New York City. We went straight to an animal hospital. Jax took him in the examination room, and I was filling out tons of paperwork. Itâ€™s so different than when I grew up with pets. I mean, back in the day, your dog slept inside, outside, your neighborâ€™s house. Itâ€™d roll up after two days, youâ€™d be like, â€œSparky, whereâ€™ve you been?â€
[laughter]
Your dog ate whatever leftovers your grandma threw over the fence from the Sizzler. And if suddenly your dog required a large medical procedure, your parents were straight up just like, â€œItâ€™s been fun,Â Sparky.â€
[laughter]
And that was it. But now I am the adult. I have to be the one that makes these decisions. So I filled out everything, and I hadnâ€™t seen Biggie in 45 minutes, so I donâ€™t know how heâ€™s doing at this point, but I do know this. It is time for me to step it up and be that protector of my family. It is time for me to be butch.
[laughter]
I have my Rocky moment, Iâ€™m, like, hitting myself in the face. I would do a push-up, but I canâ€™t.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m all bowed up, ready to walk in that room, all tough. I walk in that door, and Biggieâ€™s laid on the floor. Thereâ€™s blood everywhere, he is way worse, and I lose it.Â I just startÂ goingâ€¦
[screams]
â€œNo!â€
And Jax goes, â€œGet out of here! Youâ€™re bumming us out.â€
[laughter]
I got kicked out of the room!
[laughter]
I was forced to stand behind the glass door.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m just staring at my family. And Iâ€™d finally calmed down â€™cause the nurse gave me a lollipop.
[laughter]
And I was so frustrated, I was so disappointed in myself that I couldnâ€™t just pull it together for three freaking minutes, but itâ€™s not who I am. Iâ€™m a Cancer, Iâ€™m sensitive, and I cannot change that about myself. So I go wait in the lobby till four in the morning. Jax joins me, they go take Biggie back and hook him up to all these machines. Finally, the vet comes out and he talks to us.
He says, â€œListen, it is bad. He is at, like, 5%. And we will do whatever we can to try and save him, but for us to do that, he will have to be here for three to four days, round-the-clock care. Heâ€™s gonna have to have transfusions, plasma. We canâ€™t even guarantee that it will work. But for us to try, it is going to cost a minimum of $10,000. What do you two want to do?â€
[laughter]
[laughter continues]
Jax is like, â€œ$10,000? Iâ€™m a teacher. Thatâ€™s like a whole yearâ€™s salary.â€
[laughter]
Iâ€™m like, â€œ$10,000? Heâ€™s eight pounds. How much plasma could he possibly need? He canâ€™t just share a crate with a squirrel?â€
[laughter]
The vetâ€™s like, â€œI need an answer.â€
Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [groans] Jax isnâ€™t saying anything, so itâ€™s clear Iâ€™ve got to make this decision. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [groans] Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat would my parents do? No, no, donâ€™t think that.â€
[laughter]
Jax is starting to get more upset. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [groans]
[exhales]
[sighs] So I pulled out my man walletâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦and I grabbed my credit card and slammed it on the table. I said, â€œCharge it.â€ And then I looked Jax dead in the eye, and I said, â€œYou think Darlene could have done that?â€
[cheering and applause]
â€œNo!â€
[cheering]
â€œPam is broke. Sheila has shitty-ass credit.â€
[laughter]
Whoâ€™s butch? Iâ€™m butch!
[cheering and applause]
And the best part is, you guys, they did, in fact,Â save Biggieâ€™s life.
[cheering]
Whoâ€™s that?
[loud cheering]
This is Biggie, everybody!
[cheering]
Worth every single penny right here, you guys.
[cheering]
And give it up, everybody, for my wife, Jax!
[cheering and applause]
Thatâ€™s it from me, everybody. Thank you so much.
[cheering and applause]
Aw, thank you, guys. Thank you, Chicago!
[cheering continues]
[upbeat music plays]
Look at that. Goodnight, you guys. Thank you.
[cheering continues]
[upbeat music continues]

[crowd cheering]
Iâ€™ma tell you this much, though. These young women have been on my ass lately. I ainâ€™t gonna even lie, look. And I know theyâ€™re young, too. Because theyâ€™re always asking me for my Instagram instead of my phone number and shit. [crowd laughing] Yeah, thatâ€™s young bitch game.
[crowd laughing]
â€œWanna go out?â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s your IG?â€ Iâ€™ll be like, â€œArgh, young bitch! Shit.â€
[crowd laughing, clapping]
Could it be some old motherfuckerâ€™s asking for my Instagram, Iâ€™d be like, â€œNow, you know youâ€™re too old to be asking for my Instagram. Go get a pen.â€ [crowd laughing] â€œYou know better, motherfucker. Go get a pen. Old bitch keep a pen, donâ€™t you?â€ [crowd laughing] All this technology, that motherfucker is still got that pen. [crowd laughing] Phone right here in her hand. [crowd laughing] I asked a woman one day, I was like, â€œIf you see an attractive man, do you come on to him when you him?â€ She was like, â€œNo.â€ I was like, â€œReally?â€ I was asking another woman out. I was like, â€œIf you see an attractive guy, do you say anything to him?â€ She was like, â€œNo. If he donâ€™t say nothing to me, then it really ainâ€™t going down.â€ I was like, â€œThatâ€™s some dumb ass shit, man.
[crowd laughing]
Do you know how many potential soulmates, husbands your goofy ass could have had, [crowd laughing] if you woulda just said hi, waved, winked, smiled, pointed at a motherfucker?â€ You even ainâ€™t gotta look at the man directly in his eye. You can just look at his way and heâ€™ll get it.â€ A woman look my way too long, Iâ€™ma be like, â€œIâ€™ma go over there and put this thang on that bitch, I promise.â€
[crowd laughing]
I mean, you and I speaking. And you women over 45, let me tell you something. You canâ€™t afford not to speak to anybody. [crowd laughing] You need to be speaking to everybody you see. [crowd laughing] Every door you go through, you need to be like, â€œHey, yâ€™all! [crowd laughing] Iâ€™m Sheryl. I brought potato salad.â€ Bitch, you need to boil potato salad every goddamn door you go through, because time ainâ€™t on your side. [crowd continues laughing] Donâ€™t be mad at me. Thisâ€™s God talking to you right now.
[crowd laughing]
Iâ€™m just a vessel. [crowd laughing] Damn, older women know that. See, you gotta understand, like, woman 50, 55 and up, they understand you know that the older you get, and everybody knows this, men and women, the older you get, you know, time becomes the new currency. It really does. Money, Iâ€™ma make that. Iâ€™ma get that. But my time, you fuck over my time, motherfucker, weâ€™re gonna have a problem because I canâ€™t get that back. [crowd laughing, cheering] Goddamn it! [voice in crowd whoops] [crowd clapping] Motherfucker take me to a fucked up movie, Iâ€™ll be like, â€œBitch, Iâ€™ma need two hours about you.â€ [crowd laughing] Goddamn it. Older women know that, though. They move as such too. See, they donâ€™t ride with a whole bunch of women and shit. Like when they go out, they donâ€™t ride with a whole bunch of women and shit because itâ€™s too time-consuming, you know. Waiting on three bitches to get ready, youâ€™ll miss the show and shit. [crowd laughing] Going out to eat, one bitch want taco, one want a hotdog, one want a pizzaâ€¦ youâ€™ll starve fucking with these hoes. Old bitch will be like, â€œNo, just send me that address. Iâ€™ll meet you out there.â€

I donâ€™t need to text you.â€ [crowd laughing] â€œIâ€™m 50 for a reason, ho. Iâ€™ve made it this far. Iâ€™ma be alright. I donâ€™t need to start texting bitches, letting them know Iâ€™m leaving.â€ [crowd laughing] Yeah. [Deon laughing] Older women, lemme ask you something. If you ever have be at a party, and you see a young girl there and that motherfucker be dropping that motherfucker down to the ground, do you be jealous of her knees? [crowd laughing] Yes you do, bitch. Yes you do. [crowd laughing] Young bitch sweeping the floor with her ass. You canâ€™t go no lower than this. All your shit gotta be super-sexy up here.

My sonâ€™s mother, she said, â€œI canâ€™t keep that motherfucker in the house because I ainâ€™t getting any shit done with it in there, alright? Canâ€™t get shit done with that motherfucker in there. This motherfucker is 50 fucking dollars, you hear me?â€ And this is like this U-shaped device, right? This part goes in, itâ€™s vibrating and it curves around to the top. And on top, thereâ€™s this sucking mechanism that goes right on the clit. All it does is just sucks. [Deon hissing]

Ten speeds of sucking on this motherfucker. This bitch will collapse your forehead, I promise you. [crowd laughing, cheering] Itâ€™s serious. Now go ahead. Put it in your phone. Go ahead. No, go ahead before you forget it and shit. Put it in your godâ€¦ Donâ€™t worry about whoâ€™s looking at you. Put it in your phone. [crowd laughing] You old women, put itâ€¦ you know your mind ainâ€™tâ€¦ doing like it used to be. Go ahead, put it in your phone before you forget it. Sitting there trying to remember that shit. â€œHa ha ha, heâ€™s so silly. [crowd laughing] Tracyâ€™s Dog, Tracyâ€™s Dog, Tracyâ€™s Dogâ€¦â€ [crowd laughing] â€œTracyâ€™s Dog, Tracyâ€™s Dogâ€¦ â€œOkay, I know a bitch, sheâ€™s named Tracy. She got a dog. Tracyâ€™s dog.

It ainâ€™t just women. Men change too. We get old and shit. Like, we canâ€™t fuck the same. No, not at all. The older we get, now, we canâ€™t fuck the same. Shit, sometimes, n*ggas donâ€™t even be thinking about fucking like that, though. For real, though. Just imagine doing this for 50 years. Justâ€¦
[crowd laughing]
50 years, justâ€¦ Picking up all different sizes of bitches. 50 fucking years, justâ€¦ [crowd laughing] [crowd continues laughing] N*ggas get tired of that shit! 50 years of that shit, no. N*ggas canâ€™t be thinking about fucking all the time. Not successful men. No. Successful older men wonâ€™t be thinking about fucking. Weâ€™ll be having other shit on our minds like taxes and, â€œWhen are the kids moving out?â€ Payrollâ€¦ Motherfuckers depend on us. We got payroll. We ainâ€™t got time to be cuddling with your ass all the goddamn time. And then we are cuddling with you, we ainâ€™t thinking about you. [crowd laughing] You know what weâ€™re thinking about? When Iâ€™m gonna get the feeling back in my goddamn arm? [crowd laughing] From your big ass laying on it for two hours. If I wanna grab a titty, I canâ€™t feel it. [crowd laughing] Got no time to be cuddling with you, motherfucker I got payroll in the morning. â€œGrab that goddamn pen and help me crunch these numbers, bitch.â€ This is what older successful men do when it comes to our wives, girlfriends, fiancÃ©es and shit. We fuck to keep you. Thatâ€™s the realest shit you gonna hear. â€œNot my man.â€ Especially your man, bitch.
[crowd laughing]
Whoever the fuck just thought that. We fuck to keep you and thatâ€™s it. Your man could be sitting on the couch at home, one sock on, one sock offâ€¦ [crowd laughing] Holes all in his underwearâ€¦ Parliament Funkadelic t-shirtâ€¦ He just ate three sandwiches. You can tell from the bread crust on his plate. Grabbing his plate, going to the kitchen and making a fourth sandwich. [crowd laughing] And you come down the steps looking good to the motherfucker, heâ€™s like, â€œWhere are you going?â€ [crowd laughing] â€œI told you it was Aprilâ€™s birthday. Weâ€™re going out.â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna get something to eat, and after we get something to eat, weâ€™ll go get some drinks, soâ€¦ you ainâ€™t gotta wait up.â€ [crowd laughing] â€œLet me put a little dick in you before you get on outta here.â€ [crowd laughing, cheering] He didnâ€™t want to fuck. He had to fuck. [crowd laughing] Looking too good. You gotta put that dick in there. You ainâ€™t even thinking about no pussy. He was going to make another sandwich. [crowd laughing] Wasnâ€™t thinking about no goddamn pussy. You gotta put that dick in her before she go out. Man, before somebody else offer her some dick. See, one thing a lot of women donâ€™t do, they donâ€™t do two dicks in one day. That kinda fucks with their psyche and shit.
[crowd laughing]
Yeah. They donâ€™t do two in one day. So you gotta be the first one in there. [crowd laughing] You gotta get in there first. If she goes out and another n*gga offers some dick, sheâ€™s gonna be like, â€œOh! [crowd laughing] Damn, why did I let that other n*gga fuck me earlier?! Should have listened to my spirit.â€ [crowd laughing] Fellas, your girl ever come home from out kicking it all night and she goes straight to bed and youâ€™ll be like this, â€œHey, baby. Iâ€™ve been up waiting on you and shit. I know you had a good time tonight but come on. Hey, I know youâ€™re ready.â€ Sheâ€™ll be like, â€œLook, just let me go to sleep, please.â€ [crowd laughing] If that happened, youâ€™re number two. [crowd laughing] See how the laughter died down? [crowd laughing] Men, in here like, â€œHa ha haâ€¦ That bitch did that shit Thursday night.â€
[crowd laughing]
Thereâ€™s a certain age, a man should be where he should no longer be considered a gentleman. Like a motherfucker being 80 years oldâ€¦ He shouldnâ€™t be considered a gentleman, you shouldnâ€™t even look at him to be a gentleman. Motherfuckerâ€™s 80. But women donâ€™t give a fuck. As long as somebodyâ€™s doing something for your monkey ass, thatâ€™s all you care about. [crowd laughing] [woman in crowd] Thatâ€™s damn true. Iâ€™m at the airport and shit, this little young chick she gets to the door, she waiting on somebody to open it, Iâ€™m about 30 feet away, Iâ€™m like, â€œN*gga, I ainâ€™t about to go over there and open that door.â€ But here comes this old teskyer man n*gga like, [crowd laughing] Young bitch go through the door, the door slid his ass on. Like, â€œYou seen Iâ€™m struggling, bitch.â€ [crowd laughing] This woman gets on the plane with her luggage and shit. She like, [groaning] â€œUgh! I canâ€™t pick it up.â€ You knew you couldnâ€™t pick that motherfucker up when you packed all them goddamn sweaters and shit. But you ainâ€™t give a fuck â€™cause you thought some man gonna come along andâ€¦ And sure enough, here come this old civil rights n*gga likeâ€¦
[crowd laughing, cheering]
We had to grab that n*gga like, â€œChamp! Sit down, champ. Weâ€™ll get it. Weâ€™ll get it, champ. Weâ€™ll get it, champ.â€ You gotta call them old n*ggas champ to make them feel like they still got it. Itâ€™s all good, champ. You woulda got that shit up there if that bitch didnâ€™t pack up all them sequined sweaters and shit. Those sequins get heavy when theyâ€™re in bulk like that, champ. [crowd laughing] I would not be a gentleman for you until I get to know you. Point blank. Period. â€˜Cause you donâ€™t even know what the fuck you want, as a collective. You donâ€™t. Some women, you open the door for them, theyâ€™ll be like, â€œThank you so much.â€ Some women be like, â€œI can open the door!â€ Youâ€™ll be like, â€œBitch, go open the goddamn door!â€ [crowd laughing] Scaring me and shit. [crowd laughing] Gentlemen shit. Women judge men on what theyâ€™re do and donâ€™t do for them before you even know who we are! Cold game yâ€™all been running it for years. Gentlemen shit. Well, hell, there ainâ€™t no gentlewomen shit to do. Name some gentlewomen shit. Right.
[crowd laughing]
Hereâ€™s some gentlewomen shit yâ€™all can do. Just go to a random motherfucker and moisturize his hands. [crowd laughing] Yeah, thatâ€™ll work. N*gga talking, â€œYeah, I told that n*gga last nightâ€¦â€ [crowd laughing] â€œWell, thatâ€™s mighty sweet of you, Maâ€™am. Thank you very much.â€ [crowd laughing] Looking at the motherfucker, he likeâ€¦ â€œAha!â€ [crowd laughing] Gentlemen shit. What?! I gotta open the door for you, pull your chair out. If itâ€™s cold outside, I gotta take my jacket off and put it on you but I saw the weather and I knew it was 40 motherfucking degrees. [crowd laughing] So I brought a jacket. So now I gotta catch pneumonia â€™cause your goofy ass wonâ€™t watch the weather. [crowd laughing] I commend all you young folks out here to taking a stance in life on all kinds of shit like Black Lives Matter. Gay, trans, bi and all that shit. [crowd clapping] [whistling in crowd] I commend yâ€™all, man. It was instilled in our minds back in the day like, if you was gay or something like that, theyâ€™d beat your ass and shit if that shit was, if you was gay or whatever. Thereâ€™s a lot of people my age right now ainâ€™t living their truth because of the way that we was fucking raised and shit. Right now. Real shit. [crowd clapping] Wasnâ€™t nobody gay in my class. Wasnâ€™t nobody gay in my school. Wasnâ€™t nobody gay in my school district.
[crowd laughing]
Not that I know of. Yeah, wasnâ€™t nobody, like, hanging out like that. Man, the motherfuckers was like homophobic as fuck back in the day. I remember my mother took me to one of my uncleâ€™s houses to stay over there for the summer. This n*gga was homophobic as fuck. Had all these rules and shit. We get over there, this motherfuckerâ€™s like, [mimicking baritone voice] â€œYeah, uh, first of all, I got some rules and shit if you gonna stay here, you understand me? First of all, if you see something in my hair, you leave it there, motherfucker, alright? Donâ€™t no man pick shit out of another manâ€™s hair, you understand me? Thereâ€™s a feather in there, you leave that motherfucking feather in there. There could be a whole bird in my shit, you leave it in there, motherfucker. If thereâ€™s something in my eye, n*gga, you fix your lips to blow on my eye, Iâ€™ll rip your motherfucking mouth off. Donâ€™t no man blow on another manâ€™s eye. You let that motherfucker bleed to death, you understand me? If I catch you on your tippy-toes, Iâ€™m kicking you and your nuts. If you canâ€™t reach some shit, you get a broom or shoe trying to knock it down. If it donâ€™t fall, it ainâ€™t meant for you, n*gga. But I catch you on your tippy-toes, Iâ€™ll fuck you up, you understand that? You put cologne on in this house, n*gga, you spray that shit dead on your clothes. If you spray that shit in the air and walk through, n*gga, Iâ€™ll fuck you up. [crowd laughing] â€œN*gga, if I see this shitâ€¦ [hissing]
[crowd laughing] Iâ€™ll beat your ass, you understand me? And all the food you eat in this house better be solid as a rock, motherfucker. Donâ€™t you eat shit that ooze in your mouth, motherfucker. Ainâ€™t no Twinkies, jelly doughnuts, sunny-side up eggs, Halls Mentho-Lyptus, sucking on that Halls and it burst all in your mouth. You keep your cold, n*gga!â€ [crowd laughing] Look, Iâ€™m nine years old, like, [gasping] â€œArghâ€¦â€ [crowd laughing] All Iâ€™m saying to the younger generation is, â€œBe patient with us, being patient with you.â€ Alright? [crowd clapping] â€˜Cause I can only fathom what a motherfucker go through not living their truth and shit, you know. Being something that theyâ€™re not, you know. I can, I mean, I sympathize with people like that, you know. I remember one time, I read an article about me. That shit said, â€œDeon Cole is gay.â€ I was like, â€œWhat?!â€ It didnâ€™t say, â€œIs he gay?â€ â€œDeon Cole is gay,â€ like they had facts on this shit. Hey, motherfucker, I ainâ€™t never been gay, goddamn it. Closest I came to being gay was fucking a tomboy.
[crowd laughing, clapping]
That was my n*gga. [crowd laughing] That bitch was cold on the court, n*gga. That bitch was at a crossoverâ€¦ crossing over n*ggas, n*gga. Breaking n*ggas ankles out there, n*gga.

[crowd laughing] Anytime I do, I always go up to her and be like, â€œToday must be your first day.â€ [crowd laughing] [crowd continues laughing] When youâ€™re in a grocery store checkout line, whose job is it to put the grocery divider down? Is it the person thatâ€™s standing there, or the person that walks up because this is a very stressful moment. Go. [crowd laughing] The person standing there. Yeah, fuck that! Why fucking would I put the divider down and probably ainâ€™t nobody even behind me? It should be the job of the person that walks up to put the divider down to buy their groceries. [crowd laughing, cheering] Iâ€™m in line, this white dude come behind me like, [groaning] â€œUgh!â€ [crowd laughing] Iâ€™m like, â€œWait a minute, white n*gga, I ainâ€™t know that was my job to put that down.â€ Come over here stressing me out, white n*gga.

About an hour later, you notice a big knot in your pants, and itâ€™s your drawers from yesterday?
[crowd laughing]
â€œMy good drawers, too. I canâ€™t throw these away.â€ I just push them up by my dick until I get home. [crowd laughing] White people donâ€™t laugh at that joke â€™cause they wear their shit five days any goddamn week. [crowd laughing] Why do you guys do that? [crowd laughing] [Deon clears throat] I only call white people â€œguysâ€ â€™cause it makes them feel comfortable and shit. Yâ€™all n*ggas do it too at work. Put on your white voice and shit. [crowd laugh] â€œHey guys, weâ€™re going to lunch.â€ [crowd laughing] â€œYouâ€™re buying?â€ â€œThanks, guys.â€ [crowd laughing, some clapping] I never call Black people â€œguys.â€ Never call n*ggas â€œguys.â€ Like, â€œHey guys, wanna smoke a blunt?â€ [crowd laughing] [Deon sniffs] â€œWho the fuck you calling guys, n*gga?

[crowd continues laughing, muttering indistinctly] I was having sex with this girl and she screamed out, â€œDeeper!â€ And I said, â€œTighter!â€ And then, [crowd laughing] and then we both sat there, depressed, [crowd continues laughing] because we knew we werenâ€™t gonna get what we wanted. [crowd laughing and cheering] [continued cheering, whistling] [groans] Oh, man. Hereâ€™s a fun fact, pretty women are never in the way. Pretty women are never in the way.

Comedians be some hurt motherfuckers, man. We gotta put away everything thatâ€™s bothering us in order to come make yâ€™all happy and we not complaining. Itâ€™s part of the job. A boxer get hit, so thatâ€™s just the job and shit. But you never understand what the comic is going through. He has to constantly be doing this shit and being happy around everybody when his whole fucking world is caving the fuck in. And yâ€™all donâ€™t know that. Thatâ€™s a lot of hurt motherfucking comics out there. Me, personally? Iâ€™m coming out here doing the special and shit but this past year was hard for me, yâ€™all.

And I said to myself, â€œI want her name to ring and I want her to be out here and live through me.â€
[crowd cheering]
But hold on. That shit devastated me and Iâ€™ve been fucked up ever since. But when I come out here and I get love from yâ€™all, Iâ€™ll be good.

And motherfuckers close to 50 or at 50, we lose our parents â€™cause our parents is like 70 and 80 and shit. Thereâ€™s a lot of people going through the same thing Iâ€™m going through right now. Iâ€™m not normal, motherfucker, I promise you. And Iâ€™m trying to live normal every fucking day. Iâ€™m trying to find a new normal in this fucking world. But when you got people like that, and I know yâ€™all out there, I know you lost your parents, and Iâ€™m here to tell you, man, you ainâ€™t alone. Iâ€™m here for you as long as everybody else is too. And anybody that you see who lost their parents, you embrace them. Go try and make them still be normal as fuck, theyâ€™re not. They hurting, they crushed. And they lost. Just like me.
So I dedicate this to my mother, Charleen Cole. I love you to death, Ma. And thank yâ€™all, Brooklyn, I hope you had a wonderful time. I love you, Mommy. I miss you so much.
[crowd cheering]
And I thank yâ€™all Brooklyn, man. I appreciate yâ€™all, man.

[audience applauding]
[audience cheering]
All right, let me explain. Friend of mineâ€¦ â€œFormer friend,â€ weâ€™ll call her.
[audience laughter]
â€¦is an artist, right? And the theme of our friendship is kind of feeling alone in the world. Right? So I wrote this show, which is about that feeling. And I sent her the script and I was like, â€œHey, can you make a backdrop for me?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI got you.â€ And then two days ago, she sends me this. [audience laughter] Which feels less like alienation and more like a second grade speech therapistâ€™s office.
[audience laughter]
Iâ€™m like, â€œHow am I supposed to arrange these things?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, youâ€™ll figure it out.â€ [audience laughter] So, Iâ€™m going to be talking to you guysâ€¦ all night, but, Iâ€™m going to be preoccupied with trying to satisfy her. None of this should surprise me. Is your life going smoothly? [audience laughter] Are you just floating from event to event, feeling good about yourself? â€˜Cause Iâ€™m not. Most interactions I have feel like when you go to throw something away and itâ€™s in one of those garbage cans thatâ€™s got a garbage hole, a recycling hole, and a compost hole. You do your best, but after youâ€™re like, â€œI donâ€™t think I did that right.â€
[audience laughter]
Thatâ€™s how I feel most of the time. Going through life feeling like I fucked up, and Iâ€™m going to get in trouble. I worry that my final thought on Earth, on my deathbed, is going to be, â€œIs that nurse mad at me?â€ [imitates flatline beep]
[audience laughter]
These are technically the areas of my life that make me feel like somethingâ€™s wrong with me. Some of them are more important than others. We can start small. Weâ€™ll start with dogs. Right? So, I never had pets growing up, right? But I watch videos of dogs and theyâ€™re so funny and loving, and soldiers come back from overseas, the dogâ€™s freaking out, the soldierâ€™s freaking out, the dogâ€™s fucking his face. Iâ€™m like, you know what? I should get a dog. [audience laughter] So I get a pit bull named Keith. And um, everybody told me, â€œKeithâ€™s going to be your best friend.â€ And I gotta say, maybe my ninth-best friend.
[audience laughter]
Like, weâ€™re cool, but whatever that thing is that opens up between humans and animals just never opened up. And then I go, â€œDo I not understand human-dog relationships or am I the only person who understands human-dog relationships?â€ â€˜Cause everybody asks the same question, â€œIs he a rescue?â€ Yeah, theyâ€™re all rescues.
[audience laughter]
None of these dogs are thriving on their own.
[audience laughter]
Never heard a story like, â€œWhereâ€™d you get your Labradoodle?â€ â€œWent into Bank of America. She was the manager.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œNow sheâ€™s our full-time Labradoodle.â€ I shouldnâ€™t even say I rescued it. People love patting themselves on the back. â€œWe rescued it, saved it, adopted it.â€ No, you didnâ€™t. Hereâ€™s what happened to your dog, my dog, every dog. The dog was born into a litter, kidnapped, given to you.
[audience laughter]
â€œNo, Neal. You donâ€™t understand. Iâ€™m a dog mom.â€ Really? You know who else was a dog mom? That dogâ€™s mom.
[audience laughter]
[applause]
We think because we talk to dogs like theyâ€™re babies, theyâ€™re babies. Theyâ€™re not. Theyâ€™re our captives. Right? But we think because we go, â€œAre you a pretty girl?â€ Pitch your voice down. See what a monster you are. â€œAre you a pretty girl?â€
[audience laughter]
â€œWe can go outside. I have to put a chain around your neck.â€ [audience laughter] â€œDo a trick for me. Iâ€™ll give you a tiny morsel of food.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œYouâ€™re my best friend.â€
[audience laughter]
We try to make movies about it romanticizing the relationship, like Marley & Me. You know what a dog sees inÂ Marley & Me? He sees Taken, but Liam Neeson never shows up.
[audience laughter]
[sighs] And, by the way, I think itâ€™s my fault. Somethingâ€™s wrong with me. Uhâ€¦ So Iâ€™d read books about loving dogsâ€¦ Justâ€¦ Like, okay, so is this thingâ€¦ Is this for my LGBT joke? Or is she trying to tell me Iâ€™m on the spectrum? [audience laughter] Even groups youâ€™d think Iâ€™d feel like Iâ€™m a part of, I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m a part of.Â Likeâ€¦ liberals. Clearly liberal. Look at me. Bone-thin.
[audience laughter]
I look like Rachel Maddow with a beard. [audience laughter] But I donâ€™t feel like part of the group, â€™cause liberals are the least-welcoming people on the planet. Republicans are having a blast. Grabbing pussy, shooting guns like Westworld. [audience laughter] Republicans get to be greedy. Republicans care about themselves, their families, rich people, thatâ€™s it. Liberals got to care about everybody. Not fetuses.Â But everybody else. Am I right, liberals? [exclaiming] Fuck a fetus. Whoâ€™s with me, liberals?
[audience exclaiming]
I will punt a fetus down Wilshire if I see one. [audience laughter] The problem being liberal is thereâ€™s no amount of liberal thatâ€™s liberal enough. If thereâ€™s a bunch of Republicans and someone goes, â€œIâ€™m a Republican.â€ They go, â€œCome on in.â€ If thereâ€™s a bunch of liberals and a liberal goes, â€œHey, Iâ€™m liberal,â€ theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™ll see.â€ [audience laughter] You can believe the right shit as a liberal, but if you express it incorrectly, youâ€™re fucked. Itâ€™s terrifying. Ever try to talk about transgender issues in public? Even right now youâ€™re like, â€œWe donâ€™t gotta do this.â€ [audience laughter] â€œDonâ€™t go out like your boy. Just move on.â€
[audience laughter]
[audience cheering]
But thatâ€™s exactly my point. Itâ€™s terrifying. Iâ€™m sure we all believe the right shit, but you everâ€¦ Trying to talk about transgender issues in public is like playing conversational Jenga. Youâ€™re likeâ€¦ â€œPronounsâ€¦â€ â€œHeâ€¦ Theyâ€¦â€ Then Republicans are like, â€œTrannies? Weâ€™ll call â€™em trannies?â€ [thud] [audience laughter] â€œWhat happened here? You guys playing Jenga?â€ [audience laughter] â€œI fucking love Jenga. Rack â€™em up.â€ Thereâ€™s a lot of little conundrums as a liberal, right? Like, I live in Venice, California, in LA. [man whoops] Yeah. And thereâ€™s a lot of homeless people in Venice. But Iâ€™m from New York, so itâ€™s hard to take LA homeless people seriously. [audience laughter] Itâ€™s like once you work with the best, you know? [audience laughter] Soâ€¦ So one day I get home, and I got anâ€¦ email. Paper email. A letter, weâ€™ll call it. [audience laughter] The letter says, â€œWeâ€™re opening a homeless shelter.â€ As a liberal, thatâ€™s great. I keep reading. It says, â€œAcross the street from your house.â€ I was like, â€œOh shit.â€ [audience laughter] It was like being on a game show like How Liberal Are You? Like, â€œUhâ€¦â€
[audience laughter]
â€œI wrote a Black TV show.â€ [audience laughter] Yeah. My neighbors want to protest and shit. Iâ€™m not going to protest. Iâ€™m going to move. But Iâ€™m not going toâ€¦ [audience laughter] No, I didnâ€™t move. They opened the shelter. Itâ€™s not bad. Itâ€™s fine. How Liberal Are You? would be a funny game show, wouldnâ€™t it? â€œYouâ€™re at an airport and a Muslim-looking man asks you to watch his luggage while he prays.â€ How Liberal Are You? [audience laughter] â€œPass!â€ [audience laughter] You know whoâ€™s a liberal conundrum, as a person? Kanye. Yeah, â€™cause when Kanye first started, he said, â€œGeorge Bush doesnâ€™t care about Black people.â€ Conservatives were like, â€œHe needs to shut the fuck up.â€ Liberals were like, â€œLet him speak.â€ Then he started saying how much he liked Trump and liberals were like, â€œHe does need to shut the fuck up.â€
[audience laughter]
People at this point are just exhausted by Kanye. People are like, â€œThat guyâ€™s fucking crazy.â€ Yeah. No kidding. Heâ€™s a rapper. Since when do you rely on rappers for their emotional stability? [audience laughter] Whatâ€™s your argument?Â â€œBack in my day, there was a guy named Flavor Flav.â€ [audience laughter] â€œAnd heâ€™d walk around and say, â€˜You know what time it is!'â€ â€œAnd we did know. He had a fucking giant clock on his chest.â€ [audience laughter] â€œThere was another fella named DMX whoâ€™d smoke crack and bark at people.â€ [audience laughter] â€œHeâ€™d goâ€¦â€ [barks] â€œAnd we knew where he stood.â€
[audience laughter] â€œHis bark was as good as his word.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œThere was another named Eminem whoâ€™d make albums about murdering his wife.â€ â€œThese are normal people we are talking about.â€ This. Maybe sheâ€™ll like this. Yeah, guns. I lose liberals on guns. I would like to, before I talk about this, say that I am afraid of guns, but it turns out the cops are too. [chuckles]
[audience cheering and applauding]
Whatâ€™s the lesson weâ€™re supposed to learn from Uvalde? Right? From Uvalde, Texas. Are we supposed to justâ€¦ Itâ€™s always got to be a good guy with a gun? Thatâ€™s the only way to stop it? Right? Everyoneâ€¦ The whole countryâ€™s going to be good guys with guns. Everywhere you go, â€œFreeze!â€ â€œYou freeze!â€ â€œIâ€™m already frozen!â€ Just fuckingâ€¦ [audience laughter] Also, if itâ€™s up to us to stop guns, you know, speeding kills thousands of people every year. Are we supposed to stop that too? Weâ€™re supposed to run them off the road? If we see a speeder coming up, â€œYou know what they say, the only thing that stops bad guy in a car is a good guy in a car.â€ Neew!
[audience laughter]
Yeah, my problem with guns is I donâ€™t buy either sideâ€™s arguments completely. So the conservative argument is that guns are in the Constitution because the Founding Fathers thought if the citizens have guns the government will do what they say or else the people will rise up and fight the government. Which is a legitimately great idea in the 1700s, butâ€¦ problem is, thereâ€™s still people now hoarding weapons thinking that, at some point, they may need to take on the American military, and they think they have a shot, right? [audience laughter] And look, maybe theyâ€™re right, which is why Iâ€™m proposing we test their theory, and once a year have a head-to-head showdown. [audience laughing, cheering] Say 100 members of the NRA versus, I donâ€™t know, two members of the military. [audience laughter] Broadcast it on Fox, Christmas Day.
[audience laughter]
â€œMerry Christmas and welcome to the 2022 NRA-Military Showdown.â€ â€œLetâ€™s go down to the field of battle, meet one of our NRA combatants.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s your name? What kind of weapon?â€ â€œMy nameâ€™s Andy Baker, and I got an AR-15, wearing Kevlar head-to-toe.â€ â€œHow confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10?â€ â€œFuckinâ€™ a million.â€ [audience laughter] â€œWeâ€™re going to check in with the military.â€ They cut to one guy by himself, in a bunker, and heâ€™s like, â€œMy name is Staff Sgt.Â Jeremiah Walker.â€ â€œWhat kind of weapon are you working with?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know if this is fair, but Iâ€™m working with a drone.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œItâ€™s equipped with eight Hellfire missiles and a high-power camera.â€ â€œAs you can see on this monitor, the NRA fellas are in one big cluster.â€ [audience laughter] â€œSo, Iâ€™m going toâ€¦â€ â€œWe started? All right.â€ [audience laughter] â€œYeah, so Iâ€™m going to hit this button right here.â€ [audience laughter] â€œYeah, now theyâ€™re all dead.â€ [audience laughter] â€œThatâ€™ll do it for this yearâ€™s NRA-Military Showdown.â€ [audience cheering and clapping] â€œBrought to you by Whole Foods.â€ [audience laughter] You know the NRA guys would be like, â€œWe can take â€™em next year. Just got to split up.â€
[audience laughter]
Thatâ€™s the conservative argument, and the liberal argument is that, uh, the gun stats in America are just horrifying, right? And they are on their face, right? 40,000 gun deaths a year. Which is awful. But, you know what they never tell you? You know how many of those are suicides? Two-thirds are suicides. No one ever knows that. So whenever thereâ€™s a mass shooting on television, which are legitimately tragic, liberals always run on TV and say, â€œWe donâ€™t need mental health care. We need common-sense gun control.â€ No. How about both? Right? How about one question at the point of sale? Find out whoâ€™s depressed, who isnâ€™t, and two-thirds of gun deaths right there. Guy comes in and they go, â€œBefore we sell you this weapon, can we just look at your browser history real quick?â€ [audience laughter] He goes, â€œSir, youâ€™ve been listening to Lana Del Rey.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œAnd staring at pictures of your ex. Weâ€™re not going to give you a gun today, but we are going to give you a bag of mushrooms and a copy of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.â€ [audience laughter] [audience clapping and cheering] â€œYouâ€™re gonna be back on your feet and talking with your butt cheeks in no time.â€ [audience laughter] So now weâ€™re down to about 13,000 gun deaths a year, which is atrocious. But, by the way, you know how many people the flu kills in the average year? 50,000. If youâ€™re worried youâ€™ll be murdered by a gun, think about how scared you are of dying from the fluâ€¦ Youâ€™re not. â€¦divide it by three, and Iâ€™ll meet you there. By the way, do you see how I think myself into isolated, asshole-y positions? About everything for as long as I can remember. Even I hear myself sometimes and Iâ€™m like, â€œJust shut the fuck up.â€ I got to be the only person who was ever asked, â€œWould you rather be right or happy?â€ And I was likeâ€¦ â€œUghâ€¦â€ [audience laughter] Somethingâ€™s wrong with me. And, by the way, I work against all myÂ instincts with this. You know, I give to every liberal group you can think of. I give to so manyâ€¦ I give to an anti-capitalist group. How fucking dumb is that? And they have the balls to hit me up for donations. â€œCan we get another 100 bucks for our anti-capitalism group?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBut you know how Iâ€™m getting this money, donâ€™t you?â€ [audience laughter] Oh yeah. Maybe youâ€™re thinking like, â€œNeal, why donâ€™t you smoke some weed?â€ â€œChill the fuck out.â€ Thatâ€™s not up there â€™cause I love weed. Thatâ€™s up there â€™cause I donâ€™t think recreational drugs work on me right. Like MDMA. Molly, ecstasy, depending how old you are.
[audience laughter]
Uhâ€¦ Iâ€¦ Iâ€™ve done it seven or eight times. Never worked on me once. Thereâ€™s people whose brains donâ€™t respond to MDMA. Guess I have one of those brains. My friends do not have one of those brains. That was pretty awkward. Theyâ€™re all rubbing each otherâ€™s nipples, and Iâ€™m just likeâ€¦ [fake laughter] [audience laughter] Yeah, and I donâ€™t think weed works on me either. Unless, is weed supposed to make you violently paranoid for five minutes, then you got to go to sleep? Is that weed? [audience laughter] â€˜Cause in that case,Â bullâ€™s-eye. I feel bad too because weâ€™re living in the golden age of weed. Weed is legal in so many places. Itâ€™s legal out here. Uhâ€¦ They sponsor comedy shows, so I get bags and vapes and pipes. I have so much weed at my house that I cannot use, Iâ€™ve become like an old lady with a lemon tree in her backyard. Iâ€™m like, â€œTake some weed.â€ [audience laughter] So weedâ€™s legal. Shrooms just got legalized in Denver, Oakland, all of Oregon. Yeah. Yeah.
[audience cheering]
So thereâ€™s going to be shroom stores. You ready? Youâ€™ll go to a shroom store and go, â€œYou open?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know, are you open?â€ [audience laughter] Iâ€™m not mad at these drugs. MDMA, psilocybin, weed all passed the FDA hurdles for safety. Uh, but you know what wouldnâ€™t pass the FDA hurdles for safety? Alcohol. For safety? Like, if they tested out whiskey in a lab. 100 men, 100 women, scientists dispensing it, marking down the results, they go to their boss. â€œSir, we did the whiskey test.â€ â€œUh, first one or two drinks, people seemed warm and happy.â€ â€œThen around the third drink, a lot of the men became belligerent.â€ â€œThe women were upset, but they said they didnâ€™t want to talk about it.â€ [audience laughter] â€œAnd then a lot of people vomited and passed out, and everyone who drove home crashed their car.â€ [audience laughter] â€œThat sounds awful.â€ â€œI know, hereâ€™s the crazy part.â€ â€œThey all want to come back again on Saturday.â€ [audience laughter] â€œTheyâ€™re wondering if we can hire a DJ.â€ â€œAnd two Israeli guys want to promote it. Does thatâ€¦?â€
[audience laughter]
So clearly Iâ€™m not a big drinker. The fucked-up thing about alcohol is it gets so much good PR. Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve always heard, â€œWhen you drink, your real self comes out.â€ Which is true to a point. Maybe one or two drinks. But Iâ€™ve never looked at one of my sloshed friends and been, â€œThereâ€™s the real Tony.â€ And theyâ€™re, â€œUgh!â€ [grunting] â€œFuck you guys!â€ â€œThat is his God-given essence, right there.â€ [exclaims] The real Tony has to piss on the street. [audience laughter] Yeah, not a big drinker. Not a big smoker. People donâ€™t like it. It is good for me. Not drinking and smoking. I know itâ€™s good for me because when I tell people at parties, they say, â€œGood for you,â€ right before they walk away.
[audience laughter]
But alcohol is hard. Itâ€™s a tough issue for me â€™cause I grew up with an alcoholic dad, right? Uhâ€¦ and, you know, people love alcohol, and women are people. Soâ€¦ [audience laughter] Admit it. Umâ€¦ And so dating is tough because I donâ€™t want to be a drink cop, but at the same time, it can be a little triggering. Sometimes itâ€™s fine. Other times itâ€™s like, â€œMmm, trauma.â€ Umâ€¦
[audience laughing and clapping]
Yeah, but I donâ€™t know what I can ask for within this, right? Like, I just donâ€™t know whatâ€™sâ€¦ I go, â€œWho am I to tell her not to drink?â€ â€œAs someone whoâ€™s trying to protect themselves?â€ â€œFrom what?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know, a negative emotional experience? The smell of alcohol?â€ â€œAre you not fucking over that? How are you not fucking over that?â€ So Iâ€™ve just got this negative tape running in my head about that and pretty much most things in my life. I have a veryâ€¦ I got a bad inner monologue. I wrote it down one time, and as soon as I saw it, I was like, I got to erase this. Because if any of my friends know that someoneâ€™s talking to me like this, theyâ€™re going to be pissed. But meanwhile, it was an inside job, you know? You ever look back on your life and think the way you are is inevitable? If you donâ€™t know much about me, Iâ€™m the youngest of ten kids, which isâ€¦ too many. Right? Both my parents were born during the Great Depression, and they were nice enough to bring it with them. [audience laughter] Yeah, so both my parents brought that energy to their union, and it was just a lot of chaos and alcohol and law and order. Like, a lot of violence. My earliestâ€¦ One of my earliest memories of life is watching my teenage brother fistfight my dad on the front lawn. Itâ€™s like, â€œOkay, so this is life.â€ Umâ€¦ Yeah, just so many rules. Just constant rules. There were so many rules that eventually my mother wrote the important ones down and stuck them on the wall of the kitchen, like youâ€™d see at a steel factory. My friend actually put them on here. Iâ€™ll tell you about some of them. Bunch of TV rules, which I guess makes sense. A lot of laundry rules. My mother was laundry-room crazy. Um, if you left your clothes in the laundry room for too long, my mother would confiscate your clothes. Disappeared, Khmer Rouge-style. [audience chuckling] Never to be seen again. Although one year for Christmas, my sister Anne did get a keychain, a candle, and a box of her old clothes back, soâ€¦ Merry Christmas, Anne. Why are you crying?
[audience laughter]
A lot of sandwich rules. You guys probably all had sandwich rules, right? [audience laughter] We had to make all ofâ€¦ There were too many of us. We couldnâ€™t all make sandwiches every morning before school, so weâ€™d have to make them in bulk on the weekend and then stick them in the freezer. And then on the way to school, we grabbed one of our sandwiches. Youâ€™re thinking that must not have made for very fresh sandwiches, but youâ€™re forgetting a more important piece of information. Sandwiches donâ€™t always thaw between 8:00 a.m. and lunchtime. [audience laughter] In those cases, weâ€™d eat around the edges like rats on a pirate ship. [audience laughter] So, pretty much the Gilmore Girls is what Iâ€™m saying. Yeah, so I grew up Catholic. Anybody else? [cheering] Yeah, I did all the Catholic milestones. Baptism, First Holy Communion, Confirmation, atheism. Right?
[audience laughter]
[applause]
I shouldnâ€™t even say Iâ€™m an atheist. Letâ€™s say Iâ€™m agnostic about my atheism, right? Atheists are such smug hypocrites, by the way. Atheists will be like, â€œYou pray to a god? Thatâ€™s so silly.â€ â€œCan I show you my vision board real quick?â€ [audience laughter] I know a lot of white atheists. I donâ€™t know many Black atheists. Not none, just not many. I got a theory about why thereâ€™s not many Black atheists. Here goes. Atheism is really like the height of white privilege. It really is. Religion says, â€œCan we interest you in an afterlife?â€ And white people are like, â€œNo, thank you.â€ [chuckles] [audience laughter] â€œHow much better could it be?â€ [audience laughter] â€œIâ€™ll just take my supplements and see what happens.â€ White privilege has had a big couple years, huh? Yeah. The Cauckies, the Caucasians. [audience laughter] Cauckies were blindsided in 2020. They were just caught unawares, right? I was talking to a white lady. She says, â€œI had no idea things were so bad between Black people and the police.â€ I was like, â€œThereâ€™s no way you couldâ€™ve, unless you listen to any song by a Black person, ever.â€ [audience laughter] Like, what do you think â€œFuck tha Policeâ€ was about, lady? â€œI didnâ€™t think it was all police. I thought it was one precinct.â€ How about Bob Marleyâ€™s â€œI Shot the Sheriffâ€? â€œI know, but he didnâ€™t shoot the deputy, soâ€¦â€
[audience laughter]
I like the white privilege thatâ€™s hiding in plain sight. You know whatâ€™s a white privilege thing thatâ€™s hiding? A lot of American city names are white privilege. Like Chicago, Milwaukee, those are Native American words. West Coast is wild. San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego. Spanish names. Ever think about why theyâ€™re Spanish? Wellâ€¦ â€˜Cause we jacked the motherfuckers from Mexico, didnâ€™t even bother changing the names.
[audience laughter]
That is some ice-cold white privilege shit. Thatâ€™d be like if your boy Pete had a girlfriend for years. â€œPeteâ€™s girl.â€ Then you steal her, take her to a party, youâ€™re like, â€œYou know my girl Peteâ€™s girl, donâ€™t you?â€ [audience laughter] â€œYou thirsty, baby? Get Peteâ€™s girl a drink, would you?â€ â€œI got you a necklace with your initials on it. PG. Peteâ€™s girl.â€ You know whatâ€™s white privilege? Joking about race. Thatâ€™s white privilege. â€˜Cause as a white person, it just bounces right off. Right? I know the funniest, meanest Black dudes in the world. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œWhite people canâ€™t dance. No rhythm.â€ Iâ€™ll be like, â€œWho needs rhythm when you own the record label?â€
[audience laughter]
[audience continues laughing]
Am I TikToking? Be honest. Is this TikTok? [audience laughter] A lot of Cauckies ask me, they go, â€œNealâ€¦â€ â€œNeal, Iâ€™m a good Cauckie. What can I do?â€ â€œHow can I combat white privilege?â€ Acknowledge it as itâ€™s happening to you. This happened to me recently. I got pulled over doing 73 in a 35. So it was tight. [audience laughter] And white cop. I get my license and registration. Heâ€™s back running my plates, and Iâ€™m sitting there going, â€œI deserve whatever. A fine or a ticket.â€ â€œWhatever Iâ€™m going to get, I totally deserve.â€ He comes back. Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ll let you off with a warning.â€ Iâ€™m like, no, thatâ€™s fucked up. â€˜Cause I know my Black or brown friends would at least be getting a ticket. I gotta say something. I was like, â€œDonâ€™t be stupid. Heâ€™s a cop.â€ I was like, â€œNo, nowâ€™s the time.â€ And I said, â€œThanks, officer. Itâ€™s been a white privilege.â€
[audience laughter]
He said, â€œThe privilege is all white.â€ What the fuck? [audience laughter] Race is another oneÂ of these issues thatâ€™s a weird one for me, â€™cause itâ€™s had an oddly big effect on my life. Not anywhere near a person of color, but 50 times the average Cauckie. Uhâ€¦ [audience chuckles] And Iâ€™m good at writing racial jokes, and Iâ€™m like, is it my place to tell them? Like, if they fall into the wrong handsâ€¦ Like, that â€œwho needs rhythm when you own the record labelâ€ joke, that would crush at a Klan rally. Crush.
[audience laughter]
You can hear it. â€œSo I said, â€˜Who needs rhythm when you own the record label?'â€ â€œGood night. My nameâ€™s Jedediah.â€ [audience laughter] So itâ€™s like, should I not tell the jokes in public? Like, I know what my intentions are, but, like, who gives a shit what my intentions are if theyâ€™reâ€¦ misinterpreted? Pretty accessible comedy show, huh, folks? [audience laughter] Iâ€™m in a tiny theater, moralizing about race. Meanwhile, Kevin Hartâ€™s in an arena, â€œI tell you about the time I went to Egypt and a camel bit me in the dick?â€
[audience laughter]
Somethingâ€¦ Somethingâ€™s wrong with me. Oh, you know what? I think this is a womanâ€™s shoe. You might be thinking like, â€œNeal, if you got married and had kids some of yourâ€¦ alienation might dissipate.â€ Maybe. I donâ€™t know. Never been married. Donâ€™t have kids. 48 years old. People donâ€™t like it. [audience laughter] Itâ€™s worse for women if youâ€™re over a certain age. Not married, no kids, people pity you. But as a guy, people are suspicious. [audience laughter] I would get more trust from women if Iâ€™d been married and murdered my wife. [audience laughter] Theyâ€™d be like, â€œHeâ€™s capable of love. He gets too passionate.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œAlso, heâ€™s not going to murder two people.â€ [audience laughter] Cute. Yeah, itâ€™s notâ€¦ Iâ€™veâ€¦ Iâ€™ve been in long-term relationships. Been in love a few times. It just never got to marriage. It just never got there. These are big risks, these relationships, â€™causeâ€¦ â€™causeâ€¦ Youâ€™re basically just doing a daily trust fall with somebody, right? Every day youâ€™d be like, â€œOkay. Your turn. Okay, here we go.â€ Aah! â€œOh my God, this is so fun. Do me.â€ â€œOkay, here we go. I got you.â€ Aah! â€œOh my God, I feel so connected to you. Weâ€™re so lucky.â€ â€œDo me again.â€ Aah! [thud] Iâ€™ve hurt people as the catcher, and Iâ€™ve been hurt as the faller. They both suck for different reasons. The thing with these relationships is, you just have to believe in each other and assure one another, like, â€œWe both feel the same way.â€ â€œI feel the same about you as you do me. Weâ€™re connected, weâ€™re connected.â€ And then a certain point, they look at you and go, â€œOh, Iâ€™ve been pretending.â€ â€œWeâ€™reâ€¦ weâ€™reâ€¦ weâ€™re not connected.â€ And then you have to parse the relationship to try to figure out when they started pretending. And then eventually accept the fact that some of the most cherished memories of your life may have been a grift. Shitâ€™s breathtaking. I judge myself a lot for this. This is where Iâ€™m like, â€œSomething really is wrong with you.â€ You know, other comedians judge me for it. I was talking to a comedian friend. Heâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™d be more popular if you were married with kids.â€ I said, â€œWhy?â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œThe audience trusts you more if youâ€™re married with kids â€™cause youâ€™re moral.â€ â€œYou put other people ahead of you.â€ Uh, which Iâ€™ve legally never done. I have a dog. Youâ€™re like, â€œWhich one? The one you donâ€™t love?â€ Fuck you guys.
[audience laughter]
Iâ€™m not telling you shit anymore. But I get how, as an audience member, you trust comedians more if theyâ€™re married with kids. I do have one follow-up question. How is Bill Cosbyâ€™s marriage? Any word? [audience cheering] Is Louis C.K. still happily married? Heâ€™s fucking hilarious. He must be married. I had one more, and I need you guys to give it to me straight. John Mulaney? [audience exclaiming] Donâ€™t fucking â€œohâ€ me. I went to the goddamn wedding. [audience laughter] Yeah. I donâ€™t know what you spent. I had to fly across country, rent a car. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWanna upgrade for $30?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œItâ€™s Mulaneyâ€™s wedding. Letâ€™s blow it out.â€ Cut to me in a PT Cruiser going, â€œWas this an upgrade?â€
[audience laughter]
Well, at least Woody Allenâ€™s marriage is still flourishing, huh? [audience clapping] Did you see that documentary? Allen v. Farrow? Uh, they lay out the case pretty conclusively that before he married his stepdaughter Soon-Yi, he molested his other stepdaughter. And I got to say, itâ€™s probably my least favorite Woody Allen movie. [audience laughter] My failure in relationships is not for lack of trying, I swear to God. Like, Iâ€™ve done different approaches, love language, attachment style. Age, race, weight, job. I dated a model. Thank you.
[audience laughter]
Guys, dating a model is like owning a dune buggy. Dating a modelâ€™s like owning a dune buggy â€™cause at the beach, itâ€™s great. But everywhere else, youâ€™re like, â€œI shouldnâ€™t have brought you here.â€ [audience laughter] [audience cheering] By the way, this is all going to be heterosexual. Like, I donâ€™t have any gay insights. Never been gay. I check once a year. [audience laughter] I do. If youâ€™re honest, check once a year. I go on Pornhub, I click the â€œgayâ€ button, and I go, â€œAnything?â€ â€œAll right, back to women.â€
[audience laughter]
While I havenâ€™t been gay, I have experienced a ton of homophobia â€™cause I have a bidet. [audience laughter] My straight guy friends will be like, â€œCanâ€™t do it, bro.â€ â€œCanâ€™t have water shooting up my ass.â€ Are you worried aboutâ€¦ Look, if the only thing keeping you from being gay is water hitting your assâ€¦ [audience laughter] â€¦you are gay. [audience laughter] Just be gay. Come on over, take a ride on the pony, start your new life. Thatâ€™s how rudimentary guysâ€™ understanding of our sexuality is. Weâ€™re like, â€œI just got to protect the flag.â€ â€œAnd everythingâ€™s the same.â€ Fellas, no, you donâ€™t. Iâ€™m 48. The flagâ€™s been violated or whatever. Iâ€™ve had a couple fingers in the butt. From women. Nothing happened. Nothing changed. I wasnâ€™t like, â€œMy identity!â€
[audience laughter]
â€œEverything I thought I was!â€ [audience laughter] â€œTurn off Rogan, turn on Drag Race.â€ [audience laughter] You know what the first thing that always left in my relationships? Uh, appreciation for one another. Right? It happens in most relationships. We stop appreciating each other. Women start thinking, â€œMen are so thoughtless and stupid.â€ And men think, â€œWomen are so fussy and high-maintenance.â€ And weâ€™re both right. Women, you are fussy and high-maintenance. You know what else? Theyâ€™re sophisticated and elegant, and can make emotional connections including, get this, direct eye contact. Womenâ€™s spirit is just elevating. They can transform a room with their presence and energy. Iâ€™m thankful thereâ€™s women here tonight. If there were no women here tonight, fellas, with just all dudes in a dark room staring at meâ€¦ [audience laughter] â€¦you know what the energy would be? Proud Boys, and you know it. [audience laughter] Just a bunch of guys in cut-off leather gloves and wearing their horrible sunglasses like this for some reason.
[audience laughter]
And women, you think men are thoughtless and stupid, and we are. But you know what else we are? Fucking hilarious. [audience laughing and applauding] We are. Weâ€™re very funny. Women are beautifully constructive, and men are hilariously destructive. Right? If you ever go to an all-womenâ€™s event, itâ€™s just a bunch of women making eye contact and drinking white wine. [makes high-pitched sound] Eventually youâ€™re like, â€œI gotta get the fuck out of here.â€ Right? But usually guys show up to kind of ground the energy, and weâ€™re there, weâ€™re trying toâ€¦ Weâ€™re always trying to impress. Weâ€™re buying you shit, weâ€™re break dancingâ€¦ [audience laughter] â€¦doing magic tricks, backflips. Weâ€™re telling stories with sound effects. â€œThen I punched him in the stomach.â€ Pssh! Then he took out a machine gun.â€ Trrrr! Iâ€™ve never heard a woman do a sound effect in my entire life. [audience applauds] Noisesâ€¦ Like birdsâ€™ chirps, meows, shit you could do. Weâ€™re always trying to make you laugh. We got funny mean nicknames for our friends. â€œThis is Mike, aka Boner Mike.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œAka Illiterate Mike.â€ I never heard a woman be like, â€œThis is Sarah, aka Barren Sarah.â€ [audience laughter] â€œSheâ€™s so dry down there, we call her Sahara.â€ [audience laughter] [audience laughing and whopping] [audience laughter] [sniffles] I just donâ€™t have any like, real innate skill for being a boyfriend. Like, Iâ€™m thankful that thereâ€™s not an entrance exam to become a boyfriend â€™cause I would fail that shit miserably. The woman would come with the results. â€œAll right.â€ â€œWeâ€™re not going to pass you. I think you knew that.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œCouple areas in which you didnâ€™t do well, one of them was listening.â€ â€œUm, question was, â€˜If youâ€™re watching basketball on TV and your girlfriend needed to speak to you,Â how would you handle it?â€™ We were looking for, â€˜Turn the TV off, and ask what was going on, â€˜ but you wrote down, â€˜Iâ€™d turn the TV up.â€™ [audience laughter] â€˜And say, â€œI canâ€™t talk right now, babe. Itâ€™s the first quarter, which is one of the most important quarters.â€â€˜
[audience laughter]
â€œYou also did poorly in conflict resolution.â€ â€œThe question was, â€˜If she had an issue with something you did, how would you deal with it?â€™ And you wrote down, â€˜Iâ€™d think of a time she did something similar, and say, â€œSee, bitch? Now weâ€™re even.â€â€˜ [audience laughter] Back to the apps for you, my friend. Yeah, somethingâ€™s wrong with me, likeâ€¦ The other thing Iâ€™m not dying to get into with relationships is the power dynamic. â€˜Cause I feel like men had all the power for 400,000 years, give or take. And about six years ago, women were like, â€œMay we?â€ [audience laughter] I shouldnâ€™t say men have no power. I should be more specific. Liberal white men have no power in relationships. At this period in history, as a liberal white man, you now have to go to protests against myself. Understand?
[audience laughter]
Iâ€¦ [applause] When the George Floyd protests broke out, I was like, â€œIâ€™ll get my sign from the Womenâ€™s March. Here.â€ â€œI am the problem!â€ [audience laughter] I went to the Womenâ€™s March. It was inspiring on the one hand, and I also saw the funniest thing Iâ€™ve ever seen, right? So, inspiring, 400,000 women, their husbands, boyfriends, sons, dads, all together, marching for a cause. That was incredible. And then I also saw the funniest shit ever, uhâ€¦ We all had signs that we made, right? And there was another guy there, and he had a sign that said, â€œThis is what a feminist looks like,â€ with an arrow pointing at him. He and I are walking along, we make eye contact, the guy looks up at his sign and goesâ€¦ [audience laughter] So weâ€™ll see what happens. [audience chuckling]
[man] Oh, my God.
[chuckling] Yeah, Iâ€™ve dated aÂ lot of women that were correctors. I had two different girlfriends in my life say in front of me, â€œI trained him.â€ [audience muttering] â€œI taught him.â€ Yeah. Ever hear a guy say that? No, â€™cause you donâ€™t know any pimps. [audience laughter] [chuckling] Yeah. And you do teach us shit, women, but itâ€™s never shit we want to know. Shit you want us to know. Never had a girlfriend be like, â€œLet me show you how to choke a wolf.â€ [audience laughter] Itâ€™s always girly shit that you want us to know, and then we go, [in squeaky voice] â€œOh yeah.â€ [audience laughter] Thatâ€™s the sound of a guy learning shit he does not care about in the slightest. â€œOh yeah.â€ [audience laughter] â€œDuvet cover, yeah.â€ [audience laughter] â€œYeah, a blanket should have its own pouch.â€ [audience laughter] â€œThank you, babe.â€ Happens to all guys, all over the world. Age, race, class. Doesnâ€™t matter. We all know what happened with Meghan Markle and Harry Potter. Right? Is that his name?
[audience laughter]
We know what happened. She came home and was like, â€œI know weâ€™re in England, youâ€™re a prince, but your family sucks, so letâ€™s go to America and youâ€™re a fucking nobody.â€ And he was likeâ€¦ â€œOh yeah.â€ [audience laughter] â€œFuck a thousand years of tradition. Thanks, babe.â€ So much in relationships is luck. Thatâ€™s the thing nobody talks about. Itâ€™s luck. So this is the thing I looked up. So thereâ€™s a one-in-eight chance that you will marry somebody youâ€™re dating. Thereâ€™s a 50-50 chance the marriage will work. So, in essence, there is a 6% chance that youâ€™ll be in an everlasting loving relationship with someone youâ€™re dating, even if theyâ€™re great and youâ€™re great. 6%. Thatâ€™s luck. And I know I need to pause the show right now and let all the guys that are here on dates look at your lady and let her know that you guys are the exception.
[audience laughter]
[man] Whoo!
Youâ€™re going all the way. I get it. But 6%. Itâ€™s luck, right? Even if Iâ€™m wrong itâ€™s 9, but itâ€™s 6. Itâ€™s luck. Weâ€™re allâ€¦ We all judge each other for our failures at relationships. We judge ourselves. We should have empathy. Weâ€™re all basically just fans at an NBA game taking a half-court shot. When those fans miss the shot, everyone goes, â€œAww!â€ They donâ€™t go, â€œFuck you!â€ [audience laughter] â€œThink about why you missed that shot.â€ â€œStart with your relationship with your mother and go forward from there.â€ [audience laughter] And then, babies. Iâ€™m not anti-baby. [audience chuckles] Iâ€™m anti-fetus. Yâ€™all know Iâ€™m anti-fetus. [audience laughter] I fucking hate fetuses. I fucking hate them. I wish a fetus would step to me. [audience laughter] Yeah, so, I gottaâ€¦ Iâ€™ve just never looked down and been like, â€œI should reproduce this.â€ â€œRun it back. Letâ€™s go.â€ You know what TV show made me wary of having kids? You guys ever see that show, the nightly news?
[audience laughter]
Alright, climate change is a nightmare. Weâ€™re already double what Earthâ€™s population should be. I canâ€™t remember this much anger or division in my life. Having a kid right now would be like being at a house party, itâ€™s packed with people, you canâ€™t move, roofâ€™s on fire, basementâ€™s flooding, cops are coming, you look at your friend and youâ€™re like, â€œWe should invite Brian.â€
[audience laughter]
The problem is I gotta tell women on first dates I wonâ€™t have babies. I guess I donâ€™t have to. It just seems nicer, right? Because women have weird timing with that shit. I was on a date with a girl and sheâ€™s like, â€œI am 40.â€ â€œI need to start thinking about who Iâ€™m going to have kids with.â€ I was like, â€œStart thinking?â€ [audience laughter] â€œMiss, we may be down to minutes.â€ [audience laughter] Yeah, I got to tell women on first dates that I donâ€™t want to have kids. People donâ€™t like it. Telling a woman on a first date is like going to a job interview and being like, â€œJust so you know, I donâ€™t fuck with computers.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œHow do you want to do this?â€ Maybe itâ€™s luck. Maybe itâ€™s timing. Or, you know, could be both. Or maybe itâ€™s me. Maybe somethingâ€™s wrong with me. Maybe Iâ€™m too cranky, or wounded, or misogynistic. Or something I donâ€™t even know I am. You know what I realized? [woman] Itâ€™s not you. Itâ€™s not me? Well, good. Letâ€™s end the show. Good night, everybody. [audience laughter] [chuckles] Women, do you see the kind of belief Iâ€™m looking for? Just a little? Yeah, like, I had the thought recently that I donâ€™t think I can guarantee a womanâ€™s emotional safety. And Iâ€™m not sure she could guarantee mine. I wish that were not the case, but thatâ€™s just how I feel. And people go, â€œWell, donâ€™t you get lonely?â€ Yeah. But also, Iâ€™ve never been lonelier than in a relationship I didnâ€™t want to be in. [audience applauds] And then with kidsâ€¦ You know, I say itâ€™s climate changeâ€¦ Itâ€™s not. Secret, itâ€™s not. [audience laughter] I say itâ€™s all that stuff, but itâ€™s about the emotional connection â€™cause I donâ€™t want the kid to come out, and I donâ€™t feel it. We all know what happened with Keith.
[audience laughter]
And more importantly, my dad had ten kids, didnâ€™t love any of us, right? So I donâ€™t want toâ€¦ Iâ€™m half him, so I could repeat that all over again. And people are like, â€œYouâ€™d be such a good dad.â€ Iâ€™d be a good Marine too. I donâ€™t want to be a Marine. Like, people go, â€œWell, try.â€ Itâ€™s notâ€¦ â€œTake the leap.â€ Itâ€™s not my risk, itâ€™s their risk. They bear all the risk, right? â€˜Cause if youâ€™re born with a parent who doesnâ€™t love you, you spend your whole life thinking somethingâ€™s wrong with you. Iâ€¦ I also got to say, I really resent the pressure weâ€™re all under to do it. I really resent it. Right? Thereâ€™s dozens of new gender and sexual orientations. Thereâ€™s still only one relationship orientation. Toward marriage. â€œWhat about polyamory?â€ Thereâ€™s no tax cuts for polyamory. Stop it. But people are really impressed with like, â€œWe got married and signed a license.â€ â€œA marriage license? Howâ€™d you do it?â€
[audience laughter]
A legal yoke isnâ€™t that impressive to me. You know what I mean? Whatâ€™s more meaningful? A bird in a cage? Or a bird that flies away every day and comes back just â€™cause they like being birds with you? Isnâ€™t that better?
[audience applauds]
People say stuff like, â€œWellâ€¦â€ Just the dumb shit. â€œIf you donâ€™t marry her, you wonâ€™t be able to visit her in the hospital after hours.â€ [audience laughter] I will if I give security 40 bucks. [audience laughter] There you go, bird. Also, you ever ask married people how it is? [audience laughter] The answers may shock you. By the way, itâ€™s not just men. Ask a woman how marriage is, women sound like a politician ducking a hot-button issue. â€œLisa, how are things with you and Mike?â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œKids are great.â€ [audience laughter] And you ask guys how the marriage is, guys sound like theyâ€™re reading a hostage letter. â€œMike, how are things with you and Lisa?â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œHello.â€ [audience laughter] â€œI am happy.â€
[audience laughter]
â€œDo not worry about me.â€ [audience laughter] â€œWorry about yourselfâ€¦ [audience laughter] â€¦and your heathen lifestyle.â€ [audience laughter] â€œShe has taught me so muchâ€¦ [audience laughter] â€¦and made me a better man.â€ And sheâ€™s in the corner like ISIS like, â€œTell him about the duvet cover.â€
[audience laughing and applauding]
â€œOh yeah.â€ [audience laughter] This is fun. Itâ€™s just fun to be out, right? Do you know what one of the upsides of COVID might be, I hope, is uh, empathy for mental health stuff, right? â€˜Cause everybody was isolated. And human beings donâ€™t do well with isolation. Weâ€™ve still got cave brains. So we think if weâ€™re isolated that the tribe is rejecting us, and then we start picking away at ourselves and finding faults that arenâ€™t there andâ€¦ Basically, our mental health declines. So I hope in the future that people have empathy when someone says, â€œIâ€™m depressed or anxious,â€ theyâ€™ll go, â€œYeah, I remember that.â€ Because for a lot of us, weâ€™ve felt isolated our whole lives. And the other thing Iâ€™ll say, one of the things I didnâ€™t mind about COVID was that we could all just chill a bit with work. We could put the sword down a little bit. If you achieved something during COVID, cool. If not, also cool. The only people who accomplished anything during COVID to me were Bo Burnhamâ€¦
[audience laughter]
Amazon.com, and the 1998 Chicago Bulls. Somehow.
[applause]
They, like, won again, right? But it was nice to chill out, but as soon as the world opened up, I was back comparing myself to other comedians, and seeing who was doing whose podcast, and who did what venue, and how many tickets they sold. And am I too old to be on TikTok? Can a person do lip-sync videos and be on cholesterol medication? [audience laughter] Yeah, like I said, comedy is so public, and it can be sort ofâ€¦ you know, itâ€™s exposing. And, like I said, thereâ€™s a lot of ways in which I feel like I donâ€™t fit into the world, and Iâ€™m not doing it especially good, but comedyâ€™s one of these things where I feel like I know what Iâ€™m doing, Iâ€™m part of something, but thereâ€™s always a reminder like, â€œYou donâ€™t.â€ Right before the start of COVID, Netflix had a party. By the way, this storyâ€™s so name-droppy, I apologize in advance. This storyâ€™s so name-droppy, DiCaprio was there, I donâ€™t even mention it. [audience laughter] So, uhâ€¦ Netflix has a party, and itâ€™s at the head of Netflixâ€™s house. A guy named Ted Sarandos. A great man. [audience laughter] [woman cheers] A great man.
[audience laughter]
So itâ€™s at Ted Sarandosâ€™ house, and I walk in, and itâ€™s the biggest comedians in the world, right? I look over, itâ€™s Burr, Aziz, Mulaney, Ali Wong, Sarah Silverman, Wanda Sykes, Trevor Noah, Borat.
[audience laughter]
And youâ€™re like, â€œPretty good. Pretty big, Neal. All right.â€ Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Kevin Hart. And then I look over here, Ellen DeGeneres, Eddie Murphy. I was like, â€œGod damn. Iâ€™ve never seen all these people together, ever.â€ Right? And I remember thinking, â€œBuddy, I donâ€™t know what you did to get invited to this party, but it mustâ€™ve been pretty good, and Iâ€™m proud of you.â€ And Iâ€™m just looking around at all theseÂ heroes of mine, right? Uh, all icons. And Ted Sarandos, who is a great manâ€¦ [audience laughter] â€¦gives a toast, and he goes, â€œItâ€™s such a thrill for me to be in the same room with all of my comedy heroes.â€ And Chris Rock yells out, â€œAnd Neal Brennan!â€
[audience laughter]
I just thought, â€œMan, I hope someday Chris gets humiliated in front of all of his peers.â€
[audience laughing and applauding]
And a great joke, by the way. Like, the right joke to make. I wish I couldâ€™ve been somebody else so I could have enjoyed it more. I was like, â€œOh fuck, I am Neal Brennan. Shit.â€
[audience laughter]
You know in a movie when someone gets embarrassed and they cut to slo-mo shots ofâ€¦ â€œHa, ha, ha.â€ My slo-mo shots were Ellen goingâ€¦ [distorted] â€œHa, ha, ha.â€ And Borat was like, â€œMy wife!â€ [audience laughter] But, yeah, it just made me, like, second-guess myself, as usual. â€˜Cause all these people are such naturals. Dave started doing comedy at 14. He was good then. Eddie knew he was going to be on TV when he was five. Ellen called being onÂ The Tonight Show before she did stand-up. Like, just all these stories, right? And meanwhile, I did it completely backwards. I was a writer, then I became a comedian in my thirties, and I had toâ€¦ Iâ€™m not a natural. I had to grind and take vocal lessons and movement classes. I listened to multiple audiobooks about charisma. Multiple. [audience laughter] I act like this is all past tense. Iâ€™m doing it now. See this thing? â€œItâ€™s not a watch.â€ Youâ€™re right. Itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s called a Pavlok. This thing gives me a small electric shock every three minutes on stage to remind me to smile more. Itâ€™s been happening the entire show.
[audience laughter]
[audience applauds]
Yeah, when Iâ€™m around people like that, Iâ€™m like, â€œAm I not supposed to be doing this?â€ By the way, what even is this? Why canâ€™t I just do regular stand-up? Last time I was like, â€œIâ€™m going to need three different microphones set up equidistant.â€ This one isâ€¦ And this oneâ€¦ â€œUghâ€¦â€ â€œHa, ha, ha, ha.â€
[audience laughter]
And then this show Iâ€™m like, â€œHey, everybody, I brought blocks!â€ [audience laughter] Iâ€™ve spent the lastâ€¦ 15 years of my life being a comedian. And every comedian I met was like, â€œYou seem like more of a writer.â€ Which is comediansâ€™ way of saying, â€œGive me your jokes.â€ Before that I was a writer, and every writer was like, â€œYou seem like more of a comedian.â€ Which is writersâ€™ way of saying, â€œYouâ€™re annoying.â€
[audience laughter]
If just feels like comedians over here, writers over here. Neal, you can just stay in this middle area, with your little stand-up traumedy shows. [audience laughter] Did I mention I paid her for this? Individuallyâ€¦ these things are all manageable, you know? But itâ€™sâ€¦ In totality, thatâ€™s the hard part. Thatâ€™s where the depression comes. And Iâ€™ve tried so much stuff. Like, so much. Therapy, medication. Ketamine. I tried transcranial magnetic stimulation. [click] Ooh, okayâ€¦ [loud clicking] That was good, but it kind of wore off. So then I went to China to get a stronger version of TMS which isnâ€™t legal in the States. [loud clicking] It may not even be legal in China, for all I know. And then, I did 5-MeO-DMT. Like Bufo alvarius. Itâ€™s like the nuclear bomb of psychedelics. I think I went too farâ€¦ with that one. Like, I thinkâ€¦ I think I hurt myself a little bit. Yeah, but I guess it makes sense if youâ€™re looking for a magic bullet, occasionally youâ€™re going to get shot. But I just kept thinking, â€œDude, how did you turn self-help into self-harm?â€ Iâ€™ve been saying all night that somethingâ€™s wrong with me. And something is wrong with me.
[gentle music playing]
I wonâ€™t show myself any kindness. I wonâ€™t give myself any grace. Like, I just grind and attack myself relentlessly like itâ€™s my job. I would love to stop. I like to believe that my ways of being, like my thoughts, my habits, my emotions, my beliefsâ€¦ Iâ€™d like to believe that theyâ€™re not defects. Iâ€™d like to believe that alchemy of a personalityâ€¦ my spiritâ€¦ itâ€™s got to be enough. Please. Let that be enough.

How you doing, everybody? Welcome to the show!
[cheering continues]
Welcome to the show! Welcome to the show! Thank you so much for coming out! We made it! Oh, we made it. This is so amazing. What a long time. It has been too long. Too long. But weâ€™re back.
[applause]
And itâ€™s so good to see you all again.
[crowd cheering]
Oh, man, Iâ€™ve missed this. Iâ€™ve missed this so much. Iâ€™ve missed going around the world. Iâ€™ve missed peopleâ€™s languages and cultures. We just did Europe as well. It was so fantastic. One of my dreams came true. I got to go to Switzerland for the first time. One of my dreams. If you donâ€™t know this about me, Iâ€™ll tell you why it was such a big dream. My mother is a Black woman, Xhosa woman, from South Africa. I grew up in South Africa, right? Molweni, molweni.
[crowd cheering]
My dad is a Swiss man from Switzerland. White man, right? And so, I never got to go to Switzerland. Then, when I got the chance, I never made the time. Then I couldnâ€™t go. Then finally now, we went to Switzerland for the first time. And it was liberating. â€˜Cause hereâ€™s the thing. My whole life, my whole life, I have always felt like my dad didnâ€™t really love me. Okay? And then now, when I went and met him in Switzerland, I was like, â€œNo.â€ â€œHeâ€™s just Swiss.â€
[laughter]
Theyâ€™re all like that.
[scattered cheers]
It was a bit weird, though. I tried to surprise him, though. Right? I tried to surprise him by learning German. We hadnâ€™t seen each other for a while. Because he speaks German, I thought Iâ€™d surprise him on the trip. You know? I went on Duolingo, did a bunch of studying. And I got to Germany. Like, practiced the whole thing. Got to Switzerland, was like, â€œOh, this is it.â€ I was ready. Like, â€œIâ€™m gonna surprise my dad.â€ I planned to get to his house, knock on the door. Heâ€™d open it, surprised, like, â€œOh! Trevor!â€ Then Iâ€™d be like, â€œPapa, ich sprechen Deutsch!â€ He was gonna be like, â€œHuh? Ich liebe dich!â€ Be likeâ€¦
[celebratory singing]
Was gonna be a whole thing. I had it all planned out. Didnâ€™t go according to plan.
[laughter] I got there. He was surprised. He was happy. But as soon as I spoke, I was like, â€œPapa, ich sprechen Deutsch!â€ He was like, â€œDonâ€™t do that. Donâ€™t do that, huh?â€ [laughter] â€œNo, donâ€™t do that. No.â€ Learning German has been a weird journey for me. You know? I wanna speak it because most of my family speaks it on my dadâ€™s side. But Iâ€¦ Iâ€™ve learned a few things about my German which havenâ€™t been great. I was in Germany, visiting some extended family in a place called Cologne. Beautiful city. If youâ€™ve never been, you should go. Stunning. Stunning place. And one of my friends, Rolf, was with me in the city. Right? One day Rolf turns to me, likeâ€¦
[German accent] â€œTrevor, you know, today maybe we should have a traditional German meal, ja?â€ â€œYou want to eat something traditionally German?â€ â€œJa, weâ€™re going to take you, okay?â€ I was like, â€œThat sounds amazing, Rolf. What are we gonna have?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œAh, okay, have you heard of Subway?â€
[laughter]
â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s German, Rolf.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNein, nein. Iâ€™m just saying to understand the chain.â€ â€œRight? Where youâ€™re going to be having the sandwiches und you are having the bread und choosing the toppings.â€ Like, â€œYeah, I know how Subway works, man.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOkay. Ach so, I want to take you to a German version, ja?â€ â€œBetter than that. Better.â€ â€œLike, with the best bread und meat. You have to go.â€ So he took me, and he wasnâ€™t lying. So we go to this sandwich shop. Itâ€™s, like, 50 years old. Everything is in German. We walk in, I was like, â€œOh, this is it!â€ â€œMight not be my dadâ€™s house, but this is where I can practice my German.â€
[laughter]
Rolf looks at me, like, â€œWould you like me to order?â€ I was like, â€œNo, Rolf, Iâ€™llâ€¦ Iâ€™ll order the food.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOkay, youâ€™re going to buy the food?â€ Like, â€œNo, youâ€™re gonna buy. I just wanna order it.â€ [laughter] â€œI just wanna practice my German.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œBut they might not understand you, ja?â€ â€œBecause German can be diffâ€ I was like, â€œYo, I got this, Rolf. I got this.â€ So I walk up to the counter. The woman was really friendly. Like, â€œGuten Tag, kann ich dich helfen?â€ I was like, â€œGuten tag!â€ [laughter] [shouting] â€œIch will ein kleinen Broten haben, bitte schÃ¶n!â€ â€œDas schwarze Broten mit dem KÃ¤se!â€ â€œUnd das Schinken, bitte schÃ¶n!â€ â€œUnd gib fÃ¼r mich ein Pepsi Cola! Danke!â€ [laughter] And she shat herself.
[laughter continues]
Iâ€™ll never forget the look in that womanâ€™s face. She was petrified. She stared at me and was likeâ€¦ [gasps] â€œDer Schwarze Hitler!â€ [laughter] Which means â€œthe Black Hitler.â€ [laughter] Yeah. The way I inflect on certain words has a certain, uh, FÃ¼hrer feeling to it, apparently. [laughter] I was devastated. Rolf thought it was hilarious. The whole ride home, weâ€™re in the car, heâ€™s hitting himself. [mimics laughter] â€œOh mein Gott!â€ â€œDer Schwarze Hitler!â€ [cackling] â€œOh, Trevor, can you imagine if Hitler was Black?â€ [continues cackling] â€œIt totally wouldnâ€™t have worked, ja?â€
[audience laughing]
Like, â€œRolf, itâ€™s not that funny.â€ â€œI tried to learn German to connect with my family and sound like one of the worst humans in history.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, but it was totally funny.â€ â€œYou should have seen yourself.â€ [mock shouting] â€œItâ€™s like you were about to invade the meat section.â€ â€œOh mein Gott!â€ â€œOh, you should haveâ€ I was like, â€œRolf, itâ€™s not cool, man!â€ â€œIâ€™m in pain right now.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œCalm down, Trevor. Calm down, ja?â€ â€œIndulge me mein schadenfreude, okay?â€
[laughter]
He actually taught me a new word that day. Yeah. Never heard it before. â€œSchadenfreude.â€ German word. Schadenfreude. All right? It means â€œto take great joy in the pain and suffering of others.â€ [laughter] [chuckles] Fun factâ€¦ That word was never translated into another language.
[laughter]
I wonder why.
[laughter continues]
Pretty insane word, right? Schadenfreude. Why would you want that? To indulge in othersâ€™ pain and suffering. Why would youâ€¦ But then when I thought about it, I was like, â€œIt sounds terrible, butâ€¦ we all do it.â€
[laughter]
Every one of us in this room. We all experience schadenfreude. You know? We all do. You know when you have schadenfreude? When youâ€™re driving on the highway, yeah? And youâ€™re cruising along, everythingâ€™s going well, and you look over on the other side, and the traffic is packed up. [laughter] And you get that little feeling inside. Likeâ€¦ [giggles] â€œI made the right choices in life!â€ [maniacal chortle]
[laughter, applause]
Thatâ€™s schadenfreude. You know what schadenfreude is? Schadenfreude is what happened when Black women saw middleaged white men crying after Disney said they were changing The Little Mermaid.
[laughter, cheering]
Thatâ€™s schadenfreude. That was one of the funniest things Iâ€™ve ever seen in my life. Grown men, crying.
[whiny masculine voice] â€œThis is ruining my childhood!â€ â€œThey changed The Little Mermaid!â€ â€œShe looks nothing like the original!â€
[normal voice] â€œNothingâ€? She looks nothing like the original, really? Nothing? There is nothing that reminds you of the original when you look at her? Nothing at all? You realize the only thing that changed is the color of her skin? This part of the color of her skin. The hairâ€™s red, the body is fish. That doesnâ€™t remind you of The Little Mermaid? That was the main thing that you recognized in The Little Mermaid? Really?
[laughter]
You know what schadenfreude is? Schadenfreude is what everybody from Ireland and Kenya and Trinidad and Jamaicaâ€¦ [scattered cheering] â€¦and South Africaâ€¦ and Indiaâ€¦
[cheers continue]
â€¦all felt when the news came out and said, â€œThe Royal Family has bad news.â€
[audience laughing]
[Trevor chuckles] Hereâ€™s the thing people donâ€™t understand. People are likeâ€¦
[British accent] â€œAre you laughing at this?â€ â€œAre you laughing at this?â€
[normal voice] â€œYes, first of all. Butâ€¦â€
[laughter]
â€œâ€¦youâ€™re misunderstanding it.â€ Right? The Royal Family always gets sensitive about people responding to their bad news. But they donâ€™t understand, thatâ€™s not really bad news. Every time the Royal Family wants us to feel sorry for them, is it really bad news? Huh? They be likeâ€¦
[British accent] â€œPlease, we ask you for your sympathy right now.â€ â€œWe have lost Harry and Meghan.â€
[normal voice] â€œLost them? Theyâ€™re missing?â€
[British accent] â€œNo, no.â€ â€œYour favorite British couple has now become your favorite American couple.â€
[dramatic sobbing]
[audience laughing]
[Trevor giggling]
[British accent] â€œThe Royal Family has bad news.â€
[normal] â€œIs it bad news?â€
[British] â€œYes, it is.â€ â€œThe Queen has died.â€
[normal] â€œDied of what?â€ Finishing life!
[laughter]
You kidding? Iâ€™m not saying someone shouldnâ€™t grieve, but she finished life. Do you know how many human beings donâ€™t get to do that? She finished it. She died as Queen. Died of what? Old age. That means you finished the game. Done. Credits are rolling.
[cheers and applause]
Buried with the jewels. Hashtag â€œwinning.â€ You want the colonies to be sad? Those are their jewels. [laughter] Africans are like, â€œCan we have our diamonds back?â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œNo, the Queen takes them with her.â€ [laughter] You kidding me? People are like, â€œThis is not the time to be talking about her.â€ â€œYou shouldnâ€™t be saying bad things about her. Itâ€™s notâ€¦â€ â€œYou shouldnâ€™t be speaking ill of the dead.â€ No, thatâ€™s exactly what you should do.
[crowd chuckling]
Yeah, the perfect time to talk shit about people is when theyâ€™re dead. All right? [laughter] Can we agree on this in society? Maybe be nicer to each other when weâ€™re alive, and letâ€™s talk shit when people die. All right?
[cheers and applause]
Do that for me, people. When Iâ€™m dead, say whatever you want about me. When you see me in the streets, just say hi. [laughter] You know why? â€˜Cause Iâ€™m gone. People are likeâ€¦ [angry muttering] â€œThese people up there dancing on her grave.â€ Yeah, thatâ€™s what graves are for. Thatâ€™s why they made them flat.
[laughter]
The whole point was people could dance on them. Otherwise, they wouldâ€™ve made them slanted so you would slide off. And even in that, the Queen is winning. Sheâ€™s got some of the best dancers dancing on her grave. Huh? Can you imagine the Africans coming in? Theyâ€™re just there, huh, doing their thing? Then the Irish are like, â€œWeâ€™re up next. Hey!â€ â€œOh, save us some space on the grave.â€ Youâ€™ve got the Indians coming in. â€œNow itâ€™s our moment.â€ Finally, everyone from the Caribbeanâ€¦ â™ª Murder, she wrote â™ª
[laughter, applause]
Give it up!
[audience laughs, applauding]
One of my favorite things I used to love doing was watching horror movies and then judging people when they made stupid decisions. [laughter] I love it. I watch horror movies. I wait for people to make stupid decisions. And then when they die, Iâ€™m like, â€œYou deserved it.â€
[laughter]
Never makes sense. Never. You know? Someone being chased. Thereâ€™s, like, a guy in a mask, and heâ€™s got a knife. Right? Guyâ€™s walking. Person runs to their car. They always fumble with the keys. [panicked whimpering] Dead. What are you doing? [laughter] What are you doing? If someoneâ€™s chasing you with a knife and you get to a car, donâ€™t bother getting in. Itâ€™s a waste of time. All you do is just run to this side of the car. And then you wait. [laughter] When they go that way, you go this way.
[laughter]
They go that way, you go this way. Yeah, we can do this shit all day. [vocalizes jaunty tune] People make the dumbest decisions in horror movies. I donâ€™t get it. My favorite is when people just have to hide. Thatâ€™s all they have to do. Just hide and shut up. [laughter] For an hour and a half, they canâ€™t do it. Like in A Quiet Place. Have you watched that? One of my favorite movies of all time. Yeah? The one with the aliens that donâ€™t see anything? They just use echolocation to figure out where everyone is. [throaty clicking vocalizations] [laughter] [continues clicking sounds] Thereâ€™s always the people hiding in the shed. Just there, likeâ€¦ [loud, trembling breaths] [laughter] [quavering] Shhâ€¦ [shuddering sobs]
[audience laughing]
You just have to be quiet. You can just chill. Just be there, chilling. [chuckles] Could be sitting there playing Xbox quietly. [laughter] Noâ€¦ [whimpers] Shhâ€¦ Thereâ€™s always that baby. [mimics baby giggle] [shuddering] Shh! And thereâ€™ll always be the moment where you can see the monsterâ€™s given up. You know? The moment where the monsterâ€™s likeâ€¦ [clicking] [rapid clicking] [laughter] And just as itâ€™s about to leave, just as itâ€™s about to go, thereâ€™s always one idiot, one idiot who jumps up, like, â€œI canâ€™t take it anymore!â€ â€œCome get me!â€ [mimics impact grunt] Dead. You deserved it.
[audience laughing]
â€˜Cause I never got it. Right? I never understood. Why? All you have to do is wait. You just stay inside for long enough, and the danger will subside. Why canâ€™t you do it? Why is it so hard to just stay inside? And then the pandemic hit.
[audience laughing]
I was like, â€œAh, now I get it.â€
[laughter continues]
Ah, â€™cause we all hit our breaking point. The pandemic made people crazy. I thought we were all gonna come together. Thatâ€™s what I believed. From all the movies I watched as a kid. I thought if humans were ever threatened with an existential threat, we would abandon every single fight we were having, and we would come together to win. You know? I thought if that virus came, weâ€™d all be there. Weâ€™d be like, â€œAll right, no more racism. No more sexism. Letâ€™s do this together.â€ And weâ€™d go and defeat the enemy aliens, and then weâ€™d come back, be like, â€œAll right, letâ€™s get back to the racism and sexism.â€
[laughter]
Like in Independence Day, thatâ€™s what happened. Remember? Yeah. Thatâ€™s what I grew up watching. Everyone in the world came together to fight the aliens. We stopped all ourâ€¦ There was no politics, no nothing. We unified, and we won. And then in real life, what do we do? We fought each other, and we lost. We were supposed to be a team. Will Smith was supposed to be our hero. [laughter] None of it went as planned!
[applause]
[Trevor chortles]
[audience chuckling]
I wonder if thatâ€™s how the dinosaurs went out, you know? Maybe they just couldnâ€™t agree on anything. Maybe some warned the others, like, â€œThereâ€™s an asteroid!â€ â€œThereâ€™s an asteroid coming down to Earth!â€ Other dinosaurs are like, â€œAsteroids are not real!â€ [laughter] â€œItâ€™s a hoax!â€ That rock smashed into the planetâ€¦
[mimics impact explosion]
Dust covered the globe. All the dinosaurs were running around in panic, â€œAhh! The dust is everywhere!â€ â€œWear a mask! Wear a mask!â€ [laughter] The T. rex was like, â€œI canâ€™t!â€
[laughter continues]
[giggling] You know whatâ€™s so crazy isâ€¦ I thought the pandemic was gonna ravage Africa the worst. Yeah, I wonâ€™t lie. I was terrified. I was terrified for the African continent. My whole life, Iâ€™d seen, whenever there was a virus that broke out in the world, if it got to Africa, we got it the worst. I remember when it started spreading around the globe. I was getting ready for it. My friends from home were calling me on the phone. Theyâ€™re like, â€œTrevor, are you seeing whatâ€™s happening with coronavirus?â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™m seeing it.â€ â€œWhat do you thinkâ€™s gonna happen?â€ Like, â€œAww, man. You guys are screwed, man.â€
[laughter]
â€œYou guys?â€ Like, â€œYeah. Iâ€™m in America, baby.â€ â€œI made the right choices in life.â€ [laughter] Turns out it was the other way around. Pound for pound, Africa did better than any other continent in handling the disease.
[cheers and applause]
Shocked everyone. What was even wilder was thisâ€¦ When Ebola was happening in Africa, the news always made it seem like it was Africansâ€™ fault for having Ebola. Every time youâ€™d watch the news, there was always a subtle level of blame that was happening in the news reports, right? Didnâ€™t humanize the people. It would always be someone random on, like, Sky or the BBC standing there. Thereâ€™d be dead bodies piled up behind them. Like, â€œSarah, Iâ€™m standing in West Africa, where as you can see behind me the bodies of Ebola victims are piling up.â€ â€œMany European scientists are asking if unfortunately these Africans have themselves to blame.â€ â€œTheyâ€™ve been refusing the advice of the World Health Organization, not understanding the importance of distancing from each other during this time.â€ â€œAnd it appears that they only have themselves to blame.â€ â€œDillian Pann, BBC. Back to you in the studio.â€ And I would watch this and be like, â€œNo!â€ â€œAfricans, why do we do this to ourselves?â€ â€œWhy, Africa?â€ â€œWhy?â€ â€œWhy do we love doing this to ourselves?â€ â€œWhy do we like kissing monkeys?â€ Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.
[laughter]
Mwah, mwah, mwah. â€œThe lips are so sexy.â€
[laughter]
And then when COVID came, Africans used everything they had learned from every virus they had to fight without the help of the West, and they dealt with it better than any other continent.
[applause]
Didnâ€™t get credit, by the way. Everyone made it seem like it was luck. Thatâ€™s where the world is lucky that Africans arenâ€™t spiteful. Yeah. Africans arenâ€™t spiteful people. â€˜Cause I wouldâ€™ve given anything to see one African news anchor be like, â€œGood evening, everybody, and welcome to the Africa News Network.â€ â€œTonight, we are covering the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that is ravaging the Western world.â€ â€œMany African scientists are asking if these people do not have themselves to blame.â€ [laughter] â€œMany of them have refused the advice of the World Health Organization, completely ignoring the social distancing methods.â€ â€œSome have even had to be shown how to wash their own hands.â€ [tsking]
[audience laughing]
â€œSavages.â€
[cheers and applause]
â€œIt appears what has been increasing the severity of this problem is the fact that some do not even want to wear masks across their face, saying, quote, â€˜I cannot breathe through this piece of cloth.'â€ [laughter] â€œThis is commonly known by scientists as â€˜bitchass lungs syndrome.'â€ [laughter] â€œBack to you in the studio, Chippewa.â€
[cheers and applause]
Wouldâ€™ve given anything to see that. One of the biggest side effects of COVID that I didnâ€™t expect is how stupid it would make human beings. [laughter] Yeah. If thereâ€™s one thing coronavirus did, it taught me how many of my friends are absolute idiots. Everyone studied at the University of Facebook. [laughter] Everyoneâ€™s a scientist. [chuckles] Everyone had a conspiracy theory. â€œYou know what happened here. The government did this.â€ â€œOh, the government?â€ â€œYeah. The government did this.â€ â€œWhy?â€ â€œTo control us.â€ â€œYou thought this gave them control?â€
[audience snickering]
â€œYou think governments wanted this?â€ Which do you think gives a government more control? A population that goes to work, earns money, buys things they canâ€™t afford, get into debt, have to go back to work, do more of the thing they donâ€™t like to get more money to pay the debt for the thing they didnâ€™t need, for the thing they didnâ€™t need or afford. To get more money to go to the job for the thing they donâ€™t like, for the thing they didnâ€™t need, to get the loan for the money for the thing they didnâ€™t want, to get into more debt to get the thing they donâ€™t want, to go to the job they donâ€™t need for the moneyâ€¦ Which do you think gives them more control? That? Or everyone just sitting at home with free money, thinking about life?
[laughter]
Everyone just sitting at home, like, â€œHow come a weekendâ€™s only two days?â€ [laughter] [Trevor chuckles] Thatâ€™s a governmentâ€™s worst nightmare. Conspiracies were stupid. Hereâ€™s the thing. Iâ€™m not against conspiracy theories. Right? Please understand that. I actually like a good conspiracy theory. In fact, I think everybody should hold one. I think, in your life, you should hold at least one good conspiracy theory. Yeah. Keeps you on your toes.
[crowd chuckling]
Donâ€™t just trust everything everyone tells you. You gotta have one. Like, mine? My personal favorite? I believe that gluten is concentrated white privilege. [laughter] You know Iâ€™m right.
[laughter continues]
But COVID, oh, man, the conspiracies were ridiculous. Especially because I know what really happened. All right? Thatâ€™s what frustrated me. No, I do. I knew exactly what caused COVID. I saw it coming and I didnâ€™t say anything. My bad, by the way. I, uhâ€¦ [laughter] Yeah, it was too much wishing. We wished too much. I saw it coming. You know, when I was young, wishing was something that was special. Didnâ€™t happen that much. You had to have a special set of circumstances in order to make a wish. Youâ€™d find a clover with the right amount of leaves. Yeah? Thereâ€™d be a star, shooting. â€œWhere?â€ â€œThere!â€ [gasps] Too late. [laughter] Or it had to be your birthday. Theyâ€™d bring out the candles. And if you blew them all out, you could make a wish. And if you missed any, you died.
[laughter]
But then people just started wishing for anything, huh? Find an eyelash on their cheekâ€¦ [dramatic gasp] â€œMake a wish!â€ Know how many of these shits are on your face at any given time? [laughter] People started wishing on, like, the time. Right? Be like, â€œ11:11.â€ [laughter] â€œMake a wish!â€ Thatâ€™s every day. [laughter] Twice a day on this side of the world, â€™cause people donâ€™t like big numbers. [laughter] You canâ€™t wish every day. Thatâ€™s not a special occasion. But people did it. People were wishing. Wishing, wishing, wishing. Everywhere. Even rappers got involved. â€œOh, I wish a nigga would.â€ Would what? You canâ€™t just leave it openended.
[laughter]
And thatâ€™s how we got COVID. All our wishes came together. And they all came true at the same time. And thatâ€™s what we got. Yeah, COVID was like an asshole genie that gave us everything we asked for. [laughter] We all wished. How many people were rubbing that lamp at the beginning of 2020? Just wishing away, like, â€œOh, I wish I didnâ€™t have to go into the office every day.â€ â€œOh!â€ [mimics whoosh] [evil chortling]
[audience laughing]
[malevolent voice] â€œYour wish is granted.â€ [laughter] Yeah, you wished not to go into the office. You forgot to wish that the office wouldnâ€™t come into your house.
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
Now you are stuck, every day, on Zoom, canâ€™t blink, gotta make constant eye contact. â€œUhhuh. Uhhuh. Uhhuh.â€ [laughter] â€œYeah. Uhhuh. Uhhuh.â€ Had to find the one corner of your house that made it look like you had your shit together. [laughter] Everybody wished. And, boy, we got what we wished for. How many parents were rubbing that lamp? Wishing away? â€œOh, I wish I could spend more time with my kids. Oh!â€ â€œOh!â€ [mimics whoosh] [evil chortling]
[audience laughing]
[malevolent voice] â€œYour wish is granted.â€ [laughter] Yeah. A lot of parents realized the only reason you like your kids is because you only know them parttime.
[laughter, applause]
[scattered cheers, whistles]
You meet them in the morning, send them off, tuck them in at night. Itâ€™s a pretty sweet gig. [laughter] But the next thing you know, everyone was trapped indoors, 24/7. Ooh, it was so fun to watch the parents flip. It was so fun. Remember at the beginning, all the parents were there, like, â€œYou will not open the schools!â€ â€œMy children are not going anywhere!â€ â€œI will protect them at all costs.â€ â€œIâ€™m a mama bear and Iâ€™ll protect my cubs, you hear me?â€ â€œYou will not open the schools until the virus is gone!â€ [laughter] Nine months laterâ€¦
[laughter continues]
Those same parents were there, screaming on the stoop. â€œWhen are the goddamn schools opening?â€ [laughter] â€œYou canâ€™t expect me to spend all day with these kids! Who am I, their mom?!â€ [laughter] â€œThey should be in school!â€ Kids are like, â€œBut, Mommy, thereâ€™s a new variant out there.â€ â€œListen, Timmy, at some point youâ€™re gonna have to see what youâ€™re made of, okay?â€ [laughter] â€œEither your lungs are gonna make it or they ainâ€™t. All right, buddy?â€ â€œNow get on out there and see what youâ€™re made of.â€ â€œIf Simba could do it, so can you. Hakuna matata.â€ â€œGo on, buddy. Go on.â€
[laughter, applause]
[Trevor laughing] We all wished! How many couples out there were wishing? [laughter] Rubbing away at that lamp. Looking into each otherâ€™s eyes. Like, â€œDamn, girl.â€ â€œI wish I could be locked in a room with you all day.â€ [laughter] â€œMmm, mmm, mmm!â€ â€œMmm, girl, I wish they would lock us up and throw away the key.â€ â€œThe things I would do to you.â€ â€œOh, yeah? What would you do to me?â€ â€œGirl, I wish they would tell us we could only see each other all day.â€ â€œAll day.â€ [mimics whoosh, chortles evilly]
[laughter]
[malevolent voice] â€œYour wish is granted.â€ Lot of couples learned a lot during the pandemic. Lot of couples learned a lot during the pandemic. Lot of people realized that love may be unconditional, but â€œlikeâ€ has a timelimit. [laughter] â€œâ€˜Cause I love you, baby. I just donâ€™t know if I like you anymore.â€
[laughter continues]
It all started as so much fun, remember? In the beginning, it was like a sleepover. â€œOh my God, this is so much fun!â€ And then the weeks turned into months. The months turned into years. And at some point, youâ€™d be sitting in the house with a glaze over your eyes, and youâ€™d hear them coughing on the other side. [mimics weak coughing] And youâ€™d be like, â€œYes.â€
[laughter]
â€œOh, yes, Jesus.â€ â€œTake them now, Lord.â€ â€œIf itâ€™s their time, itâ€™s their time.â€ â€œLet thy will be done, Lord Jesus.â€ â€œI could use the extra office space.â€ [laughter] You know, one of the things that saddens me the most about the world we live in is that we oftentimes donâ€™t have the luxury to process the whys. We know that things happen. We feel the things happening to us. But oftentimes, we donâ€™t make the time or donâ€™t have the time to process the why. Why were we so angry? Why did we fight each other so much? We had no compassion for each other. We were the worst of ourselves. And you know, if you ask me, itâ€™s becauseâ€¦ we were scared. As humans, weâ€™ve become so comfortable knowing, that we forget how uncertain life is. We get taught every single day that â€œwe know, we know, we know.â€ We get comfortable knowing, so you think youâ€™ll always know. â€œWhatâ€™s the traffic gonna be like?â€ You know. â€œWhatâ€™s the weather gonna be like?â€ You know. â€œOh, itâ€™ll rain on Thursday.â€ Understand what a magic trick that is? If you had that technology 500 years ago, youâ€™re like, â€œItâ€™ll rain Thursday,â€ people will be likeâ€¦
[mimics tribal chanting]
[audience laughing]
We take that for granted, but itâ€™s also made us forget that life is uncertain. We donâ€™t know. The pandemic showed it. It exposed every one of us. And I think the thing we need to take a moment to think about is the why. Why were we so angry? Why were we so frustrated? It wasnâ€™t because of movies, it wasnâ€™t because we couldnâ€™t go out to parties, it wasnâ€™t because we couldnâ€™t go to the mall, any of that shit. Itâ€™s because we lost each other. I lost you. You lost me.
[cheers and applause]
We lost this. You know? Thatâ€™s the real thing people were frustrated about. And what made it worse was governments made it seem like they knew. I think thatâ€™s the thing that made it worse. They were so confident, they made it seem like they knew. They said it would be 21 days.
[laughter]
Twentyone days. I will never forget that number. â€˜Cause we didnâ€™t ask why. Right? We heard of China building a 10,000person hospital overnight. None of us asked, â€œWhy?â€ [laughter] We were just like, â€œAh, China.â€ â€œThey love building shit.â€ [laughter continues] I remember how confident world leaders were as well. Some more cocky than others. One of my favorites was Prime Minister of the UK, Boris Johnson. Yeah. He was an interesting one.
[laughter]
He went to a hospital during the pandemic, and he was hugging people. Like, right at the beginning, he was hugging people. Journalists asked him, â€œPrime Minister Johnson, do you think itâ€™s appropriate to be hugging people duringâ€¦â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œFirst of all, everyone needs to calm down. This is not a pandemic.â€ â€œLook at my hair. Do I look stressed? Everybody needs to calm down.â€ â€œNothingâ€¦ Everything is fine. I can touch people.â€ â€œWeâ€™re not shutting down. Everything stays open.â€ â€œThe pubs will stay open, the football stays open.â€ â€œExcuse me, I have to goâ€¦â€ [dramatic vocalizations] He was just gone. He didnâ€™t give a shit. You know? Americaâ€™s president, oh, he was even cockier. Yeah. You see him when he came out? Donald J. Trump? Oh, he had all the swag. He was like, â€œFolks, weâ€™re gonna have it handled.â€ â€œIn 21 days, 21 days.â€
[laughter]
â€œThe virus will be gone, 21 days.â€ â€œSome are even saying 20.â€
[laughter, applause]
That disease came and kicked Trump and Boris deep in the chest. Both men went to the ICU, almost died. Only reason they survived is because theyâ€™re both heads of state. They gave them that secret juice. Boris, to his credit, he came out of that hospital like he had seen Jesus.
[laughter]
He came from the hospital, held a press conference, shut everything down. He came there, barely dressed, like, â€œEverybody, this is not a joke.â€ â€œIâ€™ve seen it for myself. The UKâ€™s shutting down.â€ â€œPlease, footballâ€™s gone. The pubs are gone.â€ â€œDo not take this lightly. Iâ€™ve experienced it myself.â€ â€œI promise, this is not fun. I canâ€™t talk, I have to go.â€ â€œPlease, I canâ€™t talk. I have toâ€¦â€ And he was just gone. Gone! That man was terrified. I was halfexpecting coronavirus to come around the corner. Likeâ€¦ [clicking]
[audience laughing, applauding]
[cheering]
Trump, on the other hand, didnâ€™t give a damn. That man will die from being stubborn. He came out of the hospital, could barely breathe, but still held a press conference. Didnâ€™t even speak. Was just likeâ€¦ [dramatic wheezing]
[audience laughing]
[continues wheezing] [laughter continues] [mimics Trump] â€œIf I can do itâ€¦â€ [wheezes] â€œâ€¦so can you.â€
[audience laughing, cheering]
[laughing] Ah, man. [cheers and applause] I honestly donâ€™t get how anybody voted for that man. [laughter] I really donâ€™t get it. [crowd cheering] And by the way, I donâ€™t mean politically. All right? I understand. People will vote for the politics they wanna vote for. I get that. What I donâ€™t understand is why people voted for him. What was even crazier was that some people voted for him and then were disappointed by who he was.
[laughter]
That was the craziest thing Iâ€™ve ever seen. People were like, â€œI canâ€™t believe what heâ€™s doing.â€ â€œI canâ€™t believe what heâ€™s doing.â€ â€œIâ€™m sorry, you canâ€™t believe whatâ€™s happening?â€ â€œDonald Trump. Can you believe this?â€ â€œCan I believe heâ€™s doing the same thing heâ€™s been doing his whole life?â€ â€œYeah, I canâ€™t believe this. This is shockâ€ â€œYouâ€™re shocked?â€ Donald Trump is the least shocking human being Iâ€™ve ever come across in my life. He is consistently being himself. The man is a clichÃ©d villain. Looks like a villain, talks like a villain. He looks like he should be in a ScoobyDoo episode.
[laughter, applause]
With that face, with that vibe? You could see him in the lineup when theyâ€™re trying to solve the crime. â€œWho do you think it is, Scoob?â€ Be like, â€œOh, it wasnâ€™t me, Iâ€™ll tell you that much.â€ â€œI didnâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m innocent.â€ [as Trump] â€œIâ€™m innocent. So innocent.â€ [laughter] â€œSome say, the most innocent man whoâ€™s ever lived.â€ Be like, â€œYeah, I think itâ€™s that guy.â€
[laughter]
I just donâ€™t get it. Why would you voteâ€¦? I mean, actuallyâ€¦ I get it, but I donâ€™t understand. â€˜Cause what I get and Iâ€™ve realized is, in the United States of America, if you want to win an election, all you need to have is a strange voice. [crowd chuckling] Simple as that. Wanna be president of the United States? Get a strange voice, youâ€™re done. Yeah, forget policies, forget ideas. Thatâ€™s boring. You come out there, â€œHere are myâ€ â€œBoo!â€ â€œNormalsoundingass bitch.â€
[laughter]
No. You come out there with a strange voice, the people love it. You realize thereâ€™s been no American president who has a normal speaking voice. None. You can go back as far as you want. None of them spoke normal. None. Go back as far asâ€¦ Like, JFK. JFK. He didnâ€™t speak normal. He had that thing. [mimics trebly voice] â€œAsk not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for yourâ€¦â€ Thatâ€™s not normal.
[laughter]
Donâ€™t care what anybody says. Thatâ€™s not normal. Youâ€™re telling me that man was standing in a McDonaldâ€™s, ordering food with that voice? Like, â€œCould I please get a number one, medium, with fries.â€ â€œAnd Iâ€™ll also have a McFlurry, please.â€ â€œWhat do you mean the ice cream machine is broken?â€ [laughter] Thatâ€™s not normal. No American presidents speak normal. None. Bill Clinton. He didnâ€™t speak normal. He always did that thing where it sounded like he was trying to seduce the audience. You know? Likeâ€¦ [gravelly, seductive voice] â€œI did not have sexual relationsâ€¦â€ [laughter] â€œâ€¦with that woman.â€ [sleazy chuckle] What are you doing?
[laughter]
No American president spoke normal. None of them. George Bush, he didnâ€™t speak normal. Always did that weird chuckly thing. [Southern accent] â€œGonna find the people that did this, and then bomb a totally different country.â€ [snarky chuckle] [laughter] â€œFool me onceâ€¦â€ [snarky chuckle] Thatâ€™s not normal. No American president spoke normal. None. Barack Obama, he didnâ€™t speak normal. Always did that thing where it sounded like his voice was buffering. â€œUhâ€¦â€ [laughter] â€œUhâ€¦ as Americans, uh, we gotta try to get, uhâ€¦ faster internet.â€
[laughter, cheers]
Thatâ€™s not normal. Joe Biden, he doesnâ€™t speak normal. You kidding me? He just fades into mumbles every time he gives a speech. [laughter] Not normal. Heâ€™ll be up there, like, â€œThatâ€™s why the most important thing to understandâ€¦â€ [mumbling] â€œâ€¦the dreams of the finest negroes. Come on, man.â€ [laughter] â€œCome on. Please.â€ â€œI mean it.â€ â€œCome on.â€ Thatâ€™s not normal. Trump, that was the weirdest of all. [laughter] Every other American president was predictable. You understood the ebb and flow. Trump, you never knew what to expect. All right? The volume on his voice, all over the place. Inflection where it didnâ€™t make sense. Do you know how hard it was to figure out where to put the volume on your TV when watching his speech? [laughter] I had to sit there and ride it like a shitty DJ the whole time. As he would speak. Because you wouldnâ€™t know when itâ€™d happen. Heâ€™d be up there, â€œI think, as Americans, we try and try, so try, big trying.â€ [laughter] â€œAll trying.â€ â€œI know this. I do.â€ â€œBut I know and I think if we can, we can, but we wonâ€™t, but we will, but maybe. Butâ€¦â€ [laughter] What?
[cheers and applause]
Itâ€™s not normal. Thatâ€™s why I laugh whenever I come to Canada and watch your news. [laughter] Every time I come to Canada, I turn on the news, and theyâ€™ll be like, â€œThereâ€™s a Canadian scandal happening.â€ â€œJustin Trudeau in another scandal.â€ He has the most adorable scandals. You kidding me? Compared to American presidents? What? Theyâ€™re like, â€œHeâ€™s scandalous.â€ â€œHas he been convicted of anything? Then shut the hell up.â€ [laughter] Be like, â€œHeâ€™s scandalous.â€ Heâ€™s got the terribleâ€¦ â€œHe slept at a rich manâ€™s house.â€ [chortling] Ah, thatâ€™s adorable.
[laughter]
My favorite scandal of Justin Trudeauâ€™s, by far, is the one where he went on a trip to India. [laughter] And then became Indian. [laughter, applause] That has to be one of the greatest scandals of all time. I remember when it broke. He took off. He was wearing a suit. He left Canada. Waving on the plane. â€œGoodbye. Goodbye, everybody. Goodbye.â€ Got on, flew to India, landed. Doors opened, and he came out, and he was already halfIndian.
[laughter]
Had the jacket on. But what was crazy was that as the trip progressed, he became more and more Indian each day. Clearly, no oneâ€™s telling him whatâ€™s happening on the news in Canada, because Canadians were losing it. Like, â€œThis is disrespectful! How can you do this, eh?â€ And he was out there becoming more and more Indian. It started with the top, and then he went down to the pants. He had the full outfit. Then he had the headdress. My favorite was when he walked into a meeting with Indian dignitaries and they were all wearing suits.
[laughter]
[applause]
This man walked into that meeting looking like he was about to audition for Baat Ban. You were like, â€œWhat the hell is this?â€ [laughter] He was getting so Indian that I was hoping a moment would come where heâ€™d be in the middle of a speech, and I was just hoping suddenly heâ€™d be likeâ€¦ â€œCan I just say how proud I am of the work weâ€™ve done together?â€ â€œAs Canadians and as Indiansâ€¦â€
[singing] â™ª â€¦weâ€¦ â™ª
[rhythmic vocalizations]
[laughter, applause]
[vocalizing in Indian musical style] [cheers and applause] I was hoping that would happen. I was waiting for it. â€œThe biggest scandal of all time.â€ â€œHe became Indian.â€ [laughter] I donâ€™t think it was that bad. I just think he tries too hard, to be honest. You know, I think Justin Trudeau tries too hard. Tries too hard to show heâ€™s compassionate. Tries too hard, you know? I donâ€™t think itâ€™s that bad. And look, Iâ€™m biased. I know Iâ€™m biased. I am. Because Iâ€¦ I too have Trudeauâ€™d. [laughter] Iâ€™llâ€¦ Yeah. Iâ€™ll confess it here tonight. I too have Trudeauâ€™d, Canada. [crowd chuckling] I too have tried too hard to connect with a group of people, andâ€¦ it did not go well.
[laughter]
My story happened in Edinburgh, Scotland. [scattered cheers] Beautiful place. If youâ€™ve never been, go. Stunning. Everything. The place is full of history. The people are lovely and warm. The place isnâ€™t, but the people are. [laughter] Everything is old. They love telling you that. Everywhere youâ€™ll go in Edinburgh, people will be like, â€œHow old dâ€™ya think that bridge is?â€ Like, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œThree hundred years old.â€ Like, â€œOh, okay.â€ They be like, â€œThat church, 500 years old.â€ â€œMeet my son, 800 years old.â€
[laughter]
â€œHe looks six.â€ â€œAye. Scottish workmanship.â€ [laughter] But theyâ€™re a wonderful people. It was really great out there. We were there for a comedy festival, okay? Andâ€¦ what I do whenever Iâ€™m traveling is, if I get to be in the same place as my friends, we try and spend as much time together. And what weâ€™ll do is weâ€™ll order food or weâ€™ll go out, and when we do that, we allow one person to designate the meal. Nobody negotiates. Everybody gets to pick a day. And so, whenever my day comes around, consistently I pick Indian food. All right? Yeah, I think itâ€™s the best cuisine in the world. Nothing comes close. [cheering] You donâ€™t agree with me, letâ€™s meet in the parking lot and we can fight. [laughter] I love Indian food. Loved it my whole life. Weâ€™re in Edinburgh. Iâ€™m with friends. â€œWhere are we going?â€ â€œTrevor, what do you say?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIndian food.â€ â€œEvery time!â€ â€œYes, every time, Indian food.â€ â€œItâ€™s always the same.â€ â€œThen why keep asking?â€ â€œIf you know, you know. Stop asking me.â€
[laughter]
And I searched for where we were gonna go. I always try and find the most authentic Indian restaurant I can find. I mean, like, authentic Indian restaurants. You know? What Iâ€™ll do is Iâ€™ll go to a place, and then Iâ€™ll ask around. Iâ€™ll ask people, like, â€œWhere do you go?â€ Then like, where the white people tell me, I donâ€™t go there. [laughter] [Trevor chuckles] So I found this authentic spot. And it wasâ€¦ I was so happy. Now, the reason it had to be so authentic, just so you understand a little bit of meâ€¦ I grew up in South Africa, as you know. Right? Now, what a lot of people may not know is that South Africa has one of the largest Indian populations outside of India. All right? One of the largest Indian populations outside of India. I know Canadaâ€™s number one now.
[laughter]
But when I was growing up, we had the single largest population of Indians outside of India. Yeah. So if India blew upâ€¦ [mimics explosion] We were India. [laughter] It was that close. And so I was lucky enough to grow up surrounded by Indian culture. In fact, one of my best friends growing up was a little Indian boy by the name of Theesan Pillay. And we were thick as thieves. I donâ€™t think you understand. Every day, we hung out together. We spent our recesses together. Weâ€™re hanging out, eating, everything together. Because we had so many things in common. We met at the beginning of the school year, and we had so many things in common. Like, he liked running. I liked running. Soâ€¦ [laughter] Theesan and I would spend every day together. And our ritual was simple. Weâ€™d go to all the classes we did, and then weâ€™d meet at what we called break time. At break time, weâ€™d sit and eat lunch together. Now, our lunches were very different. All right? Because Theesan would get a packed lunch from his mom every single day. I would get money from my mom to buy food from the school tuck shop. Right? Cafeteria. Right? So Iâ€™d go and buy the food every day. â€˜Cause my mom couldnâ€™t cook, right? Well, she tried once, and I was like, â€œDonâ€™t do this ever again.â€
[laughter]
â€œThis is child abuse.â€ â€œJust give me the money.â€ So, I would buy the food every day. Theesan, on the other hand, had food that his mom made every day. And every day, the meal was curry. I know this because every day, weâ€™d sit down together, Theesan would open his little lunchbox, heâ€™d take out his little can of juice, heâ€™d unwrap his sandwich with little triangles cut out. And then heâ€™d pull it out, heâ€™d open the bread, look inside, and then heâ€™d scream at the top of his lungs. Heâ€™d be like, â€œCurry!â€
[laughter]
â€œDamn it, Mommy.â€ [laughter] Every day. Every day, weâ€™d sit down, Iâ€™d have my food, heâ€™d have his. Heâ€™d take the juice out of the box, unwrap the sandwich, look in between, and be like, â€œCurry!â€ â€œDamn it, Mommy.â€ [laughter] Every single day. Without fail. Every day. Mutton curry. Lamb curry. Potato curry. Every curry you can imagine. But it was curry every single day. â€œCurry!â€ It was my favorite part of the day.
[laughter]
Some days, I wouldnâ€™t even open my lunch for fear of missing the moment. I would just sit there next to him, waiting. And heâ€™d open it up and be like, â€œCurry!â€ And Iâ€™d mouth it next to him. â€œDamn it, Mommy.â€ [laughter] Every day for months and months and months and months, this happened. And then finally, finally, at the risk of breaking it all, I turn to Theesan one day, he screams, like, â€œCurry!â€ â€œDamn it, Mommy.â€ And I was like, â€œTheesan.â€ â€œYou know itâ€™s gonna be curry every day.â€
[audience chuckling]
He said, â€œWhat?â€ [laughter] I said, â€œItâ€™s gonna be curry every single day.â€ â€œEvery day, you open the bread, and then, every day, youâ€™re shocked and youâ€™re like, â€˜Curry! Damn it, Mommy.'â€ â€œBut itâ€™s always gonna be curry.â€ And he said, â€œI know, Trevor. I know.â€ â€œIâ€™m not shocked. Iâ€™m just disappointed.â€
[laughter]
â€œRight? Because every single day, right, I come to school, and then every day, Iâ€™m like, â€˜I wanna eat lunch.'â€ â€œAnd every day, I open the box and I know what itâ€™s gonna be because last night, we had the curry.â€ â€œThen what my mom does is she takes last nightâ€™s curry, then she put it in a sandwich for me, and then thatâ€™s the curry Iâ€™m gonna have today.â€ â€œThen I know when I go home tonight, Iâ€™m gonna eat the curry I know is coming the next day.â€ â€œSo every single day, Iâ€™m getting curry.â€ â€œItâ€™s curry and then thereâ€™s gonna be more curry.â€ â€œTrevor, I know Iâ€™m Indian, but itâ€™s too much, man.â€ [laughter] â€œI just want something different, you know?â€ â€œThey say varietyâ€™s the spice of life, not just curry.â€
[laughter continues]
I was like, â€œAh, but, Theesan, is itâ€¦ Like, is it bad?â€ He said, â€œI donâ€™t even know anymore.â€ [laughter] â€œI lost perspectives.â€ â€œHere, you can have it.â€ And he gave me his curry sandwich. I bit it. And, Toronto, there are moments in your lifeâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦thatâ€™ll forever shape who you are. [laughter continues] Moments that will define who you grow on to be. This was one of those moments. I put that sandwich in my mouth, I bit down, and my mouth came alive. My tongue discovered its purpose. I didnâ€™t know potatoes could pop like that. The flavors were bouncing around.
[audience cheering]
My eyes opened wide. It wasâ€¦ I was like, â€œWow!â€ I was like, â€œCurry!â€ [laughter] â€œThank you, Mommy.â€
[laughter, applause]
And I said, â€œTheesan, this is amazing. You eat this every day?â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œEvery damn day.â€ [laughter] And I was like, â€œOkay, letâ€™s swap.â€ â€œIâ€™ll give you my money for tuck shop, and then you give me your curry food, every day.â€ And we did that. We traded. Let me tell you something. You thought we were best friends before, we turned into soulmates. [laughter] Yeah, because we both got everything we dreamed of. All right? I got to have a homecooked meal every single day. And as an Indian person, he got to start a business. Theesan was in heaven. [laughter] It was perfect.
[applause]
And since then, Iâ€™ve loved curry. So, fastforward many decades. Edinburgh, Scotland. Going out with my friends. Weâ€™re choosing a spot. I choose Indian. Authentic Indian. We get to the place, and itâ€™s legit. Like, it is legit. We walk in and thereâ€™s Indian music playing. There are Indian people eating. Indian cooks in the back. Indian waiters. Indian garbs on the wall. Iâ€™m like, â€œThis is it. Iâ€™m home.â€
[laughter]
We walked in, sat down. And as soon as we sat, one of my friends, Steve, launches for the menu. And I was like, â€œSteve, Steve.â€ â€œItâ€™s cool. Iâ€™ll just order for everyone at the table.â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s fine, Trevor. Iâ€™ll order for myself, thank you.â€ I was like, â€œNo, itâ€™s not about that, Steve.â€ â€œI just prefer to order for all of us, yeah?â€ â€œAll right? You good?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œUh, I donâ€™t know why thatâ€™s necessary. Iâ€¦â€ â€œI think Iâ€™ll just order for myself. Is that okay?â€ I was like, â€œItâ€™s not, no. Itâ€™s not okay, Steve.â€
[laughter]
â€œItâ€™s not okay. All right?â€ â€œBecause youâ€™re probably gonna say some shit thatâ€™s gonna embarrass me in front of my Indian people. All right?â€ â€œSo I just need you to back off for a moment.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m sorry. What would I say that could embarrass you in front of Indian people?â€ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know, and I donâ€™t want it to happen.â€ â€œJust let me handle this, okay?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œLet you handle this?â€ â€œTrevor, Iâ€™ll have you know that Iâ€™ve eaten curry for many, many years.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œSteve, not the time. Just letâ€™s not argue, okay? Not the time.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat do you mean? Why would I embarrass you? Why?â€ I was like, â€œYou donâ€™t need to know why. Letâ€™s just not.â€ â€œNo, why? Because Iâ€™m white?â€ I was like, â€œYou brought it up, not me. All right?â€ â€œI wasnâ€™t gonna bring up race, but you did.â€ â€œYou brought it up. Letâ€™s talk about it.â€ Every time I take my white friends to an ethnic restaurant, they always say some shit that embarrasses me. Every single time. Every time. Either they donâ€™t know how to pronounce the food or theyâ€™ll say some random shit. Like, â€œCan I get that one? The papadums?â€ â€œWhat do you call these ones?â€ â€œCan I get this one, but not spicy?â€ â€œKill yourself!â€
[laughter]
â€œCan I get the curry, but not spicy?â€ â€œKill yourself!â€ [laughter] How you gonna ask for curry but not spicy? Thatâ€™s the whole point of curry. You want curry without the spice. What, do you go to a sushi restaurant and ask for the fish slightly boiled? [laughter] â€œDonâ€™t want the spice.â€ â€œYour forefathers went around the world killing people for this spice!â€ â€œNow you donâ€™t want it?â€ [laughter]
[cheers and applause]
â€œShut up and eat the spice, Steve.â€ And heâ€™s like, â€œTrevor, I really donâ€™t understand where this is coming from.â€ â€œAll right? Iâ€™m not gonna embarrass you. I understand curry.â€ I was like, â€œLetâ€™s just leave it at that. Iâ€™ve got you.â€ â€œI understand this way more than you.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m sorry, youâ€™re not more Indian than me.â€ Like, â€œIâ€™m sorry, what?â€ Like, â€œYeah, you are not more Indian than me.â€ I was like, â€œKuch Kuch Hota Hai.â€ [laughter] â€œWhat the hell is that?â€ â€œExactly.â€ â€œDonâ€™t tell me Iâ€™m not more Indian than you.â€ â€œYou shut up. When the waiter comes inâ€¦â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m not gonna shut up.â€ Like, â€œYou shut up!â€ Like, â€œOkay, fine. Order, then.â€ The waiter walks over, this beautiful Indian man, got his beautiful Indian garb, and he steps up. And I know Steve. I can see him questioning my authority out of the corner of my eye. And thatâ€™s when I Trudeauâ€™d. [laughter] I was just a little too hyped. I wanted to show him that these were my people. As the waiter got there, I didnâ€™t let him speak. I just jumped up and was likeâ€¦
[Indian accent] â€œGood evening.â€ [laughter] â€œIâ€™m going to be ordering for the entire table, please.â€
[laughter continues]
â€œCould we please have three garlic roll naans?â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to have, uh, three rumali rotis.â€ â€œGive us one shahi paneer, one palak paneer.â€
[audience cheering]
â€œYou know what? Weâ€™re going to have a rogan josh. Lamb, of course.â€ [laughter] â€œCould we also please have one butter chicken for my Caucasian friends?â€
[laughter, applause]
â€œAnd then weâ€™re going to have three samosas and three mango lassis to wash it all down.â€ â€œThank you very much.â€ [laughter] I crushed it.
[cheers and applause]
I could feel it. Everyone could feel it. They could feel something. [laughter] â€˜Cause the table went dead. [laughter] The waiter just stared at me. At first I thought he was impressed. Then I realized he was confused. [laughter] And this Indian man leans in, looks me dead in the eye, and heâ€™s likeâ€¦
[Scottish accent] â€œSorry, sir, could you repeat what you said?â€
[laughter, applause]
â€œI canna hear what you were saying. You got a bit of an accent.â€ [laughter] And I was like, â€œOh, shit!â€ [laughter] â€œHeâ€™s Scottish!â€ I mean, I know heâ€™s Scotâ€¦ Weâ€™re in Scotland. Scottishâ€¦ But, like, heâ€™s Indian! I didnâ€™t expect that, right? Because the whole place is Indian. Indian restaurant, people were Indian. Indian garbs on the wall. The guy was Indian. His beard was Indian. But his mouth was Shrek. I didnâ€™t expect that. [laughter] And now he didnâ€™t understand me. â€˜Cause I Trudeauâ€™d too much. [laughter] I didnâ€™t need to try so hard. But then I realized I also couldnâ€™t stop. [laughter] â€˜Cause that would be racist. [laughter] So now, Iâ€™ve got this ScottishIndian man looking at me. Everyoneâ€™s quiet, and heâ€™s like, â€œIf you donâ€™t mind, laddie, could you order again, a little slower this time?â€ â€œI didna hear what ya said.â€ [Indian accent] â€œYou want me to place the entire order again?â€ [laughter]
[Scottish accent] â€œAye, if you donâ€™t mind. Iâ€™m ready whenever you are.â€ [Indian accent] â€œI think everybody can order for themselves at the table. Iâ€¦â€ â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s necessary to hold their hands.â€ â€œEverybody can order individually.â€ â€œAnd we can go from there, okay? We can go from there.â€ Steve was like, â€œOh, I wish I could, but Iâ€™m so afraid I might offend someone. Iâ€¦â€ [laughter] â€œI think my friend here should order for us. Please, Trevor, go ahead.â€ â€œGo ahead. Youâ€™re far more cultured than I am.â€ I said, â€œNo, Steve, please. You can try your hand.â€ â€œIâ€™m sure you know what you want.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, but what if I say something embarrassing?â€ â€œThe last thing Iâ€™d want to do is offend another personâ€™s culture, Trevor.â€ â€œYou canâ€™t offend anybody. There are no mistakes here, okay?â€ â€œWe are all friends, okay?â€ â€œIf anybody make a mistake, we forget about it.â€ â€œIn fact, whatever happens today, weâ€™re all gonna forget about it, okay?â€ â€œJust order. Just order.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, I really wish I could, but Trevor, please go on.â€ I said, â€œNo, just order, Steve.â€ â€œNo, please, Trevor.â€ I was like, â€œOrder, bastard!â€ [laughter] â€œJust order!â€ The waiter was like, â€œHey, thereâ€™s no need to fight amongst yourselves.â€ â€œLook, clearly your friendâ€™s a little uncomfortable.â€ â€œRight? Just order for him.â€
[Indian accent] â€œYes, itâ€™s totally uncomfortable.â€ â€œOkay, could we please have, umâ€¦ uh, three rumali rotis, andâ€¦ three garlic naan, uh, one shahi paneer, one palak paneer, and, uh, could we also get a lamb rogan josh?â€ â€œAnd weâ€™re also going to be having, uh, one butter chickenâ€ â€œFor your Caucasian friends?â€ [laughter] â€œFor anybody. For anybody.â€ â€œAnybody can enjoy different types of curry. They donâ€™t all have to be spicy.â€ â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter, as long as you participate.â€ â€œThere is no wrong way.â€ â€œOh, youâ€™re so understanding, Trevor.â€ â€œYes. Yes, I am.â€ [laughter] â€œCould we, um, also please get, uhâ€ [mimics phone buzzing]
[audience laughing]
[continues mimicking buzzing]
[audience chuckling]
[continues mimicking buzzing] [laughter]
[Scottish accent] â€œArenâ€™t you gonna answer that?â€ [continues mimicking buzzing]
[laughter]
[Indian accent] â€œNo, they can call me back later.â€ [continues buzzing]
[Scottish accent] â€œItâ€™s getting awkward. Just answer your phone. Iâ€™ll wait.â€ [buzzing]
[Indian accent] â€œOkay.â€ [buzzing] [laughter] [mimics button click]
[audience laughing]
[Indian accent] â€œHello?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYes, this is Trevor speaking. How can I help you?â€ [laughter] â€œYes, no, one and the same. Can you get to the point?â€ â€œI canâ€™t talk right now. Can youâ€¦â€ â€œCan you tell me what you need? I canâ€™t speak for too long. Can youâ€¦â€ â€œNo, there is nothing wrong with my voice. Can you just getâ€¦â€ [laughter] â€œNo, everythingâ€™s fine. No, I have not been kidnapped. No.â€ â€œI have not been kidnapped. Everything is fine.â€ â€œThis is not a secret message. Just, can you tell me what you need?â€ â€œNo, we can talk later then. Weâ€ â€œNo, yeah, my voice is like this sometimes. Donâ€™t worry about that.â€ â€œJust No, and I think I know my voice.â€ â€œI know my voice also.â€ â€œWell, Iâ€™ve been me my whole life, okay?â€ â€œOkay, fine. Weâ€™ll talk later. Weâ€™ll talk later.â€ â€œOkay, okay, okay. Love you too, Mommy. Byebye.â€
[laughter, applause]
Most awkward meal Iâ€™ve ever had in my life. I barely ate a thing. I just sat there thinking about my life. [laughter] We finally get up to leave. Steve is beaming from ear to ear. [laughter] They walk out ahead of me, and as Iâ€™m leaving the restaurant, the waiter waves us off.
[Scottish accent] â€œGood night, everybody! Have a great night.â€ And we wave at him. Heâ€™s like, â€œExcuse me, before you go, hey.â€ â€œArenâ€™t you Trevor Noah?â€ [laughter] â€œThe comedian, right?â€ I was like, â€œYeah. Yeah, why?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOh, no, becauseâ€¦â€
[Indian accent] â€œI totally got you, Trevor!â€ [laughter] â€œI totally got you, Trevor!â€ [laughter continues] Like, â€œWait, wait, whatâ€¦?â€ â€œWait, youâ€™re Indian?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOf course Iâ€™m Indian!â€ â€œOf course Iâ€™m Indian! Whole place is Indian!â€ â€œI totally got you, huh?â€ I said, â€œI donâ€™t understand.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou donâ€™t understand?â€ â€œYou walked in. I said, â€˜Look, Trevor Noahâ€™s coming.'â€ â€œThen you start talking with accent. I go, â€˜Iâ€™ll also do accent.'â€ â€œThen you were doing accent. Then I do accent.â€ â€œThen you were doing accent. You make joke, I make joke.â€ â€œDo you like joke?â€ I was like, â€œNo, I donâ€™t like your joke!â€ â€œI thought I was about to get canceled! You see this shit?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œIt was amazing. You were sweating so hard! Not from the curry, eh?â€ â€œThat was so funny, Trevor!â€ I was like, â€œIt was not funny. My friends were laughing at me.â€ Like, â€œI know.â€ Like, â€œI was scared, man. Why would you do that?â€ Like, â€œBecause, Trevor, I take great joy in the pain and suffering of others.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œItâ€™s called schadenfreude.â€
Yo, Toronto! You guys have been amazing. Thank you so much for coming out!
[cheers and applause]
I love you all. Good night!
[midtempo rock beat plays]
[cheers continue]
I love you guys so much. Good night, everybody.

<END>

<START>
[cheering and applause]
[lively music playing]
[emcee] Give it up for my good friend and yours, Whitney Cummings!
[cheering continues]
What is up, Newark, New Jersey?
[cheering]
Whoo! Thank you so much for coming out.
This is my fifth stand-up special I am taping with you tonight.
Itâ€™s been a minute.
Uh, my last special, just to catch you up, I had announced that I had just gotten engaged.
[cheering]
Umâ€¦ nope, nope, nope.
My personality handled that.
The problem is, nobodyâ€™s happy for me when I say Iâ€™m not engaged anymore.
I was just used to, when youâ€™re in your twenties and you break up with someone, everyone is so proud of you.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œGood for you, you donâ€™t need him, fuck him!â€
You break up with someone in your late thirties and people are likeâ€¦
â€œAre you sure?â€
You break up with someone in your twenties, everybodyâ€™s worried about your emotional state.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œHow are you feeling?â€
You break up with someone in your late thirties, people are just worried about your physical safety.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œYou live alone again?â€
â€œWhat if you fall?â€
I guess Iâ€™m a late bloomer.
It took this long for me to figure out what I wanted in a relationship, although I finally figured out what I wantedâ€“ a manâ€“ only to realize that what I want is now considered creepy.
Umâ€¦ I know itâ€™s not popular to say, but Iâ€™m into older men. Thatâ€™s my thing, I like an older man.
[applause]
Are there any here tonight or did COVID get â€™em?
[laughter]
Do we have any at all? Did any make it?
How old are you, sir?
Sixty.
Sixty! Aaaaaahâ€¦
I canâ€™tâ€“ I canâ€™t help it.
Why is that so hot to me?
Itâ€™s not even like a choice.
Itâ€™s like every cell in my body is just like, â€œDaddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddyâ€¦â€
And then justâ€¦
[splutters]
But we canâ€™t, we canâ€™t do this, sir.
[inhales sharply]
Dating an older man is now considered creepy.
I think it was â€™cause of all that sexual harassment news.
Now itâ€™s, like, creepy to date older guys.
Youâ€™re not creepy, sir, itâ€™s not you.
Itâ€™s not you specifically.
Itâ€™s just everything your generation made is a little sketchy.
I dated an older guy last year and we went on a road trip.
Every song on his playlist was, like, wild.
It was likeâ€¦ â™ª Hey, little girl â™ª
â™ª Is your daddy home? â™ª
â™ª Did he go away And leave you all alone? â™ª
I was like, â€œOh, God.â€
I used to love that song.
That shit does not hit the same way.
But the good thing about dating older guys is that every now and then, you get to listen to R. Kelly by accident.
â€˜Cause they didnâ€™t hear about it.
Mâ€™kay? Yahoo! News or whatever didnâ€™t cover that story.
Oh, wow, youâ€™re gonna try to be woke with me?
Newark? You sure?
Youâ€™re gonna try to tell me when the R. Kelly â€œIgnition Remixâ€ comes onâ€“ and itâ€™s not your faultâ€“ that that isnâ€™t a gift from God?
Okay, Iâ€™m not an asshole. Iâ€™m not just going to enjoy the song.
Iâ€™m obviously going to educate him, you know.
Iâ€™m gonna be like, â€œBaby, you need to turn this song off.â€
â€œYou need to turnâ€¦â€
â€œYou need to turn this song off immediately.â€
â€œThis man is disgusting.â€
â€œThis manâ€¦â€
â€œThis man was a sexual predator.â€
â€œWhat he did was wrong.â€
â€œHe objectified women.â€
â€œThereâ€™s a documentary I need you to watch immediately.â€
â€œThereâ€™s a Gayle King interview I need you to turn on, and you need to turn this song off in three minutes.â€
Not dating an older man didnâ€™t work out for me.
I did, however, get conned into dating a younger guy.
Iâ€™m dating a man whoâ€™s nine years younger than I am.
[splutters]
People are so down on younger guys, like, â€œHow do you communicate with him?â€
Like, he speaks, he can speak. Heâ€™s not that young.
Umâ€¦
The only time we have communication problems is when we text because he insists on texting with the little videos, the little moving videos that repeat 50 times.
What are they called, giffies?
GIFs! Everyone calls them something different.
All I know is that if I donâ€™t respond for 20 minutes, I get Homer Simpson backing into a bush.
Fifty fuckinâ€™ times in a row.
Iâ€™m like, â€œI havenâ€™t seen this episode, I donâ€™t know what this means.â€
I know what most of the giffies mean, but sometimes itâ€™s just, like, a random person.
Like, usually, itâ€™s like Amy Poehler from Parks and Recreation, or itâ€™s Steve Carell from The Office, but oftentimes itâ€™s just a random fucking stranger out of context.
When we first started dating, he sent me one.
It was like a random toddler in the back seat of a car with buck-ass teeth.
She was just staring at me, she was likeâ€¦
I didnâ€™t know what I was looking at.
I was with a girlfriend, like, â€œDude, if this is his kid, Iâ€™m fuckinâ€™ out.â€
â€œAbsolutely not, you need to fix that. I canâ€™tâ€“ no, no.â€
â€œâ€˜Course not. I canâ€™t let that bitch ruin my Christmas cards, so make that go away.â€
People are very down on younger guys, I feel like now.
People always say, when I tell them Iâ€™m dating a younger guy, theyâ€™re like, â€œWell, heâ€™s a younger man.â€
â€œIsnâ€™t he desensitized to women from watching all that toxic porn?â€
Like, I donâ€™t think so.
Younger guys are way more sensitive because of whatever porn theyâ€™re watching.
Heâ€™s always so worried about me.
Like he gets really stressed out when I go visit my stepbrother alone.
Like, waits by the door.
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are youâ€¦?â€
Heâ€™s very sweet.
The younger guys are nice. Theyâ€™re nicer.
I think that maybe itâ€™s â€™cause from all that sexual harassment news, I think the younger guys might be scared of us or something, or maybe, you know, they respect us all of the sudden, whatever it is.
Itâ€™s annoying as fuck.
This guy, when we first hooked up, he had to ask permission for everything he did, everything, he had to ask consent.
Heâ€™d be like, â€œCan I kiss you?â€
â€œCan I take off your bra?â€
Iâ€™d be like, â€œI donâ€™t know, bitch, can you?â€
â€œIâ€™m a 39-year-old woman.â€
â€œYou want me to have an orgasm, you better bring me to the brink of death and back.â€
â€œCan you do that?â€
[cheering]
They wonâ€™t even choke us anymore.
Theyâ€™re too afraid to choke us.
Heâ€™ll do a hover, itâ€™s like a choke hover. Heâ€™ll just hover his hands.
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuck am I supposed to do with that?â€
So now I have toâ€¦
So nowâ€¦
So now I have to choke myself.
I have to choke myself on your hand, so now I have to do a sit-up on my day off?
Is this what you bitches marched for, shitty sex?
Is this what you wanted?
â€˜Cause I would like to start a new march.
â€œPay us equally, but choke us like the dirty whores we are.â€
[cheering and applause]
[Whitney chuckling]
Ahh! Heâ€™s very weird about that stuff because three months in, heâ€™s still asking permission.
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are you doing? This is weird. Yes, of course, fine.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œYou just never know these days.â€
â€œAll my guy friends, they all say now that sometimes you can have sex with a girl, youâ€™ll think itâ€™s one thing, and then later, youâ€™ll find out that it was something else.â€
What?
I have a questionâ€“ I know this is gonna get me in so much trouble, but do you guys not know when youâ€™re raping us?
You seem confused.
Two guys have sex with a girl, your guy friends next day are like, â€œHow did it go, man?â€ Youâ€™re likeâ€¦
[inhales sharply]
â€œAhh!â€
â€œDude, it could have gone either way.â€
â€œUmâ€¦â€
â€œWe either had amazing sex or Iâ€™m going to jail, dude.â€
â€œCouldnâ€™t tell ya.â€
[laughs]
And then he goes, â€œIf I donâ€™t explicitly ask, how am I supposed to know if youâ€™re into it?â€
I was like, â€œI see whatâ€™s happening.â€
â€œI need to make an announcement to clear up some confusion.â€
â€œThis will solve that problem.â€
â€œI know itâ€™s a bummer, but during sex, every now and then, you guys are gonna have to look at us in the face.â€
â€œAnd I know itâ€™s a bummer.â€
â€œYouâ€™re just gonna have to check in, just quickâ€¦ quick gander, just see what itâ€¦â€
â€œLook me in the eyes.â€
â€œIf Iâ€™m crying, itâ€™s consensual.â€
â€œWhatâ€™s the confusion?â€
â€œI feel likeâ€¦â€
[laughter and applause]
â€œâ€¦youâ€™re overcomplicating this.â€
No, I do like an aggressive man, but I think that things have gotten a little too aggressive in some fetish communities.
I dated a guy that was in the dom-sub community.
Itâ€™s a very real thing.
And he said to me, like on our third date, â€œJust so you know, I would have to be your dom, you would be my sub.â€
â€œI will text you 30 times a day orders that you have to follow,â€ and I was likeâ€¦ [clicks tongue] â€œLet me stop you right there.â€
â€œYou had me at â€˜texting 30 times a day.â€™ Iâ€™m fucking in, this sounds incredible.â€
Hereâ€™s what I did learn, though.
If youâ€™re going to text a girl 30 times a day a bunch of orders, you better know how to spell.
Soâ€¦ you canâ€™t dominate me if you donâ€™t know the difference between â€œyourâ€ and â€œyouâ€™re.â€
Youâ€™re gonna have to figure that out at some point.
I found it very silly until I realized, like, when he was bossing me around and telling me things to do,
I was like, â€œThis is so goofy,â€ but then I realized you can use that dom-sub thing to change all the things about your dude that annoy you.
Heâ€™d be like, â€œGet down on your hands and knees!â€
And Iâ€™ll be like, â€œMm! Okay.â€
â€œHmm!â€
â€œHmmâ€¦ and while Iâ€™m down here, what if I took off those Birkenstocksâ€¦ mmmâ€¦ and put them in the trash?â€
â€œOoh, I am so submissive.â€
â€œAnd then what if I took this Fast and Furious poster off the wall and put that in the garbage?â€
â€œAnd then Iâ€™m going to take this Call of Duty mouse pad, â€™cause youâ€™re 40.â€
â€œOooh!â€
â€œAnd what if I took those iridescent oak leaves off your head, and what if I sat on them?â€
â€œOoh, so kinky, so kinky.â€
â€œAnd then Iâ€™m gonna tell your roommate to move out!â€
â€œOoh, I am so submissive!â€
[cheering]
You gotta find the silver lining, you never know.
I found it very silly, but every time he would say something that spooked me, I realized Iâ€™m old enough to maybe benefit from this weird-ass lifestyle.
Heâ€™d be like, â€œIf youâ€™re bad, I have to punish you.â€
Iâ€™d be likeâ€¦ [snickering] â€œWhat does that entail?â€
Heâ€™d be like, â€œI have to physically hurt you,â€ and I was like, â€œEww.â€
â€œThat sounds weird.â€
â€œThen again I pay people to do that sometimes.â€
â€œOkay, you know what would really punish me?â€
â€œIf you jammed your finger into this knot right under my shoulder blade for like 45 minutes every day.â€
â€œOoh, that would punish me so much.â€
â€œYou know what I hateâ€“ when people crack my back.â€
â€œOh, please donâ€™t!â€
[sighs] That did not work out. I couldnâ€™t take it seriously.
This new guy, the younger guy, doesnâ€™t make me do anything I donâ€™t wanna do.
Almost likeâ€“ itâ€™s a little much, actually.
I feel like Iâ€™ve gotten really lazy.
Uh, I recently sat him down and I had to retire a couple sexual positions.
Itâ€™s a wrap on Reverse Cowgirl for me personally.
Iâ€™m not trying to be lazy, I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s sexy anymore.
I think itâ€™s just more distracting with my knees going â€œpop-pop-pop, crack-crack, pop-pop-pop-pop, pop-pop-pop.â€
I do believe the joint pop during sex is truly the only thing we cannot laugh about yet as a species.
We can laugh about queefs at this point. Itâ€™s not embarrassing, guys love it.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œYeah, my dick is so big, I made that pussy fart, yeah.â€
[imitating fart]
They love it. They donâ€™t think that you have a giant pussy, they think they have a giant dick, youâ€™re fine.
Youâ€™re fine, youâ€™re fine.
But that joint pop, thatâ€™s embarrassing.
Thereâ€™s nothingâ€¦ thereâ€™s nothing you will not say to get out of that situation, dude.
You go down, like, â€œpop-pop.â€ â€œWas that the bubble wrap?â€
â€œI think that might have been the bubble wrap.â€
â€œPop-pop? Are we under attack, was that a machine gun?â€
I really try, I give it my all. I just have too many injuries.
I go down, 20 seconds in, Iâ€™m jammed up.
I got that catcherâ€™s knee.
He knows right away, heâ€™ll be like, â€œBaby, do you want to turn over?â€
â€œTurn over? Bitch, I live here now.â€
â€œYouâ€™re dating a 39-year-old woman.â€
â€œReverse Cowgirl is not the third or fourth position in a series of nine or ten.â€
â€œItâ€™s the final position every time it is attempted, okay?â€
â€œThe only thing to do at this point is to figure out how I can dismount with a modicum of dignity without further injuring my L4.â€
â€œNow, listen very carefully.â€
â€œIâ€™m gonna need you to scoot out.â€
â€œNeed your little shimmy-shimmy, little reverse Storming Normandy, shimmy outta there.â€
â€œNow Iâ€™m gonna need you to turn the lights out, pitch-black.â€
â€œGo get Mommy some Icy Hot and some WD-40 while I figure out how to get out of this goddamn nightmare.â€
[sighing]
Now I injured my back, which means now I need to retire Missionary.
[laughing]
And I also need to retire this fucking joke.
Whoo!
[applause]
Iâ€™m very pro younger guys, Iâ€™m telling you.
Theyâ€™re very sweet, theyâ€™re very caring, they want us to have orgasms.
This guy always wants to check to see if I have an orgasm.
After we had sex, heâ€™s like, â€œDid you come?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œOf course not.â€
â€œWhen would that have happened? My hands are up here.â€
â€œWhat do youâ€“ what?â€
[applause]
[high-pitched whistling]
Was that a birdcall? What the fuckâ€™s going on over there?
No, heâ€™s very into that, and heâ€™s very into, like, sex toys.
For Valentineâ€™s Day, he got me a sex toy as my main gift.
He showed up with this gorgeous box.
Gives it to me, heâ€™s like, â€œI found this sex toy for you on Instagram.â€
â€œItâ€™s made for women by women.â€
I opened it, itâ€™s gorgeous.
Itâ€™s like this glass orb.
I was like, â€œBaby, this is stunning. We should put this on the coffee table.â€
â€œI wouldâ€“ I would buy this at West Elm. How much did you pay for that?â€
He was like, â€œIt was $180.â€
I was like, â€œOh, youâ€™re going to return that right now and I will masturbate with the cash.â€
â€œSoâ€¦â€
[laughter and applause]
â€œUhâ€¦â€
â€œSomething you donâ€™t know about me is that my kink is thrift, and Iâ€™m never going to be able to have an orgasm knowing that was $180.â€
â€œGet the fuck outta here. Okay? Youâ€™re dating an older woman.â€
â€œWeâ€™re ratchet as fuck when it comes to sex toys, okay?â€
â€œWe came up on the jelly cocks.â€
$18, 92 veins. Thatâ€™s a bargain.
Now, that is a bargain.
They saved money because they molded those jelly cocks onto a homeless man who had just overdosed on methamphetamine and cocaine.
Theyâ€™re likeâ€¦ [straining]
â€œWe got it!â€
â€œNow all we gotta do is cover it in glitter and itâ€™s ready for market.â€
[giggles]
Those jelly cocks had a suction cup on the back.
You just pop that shit onto a wall.
Or a washing machine, in my case.
That is a product made for women.
Is anyone dating an older woman?
Younger man/older woman?
-[man, clapping] Me. -Yes. One guy. Okay.
How much older? How much older is she than you?
Three months.
Three months.
[laughter and applause]
Thatâ€™s your definition of â€œolder woman,â€ got it.
How oldâ€“ may I ask how old you are, sir?
-[man] 53. -53, oh, okay. Okay, got it.
You do get points for that.
Do you have a life insurance policy on her or whatâ€™s, uhâ€¦
[man] Her job does.
Herâ€“ he went, â€œHer job does.â€
Uhâ€¦
I do feel like a lot of guys are now dating older women.
Itâ€™s progressive, but at the same time, you gotta watch it.
Donâ€™t just pat yourself on the back. You canâ€™t waste her time.
You canâ€™t trifle with a woman in her thirties, you know what Iâ€™m saying?
If youâ€™re dating a woman in her thirties, thatâ€™s like going to the grocery store and buying avocados.
You better have a fuckinâ€™ plan.
[laughter]
[applause and cheering]
You donâ€™t just go to the grocery store willy-nilly and decide, â€œIâ€™m gonna buy some avocados.â€
No, you better have fuckinâ€™ guacamole shit in your cart.
You better have a party coming up, â€™cause you know exactly how thatâ€™s gonna end.
Day one, you look at those brand-new avocados, youâ€™re like,
â€œI got all the time in the world.â€
You have five days!
Like my dude, I tell him, â€œI donâ€™t give a shit.â€
â€œYouâ€™re gonna marry me. I will propose to you.â€
â€œI donâ€™t give a fuck, okay?â€
â€œIâ€™m not gonna just let you watch me rot while you plan a scavenger hunt so that I can hunt for my ring, following a treasure map into the woods like a fucking truffle pig.â€
Likeâ€¦ [snorting]
â€œCan I have my ring, please?â€ [snorting]
You guys overthink the proposal thing.
I feel like I want to get ahead of it.
I donâ€™t want him to get down on one knee and propose.
I donâ€™t want him to see my neck from this angle.
Like, I feel like Iâ€™ll lose a lot of leverage.
Donâ€™t you dare shoot my neck from this fuckinâ€™ angle, either.
No, I do not understand why women donâ€™t propose to men more.
Um, I always thought that was weird until I thought through it.
â€œWhy donâ€™t I get down on one knee and propose?â€
And then I realized why â€™cause I thought it through, right?
â€œOkay, Iâ€™m going to get down on one kneeâ€¦â€
Pop-pop, crack-crack.
And I realized that if youâ€™re a woman proposing to a man, you have to open with something completely different than the guys open.
I would have to open with, â€œIf you take your dick out right now, I will fucking kill you.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
[applause building]
â€œI thought that maybe all of our friends and family behind me might be a dead giveaway that Iâ€™m not gonna suck your dickâ€¦ on this beachâ€¦ next to your niece whoâ€™s filming.â€
â€œBut I guess I have to say this.â€
â€œAlso, when have I sucked your dick on one knee?â€
â€œWhen have I ever been in this configuration? Okay?â€
â€œI would never suck your dick on one knee because I know you would think about Colin Kaepernick, and we canâ€™t both be doing that.â€
[audience] Ooh!
[scattered applause]
Then I would just go into my romantic speech.
Iâ€™d be like, â€œAlex, will you make me the happiest woman in the world and let me buy my own engagement ring?â€
â€œâ€˜Cause you canâ€™t afford the one I deserve.â€
[laughter and applause]
[inhales sharply]
[sighs]
Iâ€™ve been wrong before. I can be wrong.
But this is the first guy Iâ€™ve ever dated where I do feel like we might have kids together, but I also kind of want to make sure, before we have kids, we do those, like, 23andMe tests so I know what Iâ€™m in for.
Has anyone done a 23andMe test?
[fan] Whoo!
Yeah? Howâ€™d it go?
[woman] Iâ€™m 10% Native American.
Youâ€™re 10% Native American, but you didnâ€™t know that?
[woman] No idea.
Your kids will be getting into college, so congratulations.
You have that.
Iâ€™m obsessed with these ancestry results.
But no one will let me take that test. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œTheyâ€™re gonna take your data.â€
Who gives a fuck?
Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œTheyâ€™re gonna have your phone number and email address.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay.â€
Iâ€™m old enough to remember when there used to be a book full of everyoneâ€™s phone numbers and home addresses and they would just throw it at your house.
[applause]
They were all over peopleâ€™s porches, in bags.
No one even opened them.
Homeless people would wipe their assholes with your data.
No one wants your fuckinâ€™ data, you dorks!
[laughter]
Everyone in the audience in their twenties is like, â€œShe doesnâ€™t get it.â€
â€œOur data is very precious. Everyoneâ€™s, like, obsessed with it.â€
Iâ€™m aware.
I have a 25-year-old guy working in my office.
Everythingâ€™s about his privacy and his dataâ€“ I canâ€™t even pay him.
He will not send me his tax form.
Heâ€™s like, â€œI canâ€™t email this document.â€
â€œThis is a private document.â€
â€œMy private information.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œCool.â€
We used to fax our â€œprivateâ€ documents to an establishment called Kinkoâ€™s.
To a communal tray.
Full of other private documents.
Our encryption, it was something called a â€œcover page.â€
Just a piece of paper you would put on top of the other piece of paper.
If there was a ceiling fan, you were fucked.
Thereâ€™s no privacy in Kinkoâ€™s.
You go to the front of the line, like, â€œHey, um, Iâ€™m here to pick up my private document.â€
Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œCool. Are you the girl with the DUI or, uhâ€¦ the one with the Valtrex prescription?â€
Youâ€™ll be like, â€œDude, chill, Iâ€™m both. Chill.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
You putting tape over your camera on your computer, sir?
You are? I knew it.
Putting tape over your computer camera.
Youâ€™re like, â€œRussiaâ€™s not gonna see this dick.â€
â€œThey donâ€™t deserve to see this V-neck and this dick.â€
You deleting your cookies?
You donâ€™t know, youâ€™re not sure. That means, â€œYes, every 20 seconds.â€
All the guys in my office are like, â€œWe need a program that deletes all of our cookies.â€
Iâ€™m like, how much weird-ass porn are you watching?
Where is our homie, where is 65? Where is our guy? Did he pass on?
Okay, there he is. Umâ€¦
[laughter]
Listen to me. Theyâ€“ if you can hear me.
Listen, theyâ€¦ watch all the porn on the Internet, and then they complain that it doesnâ€™t get deleted fast enough.
They have to delete their cookies.
Do you have any idea what he had to do when he wanted to see a pair of titties?
He had to drive into town.
Look for a newsstand.
He had to look a grown man in the eye and say, â€œI would like a Big Beaver magazine, please.â€
[applause]
His cookies was a human man!
Who he could run into at the grocery store or church whenever.
He never knew.
If he wanted to delete his cookies, he had to kill his friend!
[laughter and applause]
This man is an American hero.
Thatâ€™s what he is.
I feel I might be a little desensitized to all the privacy stuff.
Maybe, I donâ€™t know, I think that that ship sailed for me.
Uh, if you didnâ€™t hear, a couple of years ago, I had my nudes publicly leaked.
Uh, and Iâ€™m gonna tell you something right now, Newark, New Jersey.
It wasnâ€™t that bad.
[applause]
Wasnâ€™t that bad.
Uhâ€¦
They got my whole cloud, and I was actually way more embarrassed about all my screen grabs of inspirational quotes.
Thatâ€™s the shit you want to get ahead of, that will bite you in the ass.
I was like, â€œYou guys can have my titties, but please donâ€™t tell anyone about all those Marilyn Monroe quotes in that folder titled, â€˜You got this, girl.'â€
â€œIt was a badâ€¦ week.â€
It was so stupid.
It wasnâ€™t even a nude photo that I got to take myself and make it cute.
It was a screen grab of a video that Iâ€™d accidentally uploaded on Instagram Stories when I was in the bathtub and high on edibles.
[scattered laughter]
Soâ€¦
Iâ€™m in the bathtub and Iâ€™m making this Instagram Story, right?
Iâ€™m so high. I get out of the bathtub.
And you know when you post something on social media and youâ€™re like, â€œI feel like that was good.â€
Like, â€œI feel like thatâ€™s gonna get in the algorithm.â€
Like, â€œThatâ€™s gonna get in there.â€
I open my phone to see how many â€œlikesâ€ it got.
â€œ14 missed calls.â€
My friends were like, â€œWhitney, your tits are on the Internet!â€
I had videoed myself gettingâ€¦ out of the bathtub.
And it was a very long video, becauseâ€¦
You know when youâ€™re high or drunk and youâ€™re alone in your house and youâ€™re convinced that all your furnitureâ€™s trying to kill you?
I was like, â€œNot tonight, side table. Not tonight.â€
â€œCoffee table looking at me like Iâ€™m a snack, no way.â€
[laughs]
So I was able to delete it.
Everything was fine, it came down in, like, five minutes.
Three months later, I get this very cryptic email from an AOL address.
This canâ€™t be good.
I open it, and it was a guy who was trying to extort me.
He goes, â€œIf you donâ€™t give me $10,000, Iâ€™m gonna sell this photo of your boobs to a tabloid.â€
And Iâ€™m, like, opening the photo, itâ€™s loading, and Iâ€™m like, â€œWait a second, how did he know my boobs cost exactly $10,000?â€
Like, this is a very fair hacker.
Umâ€¦ I open it and itâ€™s a screen grab of the video where Iâ€™m hunched over at this angle, and it is not a flattering angle.
And on a bit of a serious note, if you guys saw my last special, you know that I talked about my history of struggling with eating disorders and body image issues, and I hope every woman accepts their body unconditionally wherever you are.
[applause]
Except from this angle.
Umâ€¦ because itâ€™s actually not acceptable.
I said all that before I had seen titties from this angle.
Uh, nobody told me, no matter how perky your tits are, the second you bend over, they get long and pointy.
Did you know about this?
Theyâ€™re super perky, then they just turn into traffic cones.
Did you know that?
With, like, a dent in the side.
Like traffic cones where someone kicked in the side of theâ€¦
I did not know about that elasticity situation.
I mean, I had a little bit of a suspicion.
I had seen a glimpse of myself having doggie-style sex in a mirror before, and I remember thinking, â€œWhy do my titties look like those inflatable men outside a car dealership?â€
Theyâ€™re just sort ofâ€¦
And I know on my last special I talked about having fake boobs, but the fake boobs, they do the same thing.
You thought theyâ€™d stay cute, they donâ€™t. They get long and pointy and weird.
I think the fake boobs unionized with the real boobs.
They started working together.
And the only real difference between fake boobs and real boobs is that real boobs, you know, when you lie down, they just completely disappear.
Theyâ€™re gone, dude. They ghost you.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œBitch, I did my job. Peace!â€
Whereas fake boobs, fake boobs, they go no place.
The guy that Iâ€™m with had never slept with a girl with fake boobs before.
The first time I lied down naked in front of him, he literallyâ€“ literally this was his reactionâ€“ heâ€™d be likeâ€¦
[gasps] Like it was aâ€“ audible gasp. It was like [gasps].
I would say, â€œWhat?â€
It is jarring, itâ€™s a little jarring, it is.
Itâ€™s like two crocodile eyes coming out of a pond.
Itâ€™s veryâ€¦
[laughter and applause]
It is relentless.
And, uhâ€¦ although I do sometimes miss having real boobs because I miss them disappearing.
My favorite prank used to be when I would hook up with a guy for the first time, I would lay down and my boobs would disappear, and heâ€™d get on top of me, and Iâ€™d go, â€œHa ha! Youâ€™re gay.â€
[Whitney laughing]
I know. Can you believe Iâ€™m not married?
Umâ€¦
[scattered applause]
Wild!
So Iâ€™m in this situation where this guyâ€™s trying to extort me.
Iâ€™m not gonna give him the $10,000. Heâ€™s just gonna do this to someone else.
So I was like, â€œOh, God, this is such an ethical dilemma.â€
So I was like, â€œOkay, Iâ€™m just gonna post these photos on social media so he canâ€™t sell them.â€
I queued them up to post to Instagram and Twitter in, like, an hour.
I scheduled the post, and then I did like seven shots of whiskey and passed out.
Woke up three hours later.
Your Auntie Whitney trending on Porn Hub.
[cheering and applause]
I feel likeâ€¦ I feel like all the guys that were dragged here by their wives and girlfriends right now are like, â€œThat is how I know her.â€
â€œOkay, I knowâ€¦ â€œ
â€œI got it. I know her, I know her. I know who that is, okay.â€
I get shamed about this all the time.
People blame me, like, â€œWhy were your photos in the cloud?â€
â€œWhy did you have videos in the cloud?â€
â€œWhy didnâ€™t you have privacy for all your photos?â€
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m not a fucking nerd?
Like, when has that even been an option?
Thatâ€™s not something Iâ€™m trained to think is even possible, dude.
We used to take a roll of film, and we would leave it with some guy at Kroger for like a week.
And then we found out whatever the fuck he was doing only took an hour.
Like, none of itâ€™s good.
Those prints came back sticky as hell. You know Iâ€™m right.
I never want to be negative about technology.
The only time I ever get a little bit suspicious of technology is when I go to the doctor and I see some new gadget that we didnâ€™t have before that makes you do math on what we did before the gadget.
Like I had to go in for a COVID test last year.
They were like, â€œMaâ€™am, we need to take your temperature.â€
I was like, â€œCool.â€
They were like, â€œMaâ€™am, we havenâ€™t done that in a while now.â€
I was like, â€œI havenâ€™t had my temperature taken in a while now, so what?â€
This next generation, you just had little laser beams?
Aimed at your forehead?
And we had anal sex with thermometers our entire childhoods?
You guys are just cool with this? Youâ€™re just gonna let this slide?
â€˜Cause I would like to discuss reparations at some point.
If you think about what it was like for us to be at the doctor as kids, itâ€™ll ruin your day.
When I was a kid, you got buck naked at every doctor.
No questions asked.
I still do it.
Old habits, dude. I just want to get out of there quickly, and thereâ€™s rules about it, thereâ€™s laws now.
If a doctor walks in, theyâ€™ll be like, â€œNo, maâ€™am, youâ€™ve got to put on a robe.â€
â€œThis is illegal now.â€
â€œWhat do you mean? Youâ€™re my ophthalmologist.â€
â€œDonâ€™t you need to see ifâ€¦?â€
â€œDonâ€™t you need to see if my nipples work? Like, since when?â€
I feel like what happened is that women started becoming doctors and they looked at the protocols that the male doctors had made before them, and they were like, â€œOkay, letâ€™s see whatâ€¦â€
â€œWait a second, they didnâ€™t need to be naked at the ear, nose and throat doctor, you perverts.â€
They were likeâ€¦ [deep voice] â€œEh, we had a good run.â€
[laughter]
â€œDonâ€™t worry, we got Polaroids.â€
I went to my annual gynecological exam.
For the first time ever, there was, all of the sudden, a chaperone in the room.
Is that a law here?
Thereâ€™s a chaperone during the gynecologicalâ€“ this never happened before. Iâ€™ve been going to this guy for 25 years.
Heâ€™s 70 years old, all of the sudden thereâ€™s this nurse there.
I was like, â€œMy only opportunity to get fingered by an older man, and you are fucking it up!â€
â€œYou are fucking this up for me.â€
[applause]
â€œWhat? What? Oh, heâ€™s got to wear gloves during the exam?â€
â€œCool! You fucking nerd.â€
â€œWe have a thing going on.â€
I was fine, I was like, â€œDude, Iâ€™m used to this.â€
She was the one stressed out. I was like, â€œAre you okay?â€
â€œDo you need a chaperone?â€
â€œYouâ€™re watching me get fingered by Santa Claus.â€
â€œHow are you doing?â€
[laughter]
[applause]
Iâ€™m sorry.
Iâ€™m sorry.
I didnâ€™t mean to ruin Santa Claus for you.
No, I feel like Iâ€™m the most pro-technology of all my friends.
A lot of my friends are very against technology.
Theyâ€™re worried about it.
Itâ€™s mostly my friends that are parents.
As soon as my friends become parents, they get freaked out about technology.
Mostly the phones, thatâ€™s every conversation I have with parents now.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œThese kids, now theyâ€™re on their phones eight hours a day.â€
â€œKids are on their phones all day long now.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œGood.â€
â€œWeâ€™ve finally figured out a way to shut them the fuck up.â€
â€œWhyâ€¦â€
[applause]
â€œWhy are you complaining about this miracle in your living room?â€
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhitney, because the phones are dangerous for the kids.â€
Ehâ€¦
Are they?
Is anything more dangerous for the kids than what we played on?
You want to put your kids on the shit we played on when we were children?
Okay, great, why donâ€™t you put your kid on a merry-go-round?
Remember that quality item?
Itâ€™s like a lazy Susan for pedophiles.
Make sure they saw every angle of the kid.
They wait for the first kid to fall off who didnâ€™t cry.
Theyâ€™d be like, â€œThatâ€™s the one.â€
We used to play on something called a seesaw.
Itâ€™s a piece of wood on a hinge.
The main objective was just to catapult the other childâ€¦ into the air.
And we were such homicidal psychopaths.
If you were the kid that was on the bottom, youâ€™d be like, â€œI wonder what would happen if I just jumped off this?â€
[laughter and applause]
Weâ€™dâ€¦ Weâ€™d watch the other kid careen to the ground, shattered nine vertebrae.
Attempted murder, every day.
At recess.
â€œBut the phones!â€
Fuck outta here.
I have a goddaughter, sheâ€™s five. I went to her playground.
If youâ€™ve been to a playground recently, you know playgrounds are totallyâ€“
You know, playgrounds now, theyâ€™re, like, mushy?
Did you know that playgrounds have shade?
Dude, we had a slide made out of sheet metal.
[cheering and applause]
It would bake in the hot sun.
Dude, youâ€™d get down on it. It was like a hot skillet.
Youâ€™d go down that slide, likeâ€¦ [shrieking]
Weâ€™d be squealing like pigs.
Frying our assholes!
Which had just had a thermometer in it 20 minutes earlier at the school nurse.
[cheering and applause]
It kind of ruined our plans to put sparklers in our butts later that night.
[giggles]
This is a very incendiary thing to talk about, people will argue with me.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhitney, itâ€™s also about, like, the phones.â€
â€œThey can be tracked. What if predators find the kids?â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, thatâ€™s bad, thatâ€™s not good.â€
Then again, when I was a kid on the schoolyard, we would play a game on the swings called â€œSpiderâ€ where you would straddle the other child and justâ€¦ fuck each other.
Weâ€™d just fuck each other in broad daylight.
All the teachers saw what we were doing.
The teachers were in the corner like, â€œAaah!â€
Like, they knew. They didnâ€™t care.
Any predator that found the kid on their phone, theyâ€™d walk up and theyâ€™d be like, â€œEww, never mind, dude.â€
â€œThose kids are nasty.â€
You cannot argue that kids are not physically safer than theyâ€™ve ever been.
Like, kids donâ€™t get injured the way we got injured.
Whenâ€™s the last time you saw a kid in a cast?
It doesnâ€™t fuckinâ€™ happen, dude.
We used to spend the first 45 minutes of school signing casts.
Thatâ€™s how we learned to read and write.
Half the kids in my grade, they had a cast with a metal bar.
It was a metal rod, it was a metalâ€“ kids were doing the Hitler salute just the entire school year.
I do feel like the casts were like the first â€œcomments section.â€
Weâ€™d all write on them, weâ€™d be like, â€œHey, love you. Get well soon.â€
And then some punk would draw like a dick on the back, with balls.
No one would tell the kid.
Just add emotional injury to physical injury.
[giggles]
People will even argue with me about that.
People will be like, â€œNo, Whitney, the kids do get injured â€™cause they type all day and it hurts their fingers and their fingers have pre-arthritis.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œGot it.â€
We used to play a game called â€œBloody Knuckles.â€
[laughter]
[scattered applause]
We would just punch each other in the knuckles until our eyes started twitching.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œBut sometimes the kids have to wear wrist braces because they get tendonitis in their wrists from typing.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œWe used to play a game called â€˜Red Rover, Red Rover,â€™ where you would hold hands with another kid and just pray that your wrist didnâ€™t snap off your fucking body.â€
That is a move thatâ€™s illegal in the NFL, itâ€™s illegal.
Itâ€™s called the flying wedge. We played it every day at recess, dude.
Red Rover, dude.
And then the kid with the metal-bar cast, they let him play!
[laughter and applause]
The kids are fine. Iâ€™ve heard every argument.
Iâ€™ve yet to hear an argument that really convinces me that the kids are in any real trouble, but people will still fight with me.
Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œWhitney, itâ€™s the social media, it traumatizes the children, itâ€™s psychologically traumatizing.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œHmm, when I was five, my parents showed me a movie called Old Yeller.â€
[laughter]
â€œAnd then I had to read a book called Where the Red Fern Grows.â€
â€œFeel like all those alive puppies on TikTok are probably fine.â€
This is a big one, â€œWendy, they could go on the Internet and get misinformation.â€
Thatâ€™s all we got.
My mom used to tell me that when the ice-cream truck played music, that meant it was out of ice cream.
[laughter and applause]
Do you know how fucked up that is?
We got misinformation in the form of lies.
From people that were supposed to love us.
I remember on the way home from school, Iâ€™d be like, â€œMom, can we stop at McDonaldâ€™s?â€
Sheâ€™d be like, â€œSorry, baby, itâ€™s closed.â€
Like, â€œAw, man!â€
Try pulling that shit with a kid today. Good luck.
Be like, â€œMom, I wanna go to McDonaldâ€™s.â€
Sheâ€™ll be like, â€œSorry, baby, itâ€™s closed.â€
â€œBitch, thatâ€™s a 24-hour McDonaldâ€™s.â€
â€œAnd if you donâ€™t take me right now, I will tweet that you molest me.â€
â€œSoâ€¦ your move, baby girl.â€
â€œYour move.â€ [giggles]
Iâ€™ve just heard every argument, and I feel like itâ€™s a little overblown.
What I hear is about how kids, all they do is take pictures of themselves.
â€œThey just take pictures of themselves, they take selfies all day long.â€
Who gives a shit?
Weâ€™re just jealous, I think weâ€™re jealous because we got one photo a year.
We had a day.
It was called â€œPhoto Day.â€
It was our only opportunity in a year to get proof of our existence, and we had to wait in line for five hours,
holding an envelope full of change?
You would get to the front of the line, you had one shot, dude.
Theyâ€™d be like, â€œAll right, say cheese!â€
[imitates shutter] â€œI think I blinked!â€
Heâ€™d be like, â€œSorry, brace face, see you next October.â€
Kids now, they can get eight tries till they get a good one.
We got eight sizes of the same shitty photo.
What were those sizes?
I remember being with my mom in the Walmart frame section, sheâ€™s in tears.
Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s this one? What is this, a 9Ã—1?â€
â€œI donâ€™t evenâ€“ is this a bookmark? I donâ€™t know what that was.â€
â€œWhatâ€™s this tiny little one? Is this for a locket?â€
â€œI paid 74 nickels for this bullshit!â€
I think we have to use critical thinking on this stuff, you know?
I know itâ€™s insensitive sometimes to say, but people will be like, â€œWhitney, the phones, they are really toxic for the kids.â€
â€œThe filters on Instagram, they give the kids body dysmorphia.â€
Okay, I have body dysmorphia â€™cause we used to xerox our faces.
Iâ€™ve never seen myself before because I fried my retina on the surface of the fuckinâ€™ sun, â€™cause that was the only way to get a selfie back in my day.
And then we would play with something called â€œpin art,â€ you remember that?
It was the red frame with all the little needles in it, and you put yourâ€“ put your hand, the outline, and your hand would goâ€“
Weâ€™d put it on our face!
[laughter and applause]
My generation needs filters to cover up the tetanus scars from jamming our head into a box of nails.
[sighs]
[applause]
I just think it might be the best-case scenario.
You canâ€™t let kids get bored, and when kids get bored, they do dumb shit, thatâ€™s it.
Like before phones, for our main form of amusement, we used to walk around the mall.
For five hours.
With no money.
You know some bad ideas are gonna bubble up at some point.
Twenty minutes in, weâ€™d be like, â€œOh, my God!â€
[groans]
â€œShould we just get in the van with that guy?â€
â€œLike, whatâ€™s the worst thatâ€™s gonna happen?â€
â€œHeâ€™s got candy.â€
Like, that was our Candy Crush, just a guy in the Penneyâ€™s parking lot with Wertherâ€™s Originals.
Wearing that exact shirt.
Umâ€¦
No, I just feel like itâ€™s just so odd to me, like when people come up to me after I talk about this stuff.
Theyâ€™ll come up to me, like, â€œWhat did your parents think of all that?â€
They didnâ€™t.
Our parents had no idea what we were doing.
My mom used to say to my face, â€œGo out and play. Come back before dark.â€
Kids donâ€™t know when itâ€™s gonna get dark.
Gets dark, and theyâ€™re like, â€œFuck, itâ€™s dark!â€
â€œNoooo!â€
â€œThis happens every night! Itâ€™s always a surprise!â€
And then we would just have to Blair Witch Project our way home.
Eventually weâ€™d find a pay phone, and youâ€™d have to pray that your mom would take a collect call.
You call your mom and youâ€™d be like, â€œYou have a collect call fromâ€“â€œ
â€œMom, itâ€™s dark! Come find us!â€
And then you would just hitchhike andâ€¦ that was kind of the deal.
Itâ€™s wild to think about because even when our parents were with us, they had no idea what we were doing.
My mom used to take me to birthday parties every Sunday, and we would play in something called a â€œbounce house.â€
Is that what you guys call it in New Jersey?
Are you sure? You guys seem rich.
Do you call it a â€œbouncy castleâ€? Donâ€™t lie to me.
[laughter]
Sheâ€™s like, â€œOkay, youâ€™re right, Iâ€™m a princess.â€
Umâ€¦
So youâ€™d roll up to the bouncy castle, right?
And I remember, even as a kid, I always thought that shit was sketchy.
I was like, â€œIâ€™m just a kid and I donâ€™t know anything about math, but, likeâ€¦ thereâ€™s, like, 70 pairs of kidsâ€™ shoes outside, but only, like, three kids inside.â€
No maternal alarm bells are going off.
She would just fuckinâ€™ leave.
She would leave, and you remember the screen outside the bounce house?
That was painted over, she didnâ€™t know what was going on.
You guys remember what was going on.
There was always that bully kid who was, like, hiding in the corner who had been practicing all day how to bounce.
He knew every sort of part.
He knew all the soft spots, he knew how to bounce, and he would just wait in the corner for new blood to come in.
You would come in there, youâ€™d be like, â€œIâ€™m on the moon!â€
Come outta nowhere.
Boom! Bounce you into the air, down into the crevice between the floor and the wall
where you would join nine other kids who had been there for five days, covered in their own blood and piss.
I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m trying to figure out what to do.
Iâ€™m trying to figure out how to be a good mother.
Iâ€™m not a mother, but I am a godmother. Is anyone a godparent?
-[scattered applause] -Yeah? Itâ€™s a fuckinâ€™ scam.
Itâ€™s a racket.
You fall in love with this child and you have no authority over them at all.
Then you just get yelled at by the parent, you know?
I get yelled at constantly.
All I do is try to do good things for this child.
I love her so much.
Every time she comes over, I get in trouble.
Like recently she came over, I had gone to a store.
I got all this organic, like, food, and, like, I made her a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, gluten-free bread, right, I think Iâ€™m in the clear.
And, uh, she comes over, and there was peanut butter on the sandwich andâ€¦ if you live in California and you put peanut butter on a sandwich and itâ€™s near a child, uh, Will Smith just comes out and punches you in the face.
Umâ€¦
[applause]
Itâ€™s like a new law.
So I got in trouble for that.
But then I got some other fuckinâ€™ almond butter thing and all this organic stuff, and sheâ€™s like, â€œI need to see the bottle,â€ and I was like, â€œItâ€™s organic.â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œHmm, even a lot of the organic brands have chemicals.â€
I was like, am I the only kid that drank out of a hose till I was, like, 14?
Dude, I remember the first time I went to a restaurant.
They brought me water, I was like, â€œEww, whatâ€™s this clear shit?â€
â€œI ordered water, the murky stuff that makes you go night-night?â€
â€œTry again.â€
â€œEcch! I already had to bring my own paint chips to this shit hole.â€
Iâ€™m always getting in trouble.
I guess I just donâ€™t know how to be a good parent.
Thereâ€™s all this new stuff you have to, like, know about, and I just feel like itâ€™s a little bit overkill, â€™cause I really try and I always end up in trouble every time I try to be in her life.
She recently got into ballet, all right? Sheâ€™s five years old, sheâ€™s in ballet.
Iâ€™m like, I have to go to the recital for that â€™cause thereâ€™s nothing cuter than toddlers in ballet because they all have, like, beer bellies.
For no reason.
They probably have tapeworms â€™cause they only eat fuckinâ€™ organic shit.
Just saying. And thenâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦their pantyhose never fit, right?
â€˜Cause no one wants to touch their legs â€™cause itâ€™s too awkward, so they all have like ball sacks on their knees and theyâ€™re just like these stupid little sumo wrestlers knocking into each other, so I was like, â€œI have to go to that, thatâ€™s hilarious.â€
And I did not get in trouble until the freakinâ€™ end after itâ€™s over, right?
I didnâ€™t say anything, I didnâ€™t talk about the ball sacks.
I totally behaved myself.
And then after the show, I went up to my goddaughter, and I was like, â€œOlivia, you did such a good job and you looked so pretty in your outfit.â€
My friend pulls me aside, she goes, â€œWhitney, get over here!â€
â€œWe donâ€™t say sheâ€™s pretty.â€
â€œWe say sheâ€™s smart.â€
I was like, â€œOkay.â€
â€œBut sheâ€™s not.â€
[laughter and applause]
â€œI am happy to lie.â€
â€œIâ€™m trying to understand what weâ€™re doing â€™cause the spelling beeâ€™s down the hall.â€
â€œMaybe we can pliÃ© down to the spelling bee â€™cause your kid canâ€™t fuckinâ€™ read yet â€™cause you let her choose her own classes.â€
â€œHow am I the asshole?â€
â€œYouâ€™re the one that bought lingerie for your baby.â€
â€œHow am Iâ€¦?â€
â€œI just watched you put mascara on your toddler in the parking lot.â€
â€œI feel like weâ€™re even.â€
She goes, â€œWhitney, you donâ€™t understand.â€
â€œThere is an epidemic in this country of girls that define themselves through their appearance over their intelligence.â€
I was likeâ€¦ â€œThat sounds true.â€
â€œBut thereâ€™s also an epidemic of hot girls who think theyâ€™re smart.â€
[laughter and applause]
â€œWhat are we gonna do about that?â€
â€œYou can make a difference today.â€
No, Iâ€™m always getting in trouble with her.
I have very strong feelings about stuff â€™cause I love her.
Sheâ€™s in ballet, and I feel like a toddler in ballet, totally fine, itâ€™s cute, but I feel like, as a girl, you cut ballet off at, what, like ten?
Eight, ten.
I basically said to her, â€œI donâ€™t think that toddlers need to keep doing ballet later.â€
Like, I donâ€™t think anything should exist today if you canâ€™t sell it right now as a brand-new idea.
I get why ballet was entertaining like 400 years ago, but I donâ€™t think it needs to still be a business based on what we now know.
Imagine trying to sell ballet as a brand-new concept to a Broadway producer right now.
Youâ€™d be like, â€œHey, I have this idea for a show.â€
â€œItâ€™s a dance show.â€
â€œItâ€™s about 20 18-year-old girls.â€
â€œThey dance for about two hours in underwear.â€
Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œBrrr, Iâ€™m sorry, is that like a burlesque-type show?â€
â€œNot at all.â€
â€œThey donâ€™t have tits or asses because we starve them.â€
â€œAnd their toes look like curly fries for the rest of their life.â€
Theyâ€™d be like, â€œUhhâ€¦ Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m just trying to understand this show.â€
â€œSo itâ€™s just women, thereâ€™s no men in the show?â€
â€œOh, my God, totally forgot to tell you.â€
â€œYes, there is one man in the show.â€
â€œHe is like 30 and heâ€™s the one that holds them up by their pussies.â€
â€œSorry, Iâ€™m just trying to wrap my head around this idea.â€
â€œUm, so theyâ€™re just in underwear? Is that the onlyâ€“â€œ
â€œOh, forgot to tell you.â€
â€œOf course theyâ€™re not just in underwear. We have skirts for them, obviously.â€
â€œBut we figured out a way to make them go straight out.â€
â€œSo you can still see everything you need to see.â€
[clicks tongue]
â€œIâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m justâ€“ [splutters] Iâ€™m not getting it.â€
â€œDo you want to just, I donâ€™t know, show me the dance moves?â€
Sheâ€™s like, â€œNo problem, itâ€™s very simple.â€
â€œThey just show their pussiesâ€¦ from every angle.â€
â€œTheir pussies fly. Theyâ€™re making the pussies fly.â€
â€œAnd then they just present their pussies to everyone in the audience.â€
â€œOne by one.â€
â€œYou know how you blow kisses at people? They just blow their pussies at people.â€
â€œDonâ€™t worry, we donâ€™t let them smile.â€
â€œMake sure they have no joy behind their eyes.â€
You can have one, of course, sir. Of course.
Ballet is a wild show!
Itâ€™s a wild show.
You know a showâ€™s creepy when they give the audience binoculars.
Like, why do they have binoculars?
Why do the binoculars have one handle bar?
Why do you need one hand free?
What is this show?
Itâ€™s called The Nutcracker, you guys!
[laughter and applause]

<START>
Whoa! Okay, yeah. Good. Okay, donâ€™t embarrass yourself, okay. Ohh, the expectations. Crushing, I would argue. Absolutely crushing, debilitating in every way. Iâ€™m gonna move this, â€™cause Iâ€™m so thin Iâ€™ll disappear behind it, soâ€¦ And then youâ€™ll be like, â€œIs thatâ€¦ Is that Kate â€œor is that Kate? Right? â€œI donâ€™t know who to watch. Is that the comedian, or is that the, uh, the mic stand?â€
Soâ€¦ So, the cameras. Big night for me. Yeah, really big. So thereâ€™s a camera, thereâ€™s a camera. Huh! You know, theyâ€™re everywhere. They can see you. We can see them. Itâ€™s an inherently false, um, moment, right? Itâ€™s a little bit scary. Theyâ€™reâ€¦ theyâ€™re filming. Theyâ€™re not actually filming. They are, but itâ€™sâ€¦ Is itâ€¦ is the camera inherently misogynist? Yes, right, soâ€¦ Am Iâ€¦ Am Iâ€¦ Do I feel attacked? Yeah. Right, itâ€™s veryâ€¦ Even the language. You know, â€œWeâ€™re shooting her. We shot her.â€ â€œWe got her. We have her.â€ Right, itâ€™s aâ€¦ You know, I feelâ€¦ Is it scary? Yeah, you knowâ€¦ Is what I do brave? Yeah, you knowâ€¦ It absolutely is. But I was, of course, forced into comedy at a very young age just because of my bone structure. But I didâ€¦ I chose to stay in it for this, the directness. Right? And I can reach out and I can actuallyâ€¦ Iâ€™m changing lives, and sheâ€™s crying. Sheâ€™s crying. Itâ€™s me, sweetie. You can touch, yeah, yeah. Very sweet. No, that was very sweet. That was very sweet. She was looking up at me, and she was like, â€œUh! I grew up with you in my home. â€œHow canâ€¦ Am I in my living room? Whatâ€™s going on?â€ And her friend was like, â€œGo for it, babe.â€ And she was like, â€œOkay, if you say so.â€ It was very sweet.
So, yeah. So itâ€™sâ€¦ great moment to have up top. Unprecedented, I would argue, to have such a direct physical connection with the audience, aside from the emotional one that Iâ€™m fostering already, and weâ€™re what, minuteâ€¦ Who cares? Iâ€™m not counting. You are, yeah. Butâ€¦ Out of breath from the physical comedy I did, so right nowâ€¦ I doâ€¦ One thing about me that is essential is that I do comedy primarily to process the overwhelming privilege of my childhood, umâ€¦ adolescence and now adulthood, right? If you can imagine growing up almost collapsing under the weight of resources. Right? Almost so many, right, that your gait is affected, right? If you can imagine my parents, you know, so loving. â€œYouâ€™re so special. We love you.â€ Right? Theyâ€™re actually not divorced, right? All of that, and somehow, with all of that weighing you down, just finding the strength to get to Zara. Just somehowâ€¦ Whoa! And sometimes Zaraâ€™s closed, Iâ€™ll be honest. This is actually my first time not performing for kids. Umâ€¦ I usually do myâ€¦ My sort of myâ€¦ My bracket is two to four. Thatâ€™s really where I thrive. And, you know, I do a lot of stuff kind ofâ€¦
â™ª Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday â™ª â™ª Where are my boots? â™ª
You know, and then Iâ€¦ The boots are gone, and then we do a scavenger hunt for the boots, and itâ€™s really fun, but tonight, Iâ€¦ I was like, no, no, no. I want to do adults. You know, I want to doâ€¦ I want to go verbal. I want to do the adult stuff. Itâ€™s really hard to have absolutely no comedic influences whatsoever. Umâ€¦ Well, I would say my influences are pottery, um, just engagement with the raw materiality of the earth, andâ€¦ small batch granola. I think just batches of granola that are made in such small quantities they actively resist capitalism. I think thatâ€™s it. Uh, and Carlin, yeah. I know I ooze an East Coast intellectualism, but Iâ€™m actually from Los Angeles, right here. Um, is anyone else born and raised in L. A.? Iâ€™m the only one! Soâ€¦ itâ€™s weird to be the only one, but itâ€™s such an incredibleâ€¦ You know, and people say, oh, you know, â€œHollywood. Itâ€™s a paper town filled with paper people.â€ You know, but itâ€™s so real, I actually think. Peopleâ€¦ if you were from here, youâ€™d know that what we do with our families is we go out to the docks every morning, â€™cause it really is an importâ€¦ No, itâ€™s an import-export town. So youâ€™ll see families at dawn, and we watch the barrels of the imports come in and the exports leave, right? And that kind of creates this beautiful choreography of commerce, and itâ€™s really exciting, and I cry every time that I see it. So itâ€™s emotional. But, yeah, I love it here. Itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s beautiful. I often walk around and, like, itâ€™s so lush I feel like Iâ€™m in Mexico, and then Iâ€™m like, â€œYou are. Itâ€™s a false border.â€ Right? So, yeah, yeah. Hope there are no cops here. I like that. This could be good. And then itâ€¦ But it would really be subversive if I took this all the way into the street, and then you were still here and never knewâ€¦ â€œSheâ€™s in San Diego. She just crossed the line into Pomona City.â€ I donâ€™t know about various cities. Umâ€¦ Yeah, because, maps, no. I wonâ€™tâ€¦ It always terrifies me when you see people going to the map store. â€œMap for one!â€ You know, and they bring itâ€¦ Theyâ€¦ â€œThis is what we worship in this house.â€ Right. Itâ€™s like, who made your maps? Right? Whoâ€™s benefiting off that system? Dead silence. No one cares, soâ€¦ And thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing here. Iâ€™ve actually been sent here by the government. To shine a flashlight in those dark corners of culture and go, â€œWho made your maps? You donâ€™t know, right? Well, now youâ€™re gonna know.â€ But Iâ€¦ But then, of course, the deep terror: I donâ€™t know either. Yeah, I donâ€™t even know what day it is. I donâ€™tâ€¦ Ask me what day it is. â€“ What day it is? â€“ Donâ€™t know! Iâ€™m an artist, okay. Iâ€™m more pulled by the tides. It is sometimes, Iâ€™ll admit it, hard being the only artist in the room. Umâ€¦ Sorry, the only true artist in the room. I am controlling the laughter tonight also. Just, you know, know that, so, yeah, shh. Ha ha ha. You know. A little less here and thenâ€¦ Okay. You were late, whoever that was, you were late. Okay. Mm. Two weeks till regionals. Weâ€™re screwed! Yeah. Yeah. â€œWe donâ€™t wanna practice.â€ Well, itâ€™s gonna be a lot of sad faces in the parking lot after the tournament. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m gonna say. Wow. Hmm. Thank you forâ€¦ for this. For giving me a safe place to heal tonight, forâ€¦ My work is, of course, endurance-based. Itâ€™s kind of about you enduring me. So this veryâ€¦ Yeah, it just means a lot. I am psychic, so, uh, is your name, likeâ€¦ Christine? Okay, itâ€™s fine. Umâ€¦ Hmm. Itâ€™s fine. Itâ€™s fine. Is there a Christine over here? Just â€™cause sometimes the energy does a direct transfer. Is there a Christine in this area at all? Christine-less. Wow. Well, itâ€™s bad luck. Corporateâ€™s not gonna like that. No. Yeah, I think the mirror, you know, itâ€™s just so interesting to perform in front of a mirror when I am a mirror for you. Right? For your fears, desires, anxieties, right? Soâ€¦ And youâ€™re also my mirror as the audience. You know, I look at you and Iâ€™m like, â€œI am the messiah.â€ You know, itâ€™s veryâ€¦ Or a messiah figure, I should say, but itâ€™sâ€¦ so thereâ€™s a lot going on here. Thereâ€™s actuallyâ€¦ Thereâ€™s actually three mirrors in the room. Youâ€™ll get it in a week. Call me. Okay. No, but the mirror, of course, also is the origin of narrative, film, the building blocks of cinema. Entertainment. The origin of entertainment right here. The first entertainment, of course, the cavewoman, or caveperson, looking in the river. â€œWhoâ€™s that? Ahh!â€ Delight in oneâ€™s image, eh? Spanking the river. Realizing, â€œOhh!â€ And thenâ€¦ and then the ripples. Oh, frames, frames of film, right. So it goes onâ€¦ Yeah, so itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s the river, the reflection, and then â€œCheers,â€ that would be next in line. And then me, yeah. Thatâ€™s the evolution of entertainment. I feel like Iâ€™m neglecting this side. Weâ€™reâ€¦ Iâ€™m so frontal. Iâ€™m so Western. Iâ€™m so American. The front, the front, the front. I want to see it all! Right? Instead of kind of not America. Kind of other ways to live, right? Kind of like getting my hair cut at home. Right, things like that that I donâ€™t explore. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, boy. A sale?â€ You know? And itâ€™s like, why? Why couldnâ€™t I go, â€œMake it at home.â€ You know, exceptâ€¦ But thatâ€™s a side neglect. So itâ€™s make it at home, yeah. Okay. Iâ€™ll work on it. Jesus Christ. Iâ€™m so sorry to try to find something in the moment. Iâ€™ll getâ€¦ Iâ€™ll get back to theâ€¦ the â€œAâ€ material. Okay, ten years ago, thereâ€™s nothing, soâ€¦ I sort of just for the moâ€¦ I kind of wannaâ€¦ Could I have a spotlight? I just want to really feel what that might be like. In theâ€¦ for the complete drama. Oh, wow. Can you believe that? Howâ€™s this? Howâ€™s this? Am I in it? Oh. Itâ€™s hard to receive. Iâ€™ll be honâ€¦ Isnâ€™t that wild? Right now, being in it, feeling it, itâ€™s soâ€¦ it brings up, â€œOh, no.â€ You know, it does. But I could. I could actually go to that place where I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know anymore. I donâ€™t know. Actually, it feels really good. Just, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ You know, it feels good to go there, â€™cause so often you have to, â€œI have the paperwork right here, sir.â€ You know, butâ€¦ but inside, I donâ€™t know. I think as women we fear our excellence so intrinsically. Weâ€™re taught to fear it so early, so the spotlight to really feel thâ€¦ I also just wonder, like, in this light, are my features too violently Hassidic, or could I pass for Italian, right? I wonder. I donâ€™t know. I canâ€™t quite tell. Mmm.
The makeup. I doâ€¦ I believe that women have the right to steal cosmetics 100%, by the way. I do want to say. Are you kidding me? We are forced into a system where we have to constantly pay for certain creams, powders, lotions, right? We have to pay for our own subjectivity. And, no, you know, if you donâ€™tâ€¦ if you donâ€™t have that, then the state wonâ€™t recognize you, and you canâ€™t get a job. Right? Soâ€¦ No, I have to contour my nose away to get a bank loan. Iâ€™m notâ€¦ I wonâ€™t do it. No, well, this lipstick tonight that Iâ€™m wearing actually is called Scarlet Empress, and, yeah, so the violence is truly never-ending, andâ€¦ it cost $30. If you pay for it, right? Butâ€¦ No, and by the way, Iâ€™m not advocating for stealing from small businesses, of course not. Iâ€™m talking about large corporations who factor theft into their annual budget, I think, heh. Butâ€¦ but have fun. If you can safely do it, have fun. Okay. Mmm. I was on my way to what I knew would be a disappointing massageâ€¦ and I realized Iâ€¦ I do think Iâ€™ll see a woman become president in my lifetime. I do, andâ€¦ No, I think itâ€™s cool youâ€™re not clapping, though. I think thatâ€™s cool. Umâ€¦ No, itâ€™s chic, you know. Itâ€™s not condescending. Youâ€™re not likeâ€¦ â€œWho run the world? Girls!â€ No, itâ€™s just very real. Youâ€™re like, â€œNo, weâ€¦ Itâ€™s time, andâ€¦â€ we anticipate that.â€ Soâ€¦ I do think Iâ€™ll see it. Butâ€¦ but I will say, I think for America to elect a woman as a president, sheâ€™s either gonna have to be so hypersexualized, like pornographically feminized to the point that she wins and immediately is like, â€œOh, no! Oh, no!â€ Gets into the Oval Office, is like dropping stuff. Like, â€œIâ€™m such a slut. Iâ€™m sorry.â€ Iâ€™m sorry.â€ Orâ€¦ or sheâ€™ll have to be so radically desexualized that sheâ€™s truly just a fridge on one wheel with a single eye, likeâ€¦ Thatâ€™s it!
I justâ€¦ I donâ€™t see America electing just a woman. Just a woman in pants whoâ€™s like, â€œI believe people have the right to live with dignity.â€ No. I donâ€™t see it. So, yeah, to recap, itâ€™s either hypersexualization or desexualization to the point of being artillery, just so itâ€™s clear. Oh, and I want to be clear. Like, I want the fridge. Like, please, Iâ€™m dying for the fridge. I go to museums. Nothing? Okay, andâ€¦ Iâ€™ll just take an afternoon, like absolutely. Oh, mysâ€¦ Yeah, no, Iâ€™ll go andâ€¦ to get inspired and to meet men, and Iâ€™llâ€¦ I always feel like I have this direct connection to kind of almost a past self. Like, Iâ€™ll lookâ€¦ I always find myself wandering the halls of theâ€¦ the rococo paintings and theâ€¦ and the Renaissance, and thereâ€™s always this incredible cornucapâ€¦ Iâ€™ll walk you though what happened. I meant to say cornucopia. Co-co-co! And I said ca-ca-ca. â€œCornucaâ€¦ Cornucapia? Never heard of it, Kate. The showâ€™s over, okay?â€ And thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s a professional. â€˜Cause someone else, â€œcornucapia,â€ theyâ€™d never notice, uhh! But meâ€¦ Corâ€¦ Iâ€¦ oneâ€¦ one little mistake like that, Iâ€™m not kidding, weâ€™ll go from the top. Iâ€™ll start this puppy over. I will. Okay, so the museum stuff, Iâ€™m gonna do it. Youâ€™ll see, itâ€™s not worth it, but, umâ€¦ Iâ€™m doing it! Okay, so sometimes, youâ€™ll be at the museum and Iâ€™ll seeâ€¦ I will see these paintings of these sort of beautiful cornucopias, and, uh, thereâ€™s a slaughtered rabbit, right, and the orange peel. You know what itâ€™s like. Youâ€™re a cultured group. And thereâ€™sâ€¦ Thereâ€™s always a wench just hovering just over the cornucopia likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s me, itâ€™s me. And also, I will say I can very easily become male, kind of look like the, um, the court jester, you know, with the pan flute, likeâ€¦ You know, thatâ€™sâ€¦ Iâ€™m eternalâ€¦ is, I guess, what Iâ€™m trying to say. Iâ€™m not really theâ€¦ the girl next-door. Iâ€™m the door! I donâ€™t know if anythingâ€™s ever happened to anyone here. Umâ€¦ I donâ€™t want to assume, right, but I will say growing up in my family, we didnâ€™t have wheat. Umâ€¦ but we had each other. Oh, we had the hope for wheat, so, in a way, itâ€™s almost like we hadâ€¦ Wheat!
Love this crowd! Thank you. To feel so bolstered, so supported in that moment was something I havenâ€™t felt in a really long time. Oh, ah! Butâ€¦ I was in here before all of you came, just waxing the floors, getting everything just so. I did found this theater. I founded the theater, and founded theater in general, orâ€¦ at least am seen as responsible with bringing theater to the West, butâ€¦ â€œJokes Aside,â€ which is the name of my book, but, ohâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I was in here alone, and as women weâ€™re socialized against seeing solitude as a space of productivityâ€¦ Write it down if you have toâ€¦ And so in doing that, I was like, â€œThatâ€™s activism.â€ Right, thatâ€™s itâ€™s right there. Right, so why even go on stage and do the work? Itâ€™s almost redundant. Butâ€¦ While Iâ€™m here, can someone just give me an emotion? I want to continue to act. â€“ Anger. â€“ Anger. Anger I think for me is really justâ€¦ Can I haveâ€¦ Can I have another? Weâ€™re not done. Can I have another? â€“ Acting nervous. â€“ Fear. Oh, whoa. Fear. Wellâ€¦ One more, â€™cause youâ€™re begging for it. â€“ One more. â€“ Thrill. Thrill. No, I like that, thrill. Thrill is really just in the most simple formâ€¦ Right? Because we actually hide what we feel. We donâ€™t show what weâ€™re feeling, right? An amateur would get up here and say, â€œOh, fear? Oh, no!â€ Right? But no. When youâ€™re actually afraid, youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m not scared,â€ you know. â€œDonâ€™tâ€¦ donâ€™t let him see.â€ Right? So thatâ€™sâ€¦ thatâ€™s what that is. Cool. Whew. A lot came up for that. That was actually good. I could actually feel myself locking in there. Somatically, I was like, â€œThis is acting.â€ Soâ€¦ that was absolutely helpful. While Iâ€™m in the spotlight, hit the track. Can you imagine? Thereâ€™s nothing, butâ€¦ I wish. Give me a couple years. No more spotlight! Okay, Iâ€™m over it, actually. Can we get out? Thank you. I could call back, butâ€¦ Oh, they want more? Whatever they need. Whatever the camera needs, right?
Oh. Cameras, cameras, everywhere. Cameras, cameras, donâ€™t you dare. You see me, but I see you. You say yes, I and sayâ€¦ Ugh, couldnâ€™t rhyme. Iâ€™m just checking in. I love you. Okay, great. It is helpful just to have that anchor. To have an anchor. Here, I would almost just almost end the sentence there. To have an anchor. Wow. Only because Iâ€™m really feeling it, did someoneâ€¦ yeah. Okay, did someone over here recently move? And Iâ€™m seeing Wisconsin. Iâ€™m realâ€¦ Wisconsinâ€™s being highlighted. Is anyone in this area from Wisconsin or have any relationship to it? Wisconsin! Okay, umâ€¦ Michigan. Did anyone here move recently? By the way, Iâ€™m fine. I need you, I need you, I need you. Relax. I need you supine. I need you trusting. Okay? I do this at the boardwalk every Sunday, okay? Iâ€™m fine. Now back to Wisconsin. No, thatâ€™s fine. Itâ€™sâ€¦ It might be somewhere else. Itâ€™s called an energy flare. Oh, Wisconsin? Oh, thank you, great. Thank you so much. See? So, Iâ€™m right. Yeah. You recently moved? Yeah, silent. I like that, okay. Iâ€™m seeing an injury. Not like Iâ€¦ Itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s healed. But did someone here have like a leftâ€¦ Is it their left angleâ€¦ ankle. Left angle? Cool, weâ€™re going from the top! Iâ€™m not kidding! I said angle instead of ankle. Unprofessionâ€¦ Oh, my God! Thatâ€™s radical. See, this actually looks like a plant. This is actuallyâ€¦ No, this is unfortunate, â€™cause this looks fake. Iâ€™ll only ask this. Is it your left side? Yeah. I can do more of like aâ€¦ Of a clear landing just forâ€¦ Yeah, good. God, it feels good. First of all, Iâ€™m sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Your hâ€¦ It goes your health, my show. Yeah. Is itâ€¦ is it aâ€¦ is it a break? â€“ Itâ€™s a sprain. â€“ A sprain. And it is my ankle. Yeah, so ooh! Oh, you didnâ€™t think I was really psychic, huh? Left ankle sprain. Was itâ€¦ Iâ€™m getting the sense that it was not sports-related. Um, itâ€¦ it was, butâ€¦ Well, I mean, it always is, like in the sense that you are in sport, that your body is in motion, but, yeah.
Iâ€™m not a sporty person, soâ€¦
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Were youâ€¦ What were you playing? I was in a spin class. Let this be a lesson. They will take your moneyâ€¦ they will ruin your family and your reputation, and theyâ€™ll send you on your way. Were you downtown? I was in Eagle Rock. So, yeah. Iâ€™ve always said, like, downtown is up here. You know? Like, youâ€™ll notice right now Iâ€™m downtown. Iâ€™m downtown. And for me, even when Iâ€™m uptownâ€¦ Oh, no, no! Ohâ€¦ Whoa, I almost tripped, and no one came to help, whoa! That actually was scary. There was a quick moment, and thenâ€¦ and notâ€¦ To not even feel a hand come up. â€œLet me help you. Youâ€™re just here toâ€¦ â€œYouâ€™re just trying to make me laugh. â€œLet me help you if you fall.â€ Right? But instead, â€œWork, work, work!â€ I guess I am alone up here. Itâ€™s goodâ€¦ No. Thank you for reminding me. Very good, very good. The wire, of course, kind of representing media, I think. The way itâ€™s snaking around me. The way media literally cannibalizes the female form. Right, youâ€™ll notice how itâ€™s snaking around. â€ Sure, tell your storyâ€¦ â€“ but on my terms.â€ You know, itâ€™s veryâ€¦ Yeah. Oh, yeah. 40 minutes right here. Can you believe this doesnâ€™t affect the sound? Can you believe that? This really isâ€¦ This is engineering. This isâ€¦ this is why we go to war is to protect this. I want to fight for this. I want to fight for my country with this, okay. Back to the ankle injury.
Is your name Rachel?
No.
Can you imagine that? I wouldâ€™ve been, â€œWhoo!â€ Do you haveâ€¦ a dog. No, I want a dog, though. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m picking up on, the urge. Last thing Iâ€™ll say or not, itâ€™s my show. Umâ€¦ Do you haveâ€¦ Iâ€™m seeing sisters. Do you have sisters? I have a younger sister. Yeah, so youâ€™re the second sister. So Iâ€™m seeing sisters, and itâ€™s you. You haveâ€¦ Itâ€™s you and your younger sister. Iâ€™m actually an only child. Go ahead, laugh. Youâ€™ve got one. Never seen one up close, huh? Go ahead. For those of you who donâ€™t know, an only child is somebody with no brothers, and you guessed it, no sisters. It used to make me sad as a child, but now I realize itâ€™s actually a gift, because I donâ€™t have to live under the crushing weight of the sexual tension that I know exists among all siblings, yeah. Thatâ€™s what I like when see people full, â€œOh, God, the truth!â€ Theyâ€™re crossing in. Thatâ€™s what I like to see. And by the way, thatâ€™s okay. Youâ€™re normal, okay? Any institution thatâ€™s like, â€œSex doesnâ€™t exist here,â€ itâ€™s â€™cause it does. And Iâ€™ll just say, like if I had a brother, forget about it, okay? Forgetâ€¦ aboutâ€¦ it. Cannot imagine. Sneaking a glimpse of him in his boxers at dawn, likeâ€¦ Before school. Heh! Long family car trips, no one else to talk to. Fall in love like that, okay? Itâ€™s easy. Itâ€™s easy. Getting picked up, being like, â€œOh, Josh, put me down! â€œStop! â€œUgh! You ripped my shirt. Yeah, I need yours. What else am I gonna wear to Easter brunch?â€ â€œMom and Dad arenâ€™t gonna be home for like an hour. â€œJust give me your shirt. Ugh!â€ Iâ€™m jealous. My, bring up some stuffâ€¦ And by the way, if youâ€™re uncomfortable, if you feel that, know that thatâ€™s for a reason, right? Thatâ€™s whyâ€¦ thatâ€™s why they wonâ€™t air this show live. They wonâ€™t stream this on the radio right now. And why do you think? â€˜Cause people will be driving. â€œOh, hereâ€™s my light.â€ They hear my voice. â€œI have a choice in life?â€ Veer off the road. A lotâ€™s at risk. Heh! There are cameras, but alsoâ€¦ there are cameras. Theyâ€™re watching. I am always pretty sure Iâ€™m being surveilled in bathrooms, so I will just be like, â€œI know!â€ It helps, â€™cause I want the person surveilling me to be like, â€œShe sees!â€ You know, I wantâ€¦ I want to feel that. I want to feel it. I want to feel that. If thatâ€¦ it thatâ€™s a crime, then take me back to the bishopâ€™s ranch. Ohh! I want to go back to the bishopâ€™s ranch. Huge theme emerging about the bishopâ€™s ranch. Umâ€¦ Incredible to feel that, and then touch it with that authentically and to know thatâ€™s where I belong. Itâ€™s something that I couldnâ€™t have planned, and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so excited to actually present to you, we have the bishop. Come on out! Yeah. In editing, thatâ€™ll beâ€¦ huge. â€˜Cause weâ€™re gonna CGI the bishop, and â€œOh, my God!â€ The people at home? â€œOh-ho-ho!â€ Yeah. Sorry. I want money, okay? And people love the bishop. Okay, okay!
Wrap it up.
Okay.
Ohh! Iâ€™ll say therapy, get in it now, you know? Is my therapist here? Christina? â€˜Cause you never know. Okay, wow. So youâ€™re not curious what I do. Yeah, I was just like, okay, okay. When people say theyâ€™re not in therapy, Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ you canâ€™t do karaoke forever. You know, you have toâ€¦ Oh, no. Your friends and family see what karaoke has become for you. Soâ€¦ Uh, sex. Umâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m not convinced. Iâ€™d say. Like, does it even have the power to transform the day? I donâ€™t know. I justâ€¦ Not to brag, but I probably had the best sex of my life recently, and like an hour and a half later I was furious at Bank of America. Like I donâ€™tâ€¦ Even the day, you know, couldnâ€™t be changed, soâ€¦ And I also, I do not appreciate the myth brutally propagated by media that sex is the one time in your life where youâ€™re able to finally shed the prison of your personality. That thatâ€™s when your mask finally drops. I find that during sex my mask has never been tighter. Like itâ€™s absolutelyâ€¦ And trust me, Iâ€™ve tried to likeâ€¦ You know? You know, Iâ€™ve tried, but itâ€™s never so much as slipped. I mean, itâ€™s reallyâ€¦ Ugh.
I actually think that the only time that weâ€™re truly released from the prison of our personality, the only time that our mask actually drops, is when we barf. I really think thatâ€™s it. â€˜Cause just the rawness, the animalism, thatâ€™s the only time in your life when yourâ€¦ your taste in art, your funny outgoing voicemail, right, your grant money, is irrelevant. Itâ€™s not there. Itâ€™s just about that. Itâ€™s also the only time in modern life when you arenâ€™t being advertised to. Thatâ€™s it. And trust me, theyâ€™ll find a way. Oh, theyâ€™ll get in there. Theyâ€™ll get in your toilet if they have to. Hmm. Oh, I love your laughs. Ohh, I love this moment! Ohh! Really, though, when I hearâ€¦ I hear kids. I hear little kids going, â€œWhereâ€™s my dad?â€ Right, I meanâ€¦ Really, though. Sometimes Iâ€™m up here and Iâ€™m like, â€œWhere are our dads?â€ Like, this is crazy. Did you know that youâ€™re born with your eggs? Iâ€™ll go back. If youâ€™reâ€¦ If youâ€™re someone who has eggs, youâ€™re born with them. Itâ€™s not like they developed during puberty. Can anyone confirm? This really blew my mind. Yeah. So what does this mean? This means that your mother, the day she was born, you were already inside her. The potential for you was already there. Can you go that far? Yeah. Crying, crying, crying, crying, crying.
Okay. So, what Iâ€™m trying to say is, weâ€™ve all been marinating in our motherâ€™s rage since the day she was born, and then her motherâ€™s rage, and her mother, her mother, on and on, okay? Weâ€™re all stewing in the rage of all the women whoâ€™ve come before us. Itâ€™s an intergenerational tajine of rage. And itâ€™s deserved, I want to say that, but itâ€™s been very helpful for me because Iâ€™ll be going about my day, everythingâ€™s fine, and then out of nowhere Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m gonna break glass,â€ you know? And Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m like, where does that anger come from? It doesnâ€™t feel like it belongs to me, and itâ€™s been very helpful to be like, itâ€™s actually maybe not mine. Itâ€™s my grandmother in Spain, like, â€œAah!â€ You know, thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s who it belongs to. So release. Release thyself. And, you know, honor it, but push through. I actually donâ€™t have kids yet, but my daughter right now is like, â€œMom, what are you doing up there? I can feel it.â€ â€œLove you, sweetie. Maybe weâ€™ll watch this together one day with Dad.â€
You probably have read in the news that Iâ€™ve been tucking in my blouses more. Sssâ€¦ And it does feel good. It makes me feel very together. Like I tuck in, and immediately I really do feel like I have children, like I just completelyâ€¦ I feel effective. Iâ€™m like, yes, absolutely, right here. I have everything I need. Immediately leaving the house with the blouse tucked in, Iâ€™m like thereâ€™s all these kids that are like, â€œOkay, come on. We gotta go. â€œWe gotta go. Weâ€™re gonna get in the car. â€œCan you tell me in the car? Can you tell me in the car? â€œOkay, great. Yeah?â€ Itâ€™s my husband. â€œUhâ€¦ okay. I couldâ€™ve used that information earlier, Iâ€™ll be honest, yeah.â€ â€œHow can I do that now? Uh, Iâ€™m just really asking. How can I do that now?â€ â€œNo, no, I asked you, andâ€¦ and I remember â€œâ€™cause I asked you yesterday. â€œNo, I know that you said no, but now youâ€™re saying yes. â€œOkay, yeah, okay. â€œOkay, say bye to Daddy. Say bye to Daddy. â€œYeah. Oh, hi. Yeah, okay, Iâ€™ll call you later. Bye.â€ Thatâ€™s the woman who lives next-door who I feel more connected to than my own husband. All of that, all of that with just imagination. Can you believe it? I want you out of your seats. Okay. I have no texts. Not possible, actually. Uh-oh. Remember her? You know what that means.
Yeah. Weâ€™re in the final quadrant of the show. Isnâ€™t that heartbreaking? Mm. Oh! Iâ€™m actually a huge gear nerd, so I usually bring my own mic, â€™cause I love to be likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s good! Weâ€™re set. Weâ€™re set. Okay. Life, like this show, is cinnamon in the wind. Itâ€™s justâ€¦ whoosh! You know, itâ€™s gone. Andâ€¦ youâ€™re just there left cursing the air like, â€œThere was spice here once.â€ You know, itâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s all it is. Itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s hard to admit, but, you know, life is short. Iâ€¦ I like that. Life is short, life is short. Write that down. Okay, weâ€™ll, weâ€™re filming, so thatâ€™s fine. â€œHoney?â€ Shh, my husband. â€œBabeâ€¦ write down â€˜Life is shortâ€™.â€ â€œLife is short. Iâ€™m just thinking here. â€œUh, live out loud. I like that. Write that down.â€ Okay. Heâ€™s jealous of what I do. Hmm-hmm. Umâ€¦ yeah, but itâ€™s true that this could really beâ€¦ Oh, no, not again. Right. No, but this really is me wrapping up formally. Um, people close to me know I hate to leave the stage, so this will not go well, I just want to tell you now. Itâ€™s not gonnaâ€¦ itâ€™s not gonna be a smooth one, but weâ€™ll get youâ€¦ Weâ€™ll land you there, okay? Weâ€™ll land you in Des Moines. Itâ€™s funny. Someone here tonight has the exact laugh of somebody who deceived me, and itâ€™s reallyâ€¦ Huh. Now youâ€™re quiet, right? Typical.
You do all look gorgeous, though, I have to say. When we started this show, you were all like this, â€œOh, the mortgage, the mortgage.â€ Right? And now youâ€™re so relaxed. Youâ€™re so open. â€œThe mortgage, the mortgage.â€ You know? And it is specialâ€¦ Oh, my Godâ€¦ Iâ€™m so sorry. Hello? Yeah! Iâ€™m at work. Why? Okay. Umâ€¦ like 30 minutes, yeah. Oh, itâ€™s going really well. Yeah, itâ€™s going well. Ohh, how is she? I said, â€œOhh, how is she?â€ Uh-huh. Oh, she not find it? Shit. Okay. Tell her to look under the bed, yeah. Okay. Okay, okay, great. Um, oh, I gotta go, but, umâ€¦ okay, perfect. I love you, too. Okay. Bye. Oh, my God. No, Iâ€™m sorry. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ so rude. First of all, I never wanted to be one of those comedians who took a call onstage. That is crazy, crazy rude, but thereâ€™s this guy Iâ€™ve been seeing for a while, and he just like told me he loved me, so right now Iâ€™m just like, oh, my God. So, Iâ€¦ immediately, the walls. Isnâ€™t that funny? Immediately. â€œOh, God, now I canâ€™t trust,â€ but itâ€™sâ€¦ I actuallyâ€¦ we do have that solid foundation of trust because he is my lawyer, so I feel like there isâ€¦ we have that, you know? Butâ€¦ hmm! Iâ€™m just laughing thinking about how fulfilling my private life is. Itâ€™s just crazy. I justâ€¦ And this is amazing. Like, I love being able to do this and connect like this, but then I go home to my boys, and itâ€™s just veryâ€¦ I have seven sons, umâ€¦ They are 4, 6, 2, 8, 9, 12, and two days. So I have a lot on my hands. Iâ€¦ Yeah, so I have to go home, but, umâ€¦ Oh, whatâ€¦ I canâ€™t think about my family for a minute? Okay, sorry, whoa! Okay! No, Iâ€™ll get back on schedule for sure. Jesus Christ! In case anyone cares, this whole night has been hell for me. Okay? In case anyone cares! Since the very beginning. Tick tock! Right? â€œGet to the point, bitch!â€ Right? Iâ€™ve felt that from you, so donâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ll be on my way, and you can go back to your perfect life without me. Jesus Christ.
By the way, Iâ€™ll just say, like, you paid to see me, but Iâ€™m the weirdo. Okay, got it! Yeah, all of you staring at me, but Iâ€™m the one who has a screw loose. Got it. Sure. Okay. No, Iâ€™m beingâ€¦ Itâ€™s not cool to, like, yell at you. Itâ€™sâ€¦ Iâ€™m, um, sad to leave, because until tonight, Iâ€¦ I didnâ€™t know what a family was. No, Iâ€™m serious. I had always seen inâ€¦ books andâ€¦ TV movie, things like that. I always saw this family, I always saw these happy people smiling, and I was always banging on the glass like this. â€œLet me in, let me in!â€ And I never could get in, and, umâ€¦ I guess tonight for the first time I actually kind of felt like I was sitting at the dining room table with everyone. So, um, thatâ€™s why itâ€™s hard for me to leave, but I have to leaveâ€¦ I have to get back, umâ€¦ Iâ€™m selling tank tops and stuff outside, soâ€¦ So I have to get back to that, but, umâ€¦ all good things must end, right? â€œWrite that down, babe! Thatâ€™s good, butâ€¦â€ But Iâ€™m gonna put on a happy faceâ€¦ and weâ€™re gonna get on with the show, right? Because it is a show, and thereâ€™s so much pressure on me. And donâ€™tâ€¦ justâ€¦ Just donâ€™t forget that tonight. Goodbye. No, okay! Ohh. Ahh. Come on! I have to leave? Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay. I actually have toâ€¦ Iâ€™m slashing material. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing right now. Itâ€™s really hard. Iâ€™m slashing. Iâ€™m slashing the good stuff. I had thisâ€¦ I did have this incredible closer. It was likeâ€¦ Mmm! You know, it was like really creamy and like brought together all these different littleâ€¦ Little variations on the show. It was like all the different threads of the show into this one finely woven tapestry. â€œHere!â€ You know? Butâ€¦ time. I just canâ€™t. Heh. Also, closers are gauche. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, oh, Iâ€™m realâ€¦ Hereâ€™s my big closer.â€ You know, itâ€™s likeâ€¦ uhh. You know, itâ€™s cheap. Itâ€™s cheap! And I donâ€™t want to belittle what we have with material. Like, blah! You know? Are we on a cruise? You know? Jesus. No, Iâ€™mâ€¦ I am likeâ€¦ delaying leaving. There is something I, like, donâ€™tâ€¦ Iâ€™ve been, like, putting off saying. Iâ€™m just gonna, like, rip off the Band-Aid and say it. Umâ€¦ mm! Why is this hard? Oh-kay. My name is not Kate Berlant. And Iâ€™m not a comedian. Umâ€¦ my name is Megan â€œredacted for my privacy.â€ Umâ€¦ but Iâ€™m actually the chief research analyst of Behavioral Science at Cornell University, and this has been incredible. Iâ€™ve been living as Kate for longer than Iâ€™d like to admit, studying the relationship between audience and performer. Things like that, but tonight, uh, itâ€™s over. This was kind of my magnum opus, was to perform as her for an hour. I canâ€™t believe so many people fell for it, but this is my night to sort of shed her, and itâ€™s beenâ€¦ Itâ€™s been amazing, but I do want to go back to my roots, my real passion, which is irrigation. Andâ€¦ yeah, just rerouting water systems, the bureaucracy of water, stuff like that, I really want to get into. Uh, so, yeah, Iâ€™m gonna shed Kate tonight, and with thatâ€¦ Good night!
Thatâ€™s not it, but can you imagine? No. Not gonna end on that, but, uhâ€¦ But, yeah, okay. Ohh! The chili sale. Theâ€¦ Okay. Iâ€™m selling chili. Uhâ€¦ I couldnâ€™t send you home with nothing. There is a chili sale happening, um, out front. There are three crocks. Theyâ€™re Mild, Medium, and â€œOh No She Didnâ€™t.â€ Itâ€™s kind of three differentâ€¦ And we encourage you to layer the chilis, right? Have fun with it. Theyâ€™re 3.99, yeah, uh, a cup. And please, please buy it. Know that all the proceeds go. Umâ€¦ Soâ€¦ so thatâ€™s great. Well, this has been explosive. Your words, not mine. But, umâ€¦ yeah, it really is time. I have to say when I first got here tonightâ€¦ I didnâ€™t know what to expect. I was like, Will the spirit be with me, right? Will tonight be a night I just go home, open up the Uber app, and watch the cars go? You know, is thatâ€¦ See, right there I couldâ€™ve left. That would have been good. That would have been professional, in fact. Okay, should we do house lights up? I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s so crazy. Hereâ€™sâ€¦ hereâ€™s my dirty secret. The showâ€™s over. No, but it reallâ€¦ It endedâ€¦ Yeah, seeâ€¦ By the way, look how casual I am. Is this thingâ€¦ No, you know. â€œWhere wasnâ€™t I?â€ Thatâ€™s the name of the show. Butâ€¦ Yeah, thatâ€™s the kind of casual kind ofâ€¦ Oh, my water. Wait, thereâ€™s a camera here? Oh, no. Damn it. I wanted to do this, and that, and the other thing.

[â€œHard to Killâ€ by Bleached plays]
[audience cheering and applauding]
Hello! Denver!
[cheering and applause continues]
[Patton laughs] Oh my God! Hello. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[cheering continues]
Thank you. Oh my God! Yes! Thank you all so much for coming out tonight. Umâ€¦ Hey, I broke my foot. Yeah. Thatâ€™s how I started my year. I broke my foot. Uhâ€¦ It wasâ€¦ It took twoâ€¦ It happened in two parts. Uh, the second part was I slipped off a curb and I landed wrong. That was the second part. The first and most important part was I turned 53. That is the crucial part.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€¦ You turnâ€¦ Once you get past 50, everythingâ€™s fatal. Iâ€¦ When I was in my twenties, I would walk into propellers and put some Bactine on it. I was fine. And now if a pine cone falls near me, my spine implodes. I donâ€™t know whatâ€¦ Like that. [audience laughs] Broke my foot, and then the day afterâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna drop a name. All right. Uh, the day after I broke my foot, Glenn Howerton, my friend Glenn Howertonâ€¦
[audience cheers]
â€¦who is almost 50, but for this bit heâ€™s over 50. I needed toâ€¦ Come on, who cares about logic? He broke his collarbone. So I called him up, gave him a little solidarity, a little support. â€œHey, man. I broke my foot.â€ â€œWhat happened?â€ In my mind, Iâ€™m thinking, â€œWell, he was probably reaching for a bag of SunChips wrong, and his collarbone broke or something.â€ And he said, â€œYeah, I was snowboarding. I landed a flip wrong.â€ All right. Fuck off. Fuck off.
[audience laughing]
You donâ€™t need to go to that much hassle. Once you get to a certain age, you donâ€™t needâ€¦ I donâ€™t even think thatâ€™s what happened. I think heâ€™s lying to me. I thinkâ€¦ I think somebody slammed a door near him, and then his collarbone fell into his ass cheek. And then he told his wife, â€œDuct-tape me to a snowboard and push me down a black diamond trail, please.â€ â€œGive me some dignity for Godâ€™s sake.â€ [audience laughing] Iâ€™m gonna drop another name. A month after I broke my foot, Tony Hawk broke hisâ€¦
[audience cheering]
â€¦broke his femur in two. Pow! Landed a vertical wrong. In his warehouse, doing his verticals, landed it wrong. Broke his femur. DMs me a picture of his X-ray. Heâ€™s like, â€œLooks like weâ€™re in the same boat, buddy.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, weâ€™re fucking not.â€ Youâ€¦ [audience laughing] You just Jackie-Channed yourself into even more coolness. [audience laughs] He found a whole other level of cool. I slipped off a curb like someoneâ€™s aunt that saw a bird. That is how I went down.
[audience laughs]
I went down in the most embarrassing way possible. [audience chuckling] And the one weird thing that happened, â€™cause when I did it I was still in my 23-year-old denial head of, â€œI just twisted my ankle. Iâ€™ll drive home.â€ I was at work. â€œIâ€™ll drive home. Iâ€™ll be fine.â€ Driving home, itâ€™s hurting worse. â€œOh, this actually might be a real thing.â€ I get home. I can barely get out of the car now. And Iâ€™m limping across the street to my house. And itâ€™s really hurting, and then a car pulls up, these two women are driving, and the driver rolls her window down and says, â€œYou okay?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, I twisted my ankle. I live right here.â€ â€œIâ€™m going inside, put some ice on it.â€ And then, and this haunts me, she said, â€œWell, donâ€™t give up.â€
[audience laughing]
Whichâ€¦ Wait. What? Holy shit! What was the look on my face? [audience laughing] What did Iâ€¦ Did sheâ€¦ â€œHeâ€™s gonna kill himself. Pull over. Pull over.â€ â€œHey, donâ€™t give up.â€ â€œLet me play this Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush song. Thisâ€™ll reallyâ€¦â€ â€œLetâ€™s listen to this.â€ Maybe that was just my face left over from the shutdown and the pandemic. Is that how my face permanently is now? Because I didnâ€™t do the shutdown well at all. I did a bad shutdown. I planned a great shutdown. I planned an amazingâ€¦ Remember when the shutdown happened? Supposed to stay home, and you had that little memory of all the times you said, â€œIf I could just get a month off, I could get my shit together.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œI could get my lifeâ€¦ I just need a month off.â€ I planned a great shutdown. I executed the worst one ever. Oh my God, the list I made. The list we all made. We all made the same list? Yes, you did. All the great books you were gonna read. All the great books. All the skills you were gonna learn. Oh my God, we couldnâ€™t wait to work on ourselves. If I had actually followed the list that I made, thereâ€™d be a different man standing in front of you right now. Heâ€™d be 30 pounds lighter. Heâ€™d be speaking fluent Italian.
[audience laughs]
When all of you walked in, there would have been a handmade raspberry almond crumble tart on everyoneâ€™s chair, on each chair. I would have hand-milled the flour this morning. [audience laughing] You would have eaten it off of an origami plate. [audience laughs] When youâ€™re done eating, you throw the plate down, it pops up into a frog. Oh my God! Oh, the plans I had! [audience laughing] I didnâ€™t do any of that shit. I ate Doritos for breakfast, and I watched Deadwood twice all the way through. Watched it. Finished it. Back to episode one. Hit play.
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s all I fucking did. And then I went crazier than a barn full of clown pubes. That is what I did during the shutdown. And listen, when Iâ€¦ When I say, â€œCrazier than a barn full of clown pubesâ€¦â€ [audience laughing] â€¦Iâ€™m not kink-shaming. Iâ€™m not judging. [audience laughs] Clowns have as much right to have a varied and experimental, adventurous sex life. Iâ€™m saying the source of the crazy isnâ€™t the clown pubes. Itâ€™s the having the thought and then the follow-through of â€œIâ€™m gonna fill this barnâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œâ€¦with the pâ€¦â€ I just want that to be clear. That the source of the crazy is the barn. The barn full of pubes isnâ€™t even the crazy. It was the act of filling the barnâ€¦ Listen, if youâ€¦ If you just filled a barn with pubes, youâ€™ve checked off the crazy box. [audience laughing] But this person went, â€œIâ€™m putting obstructions in my way.â€ â€œI will only collect the pubâ€¦â€ Also, how do youâ€¦ Thereâ€™s no way to know. Clown pubes donâ€™t look different. Like, theyâ€™re not bright orange. Theyâ€™re not rainbow-colored. Look. Some are, but a lotâ€¦ Thereâ€™s a lot ofâ€¦ Listen. Thereâ€¦ Thereâ€™s a lot of non-clown pubes that are bright orange and rainbow-colored. Thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m saying here. What Iâ€™m saying is thereâ€™s no way thatâ€¦ Okay, this is what Iâ€™m saying. Wait. Fuck. Okay. If youâ€¦ Like, okay, if youâ€™re walking aroundâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€¦and thereâ€™s a barn, and you open those two big doors, thereâ€™s a wall of pubes, and you go, â€œWell, thereâ€™s a maniac roaming the countryside.â€ If someone said, â€œThose are only clown pubes.â€ Like, â€œOh! We gotta call the National Guard.â€ Wait a minute. What? â€˜Cause thereâ€™s no way to prove that. [audience laughing] Oh, okay, wait. You could do this. Every timeâ€¦ Every time that you collectâ€¦ Notâ€¦ Not aâ€¦ Not a clump. Thatâ€™s gross. Not a clump ofâ€¦ No. [audience laughing] Clump is too gross. Thatch? No.
[audience laughs]
Thatch is too folksy. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s the otherâ€¦ Like, if Cracker Barrel opened a BDSM store, they would call it the Thatch of Pubes. Thatâ€™s what it would be called. Youâ€™d go down to the Thâ€¦ Itâ€™d probably be connected to the Cracker Barrel. Youâ€™d go in, get a nice breakfast, then go, â€œHang on. I gotta pop into the Thatch of Pubes.â€ [audience laughs] â€œPay the bill. Iâ€™ll meet you at the front.â€
[audience laughing]
Thatch of Puâ€¦
â™ª Thatch of Pubes â™ª
[audience laughs]
[laughing] Weâ€¦ â™ª Weâ€™ve got nipple clamps And scented lubes â™ª
[audience laughs]
Weâ€™ve got floggers, and paddles, and dildos. Oh my! And a tower of butt plugs that kisses the sky. [audience laughs] Tell â€™em Petunia the pube pig sent ya. [audience laughs] Oink. All right. Umâ€¦ [audience laughs] Handful. Handful of clown pubes. Thatâ€™s non-gender specific. Every time you collect a handful of clown pubes, you take a Polaroid. You have a Polaroid, so youâ€™re kneeling down. Youâ€™re collecting the pubes. You got your baggy. Gotta do it full length. Get the whole clown in there. He or sheâ€™s gotta be in their wig, their makeup, holding that dayâ€™s newspaperâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦so you know. Then you take a hole-punch, punch a hole through the Polaroid, get a ribbon, put it through that hole, tie the other end of the ribbon to theâ€¦ theâ€¦ the handful of pubes, toss it in the barnâ€¦ Every handful of pubes is accounted for. There you go. And thatâ€™s how you would proâ€¦ Fuck, no. No, you canâ€™t. You know why? No, that doesnâ€™t work, because then someone can go, â€œTechnically, you didnâ€™t fill the barn with pubes because the ribbon and the Polaroid took upâ€¦â€ No, it has to be complete confidence in the speaker and total trust in the listener. When you say I thoâ€¦ This is whatâ€™s happening right now, okay? Weâ€™re starting this set out. Letâ€™s go on a journey for the next hour. I started off pretty strong, I think. I think Iâ€™ve won your trust, but you know what? You shouldnâ€™t 100%â€¦ No. Not yet though.
[audience laughing]
Because what youâ€™ve gotâ€¦ Listen. What Iâ€™ve done, comedically, creatively, I have opened the barn doors. [audience laughing] And thereâ€™s a wall of pubes. [audience laughing] And yes, itâ€™s impressive, but youâ€™re right to go, â€œYou know what?â€ â€œI bet that wall of pubes, I bet thatâ€™s a half an inch thick.â€ â€œAnd thereâ€™s a big sheet of plywood behind, and the rest of the barn is empty.â€ â€œIâ€™ve been screwed over too manyâ€¦â€ Youâ€™re right to think that. What Iâ€™mâ€¦ This is what Iâ€™m doing. As a comedian, Iâ€™m inviting youâ€¦ Iâ€™m saying I want you to run as hard as you can into this wall of pubes, and then, I want you to fight your way back, just fight your way to the back of the barnâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦until youâ€™re cocooned in pubes. You know what I mean? At the back. And when your hand hits that back wall, you will think, â€œI met a man of honor.â€ That is what you will think. [audience laughing] That is what I want for us. Not me, not you, us. All of us. Thatâ€™s what I want. Those are the kind of bits I wrote during the shutdown. Iâ€™d be awake for eight days in a rowâ€¦ [applause] Five in the morning, â€œThe fucking Polaroid doesnâ€™t even work!â€ Goddamn it! [audience cheering and applauding] I bought a trampoline.
[audience laughs]
Not a giant backyardâ€¦ One of those little workout ones. Yeah. Little tiny trampoline. Itâ€™s called a rebounder. Awesome. You get up on it. You hop up and down, get the lymphatic system going, â€œHere you go. Ooh. Out, in. Forward, back. Ski it out.â€ Great workout. Got it right at the beginning of the pandemic. â€œIâ€™m gonna stay fit during this thing, man. I got my new rebounder.â€ It came out of the box, not a speck of dust on it. Oh, I was so excited. I could feel how excited the rebounder was. You could feel it. He was like, â€œIâ€™m gonna make a difference in this house.â€ â€œI belong here. Iâ€™m gonna change things for the better.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s right, little rebounder. Wanna go inside the house?â€ â€œYou wanna go in the gym?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYeah.â€ We have a gym in our house. Itâ€™s a room with an elliptical in it. We call it a gym. [audience laughs] I take him inside. Oh, heâ€™s so excited. I put him down. â€œIâ€™ll see you tomorrow, little rebounder.â€ He goes, â€œYeah.â€ We both looked over at the elliptical. [audience laughs] Against the wall. Clothes hanging off of it.
[audience laughs]
Covered in dust. And I could feel the rebounderâ€™s heart break. I could feel hisâ€¦ You know what it felt like? It felt like the rookie cop fresh out of the academy. Heâ€™s like, â€œGive me the worst precinct in town. Iâ€™ll turn it around!â€ â€œIâ€™ve got progressive policing techniques, community outreach.â€ â€œIâ€™ll make a difference.â€ And he shows up that first day, big thermos of green tea, little keto lunch, heâ€™s all excited. Looks over in the corner, â€œWhoâ€™s at his desk?â€ The old homicide cop. [audience laughs] Eight bullet holes in him. Eleven colostomy bags. [audience laughing] Heâ€™s having his seventh Viceroy of the morning. [audience laughing] [Patton exhales] Thatâ€™s the elliptical. [audience laughing] Looks at the little rookie rebounder, â€œYouâ€™re gonna learn, kid.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYou think I didnâ€™t have dreams when I came here, huh?â€ â€œI was top of the line!â€ â€œYou can stream movies on me, TV shows, mountain programs, everything!â€ â€œOh! I was gonna turn this house of fatties around.â€ [audience laughing] â€œThat guy that just dropped you off, he was on me day one.â€ â€œCute little workout outfit.â€ â€œLittle iPhone. He downloaded a bunch of podcasts on it.â€ â€œOoh, a thinker!â€ [audience laughing] â€œHe gets up on me, stretch those little fat thighs, pumping them up and down.â€ [grunting] â€œThought he was gonna go the distance.â€ â€œHe didnâ€™t make it past the first Blue Apron ad.â€ [inhales, exhales] [audience laughing] â€œHopped off of me.â€ â€œWent and checked his texts in the crapper.â€ [audience laughs] â€œHe never came back.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œOh, heâ€™ll be here tomorrow.â€ â€œOh, heâ€™ll be in his little workout outfit.â€ â€œHeâ€™ll probably put a little playlist on his iPhone.â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œHeâ€™s a Gen X-er in his fifties.â€ â€œI bet itâ€™ll be all early â€™80s New Wave pop.â€ [audience laughs] â€œThatâ€™s how heâ€™s gonna get thin. Nostalgia.â€ [audience laughs] â€œHeâ€™ll hop up on you, start jumping up and down like a gibbon full of Skittles.â€ [audience laughs] â€œWhatâ€™ll be the first song he listens to? I can call it right now.â€ â€œItâ€™ll be the Go-Goâ€™s â€˜Our Lips Are Sealed.'â€ â€œThatâ€™ll be the first song.â€ â€œAnd youâ€™ll be all excited. â€˜Oh, heâ€™s gonna go the full hour'â€! â€œHe wonâ€™t make it past the bridge.â€ [audience laughs] â€œThe minute Jane Wiedlin starts singing, â€œHush my darling,â€ heâ€™ll hop off of you, heâ€™ll check his texts in the crapper.â€ â€œHeâ€™ll never come back.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œExtinguish all joy within you, and nothingâ€™ll ever hurt you again.â€ [audience laughs] I just pitched the saddest Pixar movie in theâ€¦ If they do a movie with the Safdie brothers, thatâ€™s gotta be their movie. Harvey Keitel is the elliptical. [audience laughing] TimothÃ©e Chalamet is the rebounder. [audience laughing] And Frances McDormand is the half-inflated exercise ball. [audience laughs] Went fucking crazy during the shutdown. My rock-bottom, psychologically, during the shutdown happened on the same day as my wife and daughterâ€™s. We all hit crazy rock-bottom at the same time. Um, it was a weekday. Weâ€™re all in the house, staying inside. Doing our part. Stop the spread. My daughterâ€™s in the kitchen, and out of nowhere, she says, â€œHey, thereâ€™s a weird guy in our backyard.â€
[audience laughing]
What the fuck? I go running out, â€œWhat?â€ Looking out, â€œI donâ€™t see anybody. You saw someone?â€ She goes, â€œSome weird guy just walked across our backyard and went around the back. Heâ€™s back there right now.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh shit!â€ We have cameras all over the property. I have an app on my phone. You click it and can look at what the camera sees. Iâ€™m waiting for it. Iâ€™m gonna go back and confront him. I just wanna know what Iâ€™m about to deal with. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s back there. What if itâ€™s a lost hippie wanting someone to hacky-sack with him? â€œIâ€™ll hacky-sack with you.â€ [audience laughing] Could be a maniac, nude, with a bucket of chicken on his dick, holding a sword. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s backâ€¦ I just wanna be ready. [audience laughing] But the cameras arenâ€™t loading, and Iâ€™m waiting for it. Goddamn it. And then my wife pushes past us, doesnâ€™t say anything and goes striding across the back lawn. Sheâ€™s got a white summer dress on flowing in the wind, barefoot. And sheâ€™s holding a pink, aluminum baseball bat. [audience laughing] And she has serious Manson girl energy coming off of her, likeâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€œLook at that hot, hippie chick that I wanna fuck and get murdered by.â€ â€œYay.â€ [laughing] So, sheâ€¦ It takes me a second to realize what sheâ€™s doing, then I go clomping after her, in my flip-flops and cargo pants, but sheâ€™s already around the corner and sheâ€™s already laying into this guy. Before I can turn the corner, I hear her screaming at him, â€œWho the fuck are you? Get the fuck out of my yard!â€ â€œI will fuck you up.â€ [audience laughing] [audience cheering and applauding] Soâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I turned the corner. Sheâ€™s in a stance. [audience laughs] Like Uma in Kill Bill, sheâ€™s ready to go. [audience laughs] The guy sheâ€™s yelling at, little scruffy looking, didnâ€™t look crazy, didnâ€™t look homeless, holding a cell phone, just looked a little off, and sheâ€™s screaming and yelling at him, â€œWhat the fuck are you doing here?â€ Now Iâ€™m gonna stop the story and tell you what was actually happening. There was something wrong with our air conditioner. Iâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I called our contractor and said, â€œCan you send someone to the house to fix the AC?â€ Without telling us, he gave this guy our address and gate code and sent him to the house. So yes, massive misunderstanding. My wife is now screaming at him, and sheâ€™s just fuckingâ€¦ Just blazing Valkyrie, shrieking at the top of her lungs at this guy, â€œWho the fuck are you?â€ Now, to his discreditâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦when there is a blazing-eyed Valkyrie holding a vagina-colored piece of metalâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦threatening to kill you, answer in short, declarative sentences. [audience laughing] [applause] This guyâ€¦ This guy was going, â€œWhoâ€™s anybody really, man? Likeâ€¦â€ â€œEvery day wasâ€¦ Oh, the wheel in the skyâ€¦â€ Oh, goddamn it. Now sheâ€™s got both hands on the bat. Sheâ€™s gonna swing on the guy. And then he looks at me. And when he looks at me, thatâ€™s when he gets scared.
[audience laughs]
He started saying, â€œMy name is Michael. Your guy Steve sent me here to figureâ€¦â€ And my wifeâ€™s like, â€œOh my God, he didnâ€™t tell us. Iâ€™m so sorry.â€ â€œOh my God, Iâ€™m gonna call him right now.â€ â€œIâ€™mâ€¦ This wasâ€¦ This really got off on the wrong foot.â€ â€œHow about you leaveâ€¦â€ The guy was more than happy to leave. [audience laughs] Iâ€™m sure he was driving home going, â€œThat poor bastard. Oh my God.â€ â€œIâ€™m sure the sex is amazing butâ€¦â€ Umâ€¦ [audience laughing] A lot of you hear the story and go, â€œThatâ€™s not very manly of you.â€ â€œYou let your wifeâ€¦ God knows what couldâ€™ve happened!â€ I argue the opposite. [audience laughs] I say that our timing and placement made us a more effective home invasion deterrent. [audience laughs] â€˜Cause remember he never got scared when she was screaming at him? He just kept going, â€œIâ€¦â€ You know why? He couldnâ€™t process what he was seeing.
[audience laughs]
Gorgeous Valkyrie, vagina-colored metal, screaming. Too much. Too fucking much. Couldnâ€™t process it. And also, again, the energy sheâ€™s giving off is outer-space sex vixen about to murder you. [audience laughing] Canâ€™t process it. You know what he could process? Me. Standing five feet behind her, â€™cause the energy I was giving off was, â€œI canâ€™t do nothing when she gets like this.â€ â€œIâ€¦ I tried to get her to go to the nervous hospital, see?â€ â€œShe said sheâ€™d burn the house down.â€ â€œSheâ€™s killed so many Amazon delivery drivers.â€ â€œI canâ€™t dig no more holes in the desert. Please just run!â€ [audience laughing] Iâ€™m doing some poses that we can freeze for the Netflix save screen. A littleâ€¦ [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] [Patton chuckles]
[audience laughing]
Thereâ€™s gotta beâ€¦ What if I didâ€¦ What if I useâ€¦ Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m gonna do. Watch. Like this. [audience laughing and cheering] Now, look. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s not a bit in the special, but if youâ€™re watching Netflix, and that â€œcoming up next,â€ youâ€™re like, â€œLetâ€™s watch a minute of that.â€ Like, â€œWhat the fuck is this?â€ [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] Iâ€™m vaxxed and boosted. Yes, I am. Thank you. It shouldnâ€™tâ€¦ [cheering and applause] Thank you. Butâ€¦ Thatâ€¦ Look. Thank you. Itâ€™s also sad that gets applause at this point, isnâ€™t it? You get applause for taking the most basic care of your health? Thatâ€™s like me going, â€œFolks, I wipe after I shit. Thankâ€¦â€ No. No, no. [cheering and applause] People. No. Iâ€™m noâ€¦ Iâ€™m no hero now. Itâ€™s the lumberjacks who cut down the trees that make the toiletâ€¦ Those are the heroes. [audience laughing] [man] Yeah! [chuckles] I assume thereâ€™s a lumberjack here. All right, umâ€¦
[audience laughs]
[Patton chuckles] Or a really enthusiastic wiper. Umâ€¦ [audience laughing] I got my vax right when the vax came out. Immediately. I didnâ€™t jump the line. I didnâ€™t use my privilege, butâ€¦ I acted on some inside information, and I feel bad about this. This is how I did it. Uhâ€¦ Right when the vaccine came out, I have a friend, lives out in Riverside. And he calls me and says, â€œI donâ€™t know if I should tell you this, but, uh, out where Iâ€™m living, itâ€™s MAGA country.â€ â€œNo one is getting the vaccine.â€ â€œThereâ€™s a Rite Aid near me, a woman sitting at a table.â€ â€œEveryone that walks in she asks if they want it. No one will get it.â€ â€œTheyâ€™re throwing crates of this shit out the back.â€ â€œIf you drive out here, you will get a shot.â€ â€œDonâ€™t even make an appointment.â€ So I drove out there. I walk in. Thereâ€™s a woman at a table. I go, â€œHi, excuse me. Iâ€™d like to get a vaccine.â€ She was like, â€œYou would?â€ Like, she had noâ€¦ [audience laughing] She had run out of Tolkien novels to read. Like, â€œYeah. Let me get you set up.â€ Like, â€œGo stand over there.â€ While Iâ€™m waiting, my friend was right, everyone that walked in, â€œWould you like a vaccine?â€ â€œNo, thank you.â€ And one guy gave her a, uhâ€¦ â€œ[scoffs] Yeah, no thanks.â€
[audience laughs]
Like, â€œYeah, nice try, Deep State. I think Iâ€™m gonna, uhâ€¦â€ â€œI think Iâ€™m gonna stay tracker-free for the time being if thatâ€™s all right.â€ â€œHang on. Yeah. Iâ€™m at the Rite Aid again. Yeah.â€ â€œThey tried to get a fucking trackâ€¦ Hang on. Iâ€™m losing you.â€ â€œThere you are. Yeah, no. Iâ€™m off the grid, man. Thatâ€™sâ€¦â€ â€œRight. Iâ€™ll call you later.â€ Got my shot. Got my second shot, then boosted twice. Iâ€™m fucking fine. In 1955, the polio vaccine came out. 1955. We were two years away from satellites. There were no satellites! And America could not have been more backward, racist, homophobic, sexist, and these non-satellite-having, racist dipshits lined the fuck up to get their fucking vaccine! [cheering and applause] What the fuck! [cheering and applause continues] â€œGive me that shot. I canâ€™t police these water fountains from a wheelchair.â€ [audience laughing] â€œI canâ€™t beat up queers inside an iron lung! Give me my science!â€ â€œWhat am I, a caveman?â€ [audience laughing] Now itâ€™s the year 2022, which, first off, doesnâ€™t sound like a real year, does it? [audience laughs] Doesnâ€™t that sound made up? Like youâ€™re watching a cheap science-fiction film, â€œIn the year 2022â€¦â€ â€œOh, youâ€™re just throwing numbers together. Jesus!â€ â€œWho wrote this shit?â€
[audience laughs]
Itâ€™s 2022. We have robots on Mars. They send us TikTok videos. [audience laughing] Half of the countryâ€™s like, â€œThat needleâ€™s got witch poison in it, I tells ya.â€ â€œYou ainâ€™t putting no witch poison in me.â€ [audience laughing] [chuckles] â€œKeep your wizard jab away from me.â€ â€œI got to watch the video that the Mars robot sent to the world brain I keep it in my pocket.â€ [audience laughing] â€œBut keep all that science away from me.â€ If that attitude had existed in 1955, the government would have had to do one of those PSAs, like a little cartoon dancing, hypodermic needle coming out, you know. [audience laughing] â€œWho do I gotta blow to cure polio?â€ Like littleâ€¦ [audience laughing] [cheering and applause] Yes. Thatâ€™s right, jabby. Tell everyone about your benefits. [audience laughs] â€œMy benefits? Your fucking legs work. Howâ€™s that for a benefit?â€
[audience laughs]
â€œYou medieval shitheads.â€ [audience laughing] Itâ€™s a different world now, man. Itâ€™s a different world. Isnâ€™t it? Cruise ships? Oh, youâ€™ll never see a cruise ship again. Kiss that goodbye. Our grandkids wonâ€™t know what a buffet is. Oh. [audience laughs] Fuck, Covid changed everything. First off, every cruise ship is booked up to the year 2026. People cannot wait to get aboard the plague barge and sail the bounding main. â€œOh, let me die near a water slide!â€ [audience laughing] Not only are buffets gonna come back, theyâ€™re gonna come back with this weird, own-the-libs vengeance. Every one of themâ€™s gonna have an agenda. â€œCome on down to Captain Covidâ€™s Alpha Males Only buffet!â€ [audience laughing] â€œYou the kind of left-wing soy boy that needs a sneeze guard over your clam chowder, or are you able to fuck your wife?â€ â€œThen come on down to Captain Covidâ€™sâ€¦â€ [audience laughing] â€œYou show us proof you ainâ€™t been vaccinated, you get a free platter of room-temperature scallops.â€ [audience laughing] â€œThatâ€™s right.â€ [chuckles] Ohâ€¦ I was listening to â€™70s on 7 on the way here. Yeah, on my XM Sirius satellite dial. You like â€™70s music? You hit number seven. All the â€™70s music you can have, â€™70s on 7. You like â€™80s music? You hit number eight.
[audience laughs]
â€™80s on 8. Do you like â€™90s music? Guess what you hit. Number nine! [audience laughing] Do you like â€™40s music? Well, you donâ€™t hit number four. You used to, â€™40s on 4. Now, channel 71. â€™40s Junction. You like â€™50s music? Well, itâ€™s channel 72. â€™50s Gold. You like â€™60s music? Seventy-three, â€™60s Gold. Why did those three channels get moved to the outer rim of the XM Sirius universe? I will tell you why. Their listeners are dying. [audience laughing] â€™40s, â€™50s, â€™60s. Those listeners are dropping likeâ€¦ The fucking â€™40s channel has five listeners left. [audience laughing] Three World War II veterans and a couple of contrarian hipsters. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s left. â€œYou know whoâ€™s punk rock? Artie Shaw.â€ Fuck off.
[audience laughing]
And we can laugh and enjoy it, but hey, during our lifetimes, â€™70s, â€™80s, â€™90s will go marching up the dial. Thatâ€™s how you can track how the generations are dying, by where theyâ€™re putting the stations. [audience laughing] Keep the â€™70s, â€™80s, â€™90s easy. I hope when they do that, that they take a little time and give some consideration to the names the way they did for the â€™40s channel, â€™40s Junction, train station, evocative. I get it. Picture in my head. And then they just gave up. â€™50s Gold, â€™60sâ€¦ Ah, who careâ€¦ What? You couldnâ€™t do â€œPoodle Skirts and Milkshakesâ€? You couldnâ€™t do â€œPatchouli Oil and Love Beads,â€ or whatever? [audience laughing] Give the â€™70s channel a name emblematic of the decade. You know, â€œYour Mother and I Are Separating Radio.â€ How about that? Thatâ€™s good. Sure. [audience laughing] Yeah. â€œGiant Candles Everywhere For Some Reason Tunes.â€ [audience laughing] The â€™80s could be â€œTrapper Keeper Tunes.â€ [audience cheering and applauding] And then the â€™90s channel could just beâ€¦ [groans] [audience laughing] [groaning] I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ That was Abra Mooreâ€™s â€œFour-Leaf Cloverâ€ onâ€¦ [groans]
[audience laughing]
[groans] [audience laughing] Hi. Do you live here in Denver, maâ€™am? I live in Colorado Springs. [Patton] You live in Colorado Springs? Nice. Thank you for making the drive. [woman] No problem. Okay. What do youâ€¦ [laughing] Okay, glad I got that straight. It wasnâ€™t a problem. Thank God. Okay. Guys, it wasnâ€™t a problem. Itâ€™s cool. [audience laughing] [Patton chuckles] Do you work in Colorado Springs? What do you do? Iâ€™m a doctor. [Patton] Youâ€™re a doctor. Oh my God, a brainiac. All right, umâ€¦ What kind of medicine do you practice? Iâ€™m a pediatric neurologist. Pediatric neurologist. Oh my God! [audience cheering] Youâ€™re likeâ€¦ [cheering and applause] You are serving your community. You are helping children. You have a positive job that you have a positive attitude towards. This is comedy death. I need to get off of you right now. Thereâ€™s nothing here. [audience laughing] I need to talk to a meth cook or a divorcee. This isâ€¦ [audience laughs] â€œI help children live.â€ [sliding beep] All right. Shit. [audience laughing] Is this, uhâ€¦ Are you with her? You guys together? Is this the hubby? The husband. The husband. What do you do, sir? Iâ€™m a lawyer. [Patton] Youâ€™re a lawyer? Ahâ€¦ [audience laughing] [kisses] Finally.
[audience laughing]
Some evil. [audience laughing and applauding] Oh God, if itâ€™s some kind of positive community outreach law, Iâ€™m gonna fuckingâ€¦ What kind of law do you practice, sir? I prosecute juvenile sex crimes. You prosecute juvenile sex offenders. Wellâ€¦
[audience laughing]
When you say juvenile sex offenders, do you mean people who commit sex offenses against juveniles, or juveniles who are sex offenders? Juveniles who are sex offenders. Juveniles who are sex offenders. Gotta be very careful with the phrasing. And when you sayâ€¦ And then what happens? Like, they getâ€¦ Why am Iâ€¦? What is this, aâ€¦? I gottaâ€¦ Me sitting down was good for that one laugh. Iâ€™m not gonna do the rest of my show like, â€œSo what do you do?â€ [audience laughing] What the hell am I doing?
[applause]
You are prosecuting the juvenile sex offenders. Okay. And you are a neurological pediatrician. So a kid whose brain maybe isnâ€™t working correctly, you help fix it. And the ones you canâ€™t fix, he puts away, right? Is that howâ€¦ [audience laughing] There we go. [audience laughing] Thereâ€™s your next Marvel team-up. All right. Soâ€¦ [laughs]
[audience laughing]
That was cute and dark at the same time. Rare to find that. Itâ€™s like a goth girl holding a kitten. All right. [audience laughing] How about you? Do you live here in Denver?
[man] I do.
You do? What do you do in Denver? Uh, I work in a bar and Iâ€™m a student. You work in a bar and youâ€™re a student. Oh, itâ€™s a 1980s Tom Hanks movie. All right. Soâ€¦
[audience laughing]
What are you studying right now? Uh, cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. And then, by day, he patrols the Internet. At night, itâ€™s Slippery Nipples for secretaries, right? [audience laughing] What, uhâ€¦ So youâ€™re a bartender, and so do you want to eventually work in cybersecurity? Obviously. [man] Yeah. And the bartendingâ€™s paying the bills. Paying for you to learn. What is theâ€¦ Whatâ€™s the scariest thing youâ€™ve learned so far in terms of cybersecurity? How close are we to some huge hack attack where suddenly the ATMs donâ€™t work and all of our porn searches are on the internet? When does that happen? [audience laughs] Umâ€¦ Pretty much nothing is private. [Patton] Pretty much nothing is private. Well, we all know that at this point. Thatâ€™s notâ€¦ Oh my God, have you everâ€¦ Okay, when you were growing up, was there, like, some asshole that bullied you or was really shitty, and now that youâ€™re learning your cybersecurity skills, you could go digging into this personâ€™s life and just dis-fucking-mantle it if you wanted to?
[audience laughing]
Has that temptation ever crossed your head? Pretty frequently. Have youâ€¦ Oh! Have you done searches of old bulliesâ€™ names and stuff like that? Iâ€™veâ€¦ Iâ€™ve chosen not to. Youâ€™ve chosen not to. [audience laughs] That is a very lawyerly response. That wasâ€¦ Did you catch that? [audience laughing] Oh, man. Is this the wife or girlfriend? Uh, yes. [Patton] Which one? [laughter] Girlfriend. [Patton] Girlfriend! Oh! And what do you do? Iâ€™m an educator. [Patton] Youâ€™re an educator. And what do youâ€¦ Thank you. [cheering and applause] Wow. What, uhâ€¦ What do youâ€¦ What areas do you educate in? I help high schoolers, um, access free college credit. Help high schoolers access free college credit. Does theâ€¦ Thatâ€™s cool. Does the, umâ€¦ Does the sleeve tattoo help break the ice when theyâ€™re like, â€œSheâ€™s coolâ€? â€œSheâ€™s all right.â€ Yep. That must help. [woman] It does, yeah. Do you go in with the sleeve tattoo visible? Or do they make you wear a long sleeve? I bust it all out. [Patton] You bust it all out, sit thereâ€¦ â€œLetâ€™s get you some fucking credit while you look at The Gashlycrumb Tinies right there, man. There you go.â€ You got some ink too. How long you been going out? Three years. Four. Three or four years. Three or four years. [audience laughing] Mmm. Some cybersecurity, if you know what Iâ€™m saying. Ah, come on, people. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Are youâ€¦ Do you live together? Oh, nice! Are you gonnaâ€¦ She looks awesome inâ€¦ And then he can get you, like, free credit card shit and everything. I mean, come on. [audience laughs] Itâ€™s a match made in heaven. Make it happen. Couldnâ€™t he use his cybersecurity to get kids free college credit? Change their grades, get them into Harvard. Thereâ€™s another fucking team-up. All right. [audience cheering and applauding] I have two superhero teams in the front row. Oh, hello sir. [audience laughing] Shorts in the front row. Ballsy. [audience laughing] Thatâ€™s it. You have way more self-confidence than I will ever have. Do you live here in Denver? I do. [Patton] And what do you do in Denver? I work in Boulder, actually. You work in Boulder. Live in Denver, work in Boulder. What do you do in Boulder? I work for a grocery store. You work for a grocery store. With that facial hair? Theyâ€™re cool with that orâ€¦? [laughter] Whatâ€¦ Iâ€™m not gonna ask what grocery store. Thatâ€™s weird. [man] I bet you can figure it out. Probably could. Hang on. What is your specific job at the grocery store? Iâ€™m a manager. Youâ€™re a manager at the grocery store. Do you manage the whole store or one department? Umâ€¦ Yeah. [audience laughing] Yeah, part of it. Yeah. Part of it. The liquor section? What part do you, umâ€¦?
[audience laughing]
You seem amazed at hearing that youâ€™re working at a grocery store coming out of you. â€œI work at a grocery store! Iâ€¦â€ [audience laughing] [Patton chuckling] And, uh, who are you here with? Is this your friend? Thereâ€™s your friend. And where do you work? Uh, I work from home. You work from home. [man] In sales. In sales. I sell light bulbs. [Patton] You sell light bulbs. Are you asking me? You seem to be like, â€œI sell lightâ€¦â€ Youâ€™re answering my questions like Iâ€™m a homicide cop. Youâ€™re like, â€œI-I sell light bulbs?â€ Like, itâ€™s notâ€¦ [audience laughing] You sell light bulbs from your home. Iâ€™m a lighting salesman. Youâ€™re a lighting salesman, so you stay in your house. You call people up or get on the internet with them? On the internet. On the internet. And you try to sell them light bulbs. Absolutely. Individuals or corporations? Both. [Patton] Both. Thatâ€™s so fucking weird. [audience laughs] I justâ€¦ I donâ€™t know howâ€¦ So you get on Zoom calls with them, and go, â€œReally quick, turn on all your lights.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œItâ€™s pretty shitty, huh?â€ â€œWell, Iâ€™ve got a solution for you.â€ [laughing] [audience laughing] Youâ€™re not far. Thatâ€™s so fucking interesting. Okay. You two are delightful, and you are not a superhero team. Iâ€™m sorry. [audience laughs] That isâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what the hell you are. Thereâ€™s a guy who works at a Traderâ€¦ Doesnâ€™t quite know what he does there. Another guy gets on Zoom calls and sells light bulbs. I think you have a weird OnlyFans. Youâ€™re just covering for it now. You donâ€™t really sell light bulbs. [man] Itâ€™s the DC Universe. Oh, DC Universe. Veryâ€¦ Ohâ€¦ Iâ€™ll do the nerd shit, my friend. All right. [audience laughing] Donâ€™t you dare! [audience laughing] That was a fun front row. Give them a round of applause. Thank you, guys. Wow. [cheering and applause] I love the flow of that. You know, doctor, lawyer, cybersecurity, educator, sort of groceries, light bulbs, I guess. I donâ€™t know. [groans] [audience laughing] Perfectly paced. [kisses] [audience laughing] [sighs] You know what doesnâ€™t age well? Woke. [audience laughs] It really doesnâ€™t. Iâ€™m woke, I think. But you know what? I wonâ€™t be someday, and so will all of you.
[audience laughs]
Be woke. Be open-minded. Just donâ€™t pat yourself on the back, â€™cause itâ€™ll bite you in the ass. Everyone getting cancelled now for not being woke was woke about something, they just couldnâ€™t keep up with progress. Progress will always fucking steamroller you. Iâ€™m very pro-trans, very pro-gay marriage, gay rights, and pro-aborâ€¦ No, no, no. No. No. [cheering and applause] Thatâ€™s notâ€¦ What Iâ€™m saying is that is going to blow up in my face someday. Iâ€™ll be doing comedy when Iâ€™m 70, and I will let slip something that I wonâ€™t be able to keep up with. Iâ€™ll be like, â€œI donâ€™t think people should fuck their clones.â€ â€œBoo!â€ Thereâ€™ll be some weird, likeâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€œNo wait, Iâ€™m pro-trans.â€ â€œFuck you, clone hater!â€ [audience laughing] â€œNo, Iâ€™m totally progressive!â€ #Stopclonehate, then I gottaâ€¦ Then Iâ€™ll double down. â€œWhen I grew up, you didnâ€™t jerk off in a test tube and fuck whatever came out of it! If that makes me the bad guy, Iâ€™m sorry!â€
[audience laughing]
â€œBoo!â€ [Patton chuckles] By the way, thatâ€™s how you know if youâ€™re aâ€¦ uh, if youâ€™re an oppressed minority, or, you know, a fringe group that used to be shit on, and now you know that youâ€™ve made it when straight, white people start asking you if jokes are okay. Thatâ€™s when you knowâ€¦ The trans community really broke through because all of a sudden, straight, white peopleâ€™ll be like, â€œIs this okay?â€ â€œDoes this joke work? Is that okay?â€ You know. But either way, that means in the future, straight, white people are gonna be the minority, then theyâ€™re gonna have assholes like, â€œHey, Iâ€™m doing a joke about a straight, white dude, and, um, I have him bowling. Is that okay? You guys bowl, right? Like thatâ€™sâ€¦â€ [audience laughing] â€œItâ€™s not offensive?â€ â€œHeâ€™s listening to Limp Bizkit, â€˜ironically, â€˜ okay?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œItâ€™s ironic. Iâ€™m doing it ironically.â€ [Patton chuckles] Goddamn, these last six years. Holy shit. I was in such a panic in 2016, then all the subsequent years, â€œWhat the hellâ€™s going on? Oh my God. Is America coming to an end?â€ No. You know what? It isnâ€™t. Itâ€™s bad right now, but everything thatâ€™s happening is supposed to be happening right now. Do you know what 2016 was? It was the boomersâ€™ last temper tantrum.
[audience cheering]
Thatâ€™s what that was. [cheering and applause] The boomersâ€™ last temper tantrum. Every time a generation gets old, they panic because death is scary and gross, and they put someone shitty in the White House before they go. This has happened before. The greatest generationâ€¦ The greatest generation, oh my God, fought the Nazis, saved the world from tyranny, came back, built the suburbs, raised the baby boomers, then they started getting old. Hair turned gray, dick didnâ€™t work anymore, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies. They panicked. Now itâ€™s the late â€™70s. Punk music, they donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on. â€œFuck this.â€ â€œPut the old cowboy movie actor in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!â€ â€œI was here, goddamn it!â€ [applause] Then the baby boomers grew up. Think of the baby boomers. They were on the cutting edge of sex, rock and roll, rebellionâ€¦ They owned youth, and then they got fucking old. [audience laughing] And their hair got gray, and their dick stopped working, hemorrhoids and hysterectomies, fucking Gen X and Gen Z making fun of them on Twitter and TikTok. All this hip-hop music they donâ€™t understand. Now theyâ€™re, â€œOh my God, Iâ€™m about to die. What the fuck is going on?â€ â€œPut the racist game show host in the White House. Yeah, fuck you!â€ â€œI was here!â€ [laughter and applause] Iâ€™m Gen X. Well, our temper tantrum is going to be beyond ugly. [audience laughing] When we start getting old, our dicks stop working, our hair goes gray, God knows who weâ€™re gonna put in the White House. Itâ€™s gonna be either Eddie Vedder or Janeane Garofalo. One of those two. I donâ€™t know. [cheering and applause] Look. I love those guys. Janeane would be a horrible president. [audience laughs] Iâ€™ve known her since the â€™90s. I love her. She would tell you that herself. Janeane, you should be president. â€œIâ€™m not doing that shit.â€ Oh my God, wait a minute. Thatâ€™s how sheâ€™ll win. [audience laughs] Think of how Gen X thinks. Like, â€œThatâ€™s exactly the attitude we need.â€ [audience laughs] Thatâ€™s perfect. â€œNo, Iâ€™m serious. Iâ€™m not doing it.â€ Yeah, we know, yes. [audience laughing] Sheâ€™ll blow off a debate. She wonâ€™t campaign. She wonâ€™t show up to her own inauguration. Yes, thatâ€™ll be awesome. Weâ€™ll love her even more. CNN will have a ticker on the bottom of the screen, like, â€œDay 312 of the president not showing up.â€ [audience laughing] Itâ€™ll cut to her in some coffee shop. â€œI told you I wasnâ€™t gonna run.â€ [audience laughing] And then weâ€™ll die, and we wonâ€™t be here to see what Gen Z puts in the White House. President Logan Paul. I donâ€™tâ€¦ Look. I donâ€™t know. [audience groaning] President Joe Rogan. [audience groaning] He wouldâ€¦ People, listen to me. Iâ€™ve alsoâ€¦ Iâ€™ve known Joe since the â€™90s. He is a sweet guy. He has gone off the rails. You know why? â€˜Cause someone gave him a hundred million dollars. [audience laughs] That would drive anybodyâ€¦ Heâ€™s actually handling it better than I would. [audience laughs] If I had a fucking podcast about knitting and someone gave me a hundred million, I would fuck yarn on my podcast! [audience laughing] And Joe would be like, â€œPatton went fucking nuts. Oh my God.â€ [Patton chuckles] Aging isnâ€™t bad if you donâ€™t take it personally. Thatâ€™s the key, you know. Treat it like itâ€™s aâ€¦ Pretend youâ€™re Jeff Goldblum in The Fly, and youâ€™re watching all this weird shit happen. Youâ€™re like, â€œOh my!â€ Get a leather-bound notebook. Take notes, you know, late at night, likeâ€¦ â€œOh. My farts smell like old books.â€ â€œThatâ€™sâ€¦ Hmm.â€ [audience laughing] â€œBut Iâ€™m not eating old books. Thisâ€¦â€ â€œThis calls for further examination.â€ [audience laughing] â€œDay 17. Takes longer to stop peeing than it does to pee.â€
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s coming for all of us. Iâ€™m gonna leave you with this story about my, uhâ€¦ Another breakdown that I had. Foot, all of it, itâ€™s all coming apart. But you know what? Weâ€™re living in the 21st century and itâ€™s okay. Always keep that in mind. Last year, last November, I had to have some minor surgery, right? And Iâ€™m gonna tell you the story. Iâ€™m gonna use a little AP English zhoosh to keep it from being horrifying, â€™cause it is. I had to have some minor surgery, the kind of surgery that, um, Iâ€™ll put it this way, men my age who sit down a lot have to have. See where Iâ€™m going? Soâ€¦ And Iâ€™m worried. Still Covid. â€œOh my God, what if I get an infection?â€ But I forgot I live in the 21st century. I have all these advantages in the plus column. On the day of the operation, I summoned a car with my phone. The car came. The guy was masked. I was masked. Car was clean, took me to the hospital. Doctor met me, showed me all the cleanliness protocols they had. He said, â€œThis surgery, weâ€™ve refined it.â€ â€œIt only takes an hour. Youâ€™ll be out for an hour.â€ â€œYouâ€™ll go home today.â€ He put me under. I wake up an hour later. Oh my God, Iâ€™m fine. He goes, â€œYou are fine.â€ â€œHere are some cutting-edge painkillers to help you with your recovery.â€ â€œYou wonâ€™t feel a thing.â€ â€œNow take out your phone and summon another car.â€ â€œYou live in the 21st century.â€ And I did, and the car took me home. And when I got home, I had a device onto which I could call, from the air, movies, books, television shows, music to entertain me while I recovered. Twenty-first century. When I left the hospital, the doctor said, â€œThereâ€™s a certain bodily function, that youâ€™re used to doing every day.â€ â€œAnd for the next few days, youâ€™re not gonna do it.â€ [audience laughs] â€œAnd then, after three or four days, all of a sudden, you will do it.â€ [audience laughing] â€œBut the first time you do it, it will be doing you.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œThereâ€™s no shame in it.â€ â€œItâ€™s gonna happen, part of the recovery.â€ â€œGo heal in peace.â€ I go home. First day, I watch movies. I read books on my iPad. I go to sleep. Nothing happens. Next day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. Nothing happens. Third day, watch movies, read books on my iPad, go to sleep. 3:30 in the morning. [audience laughing] It happens. But I wake up as itâ€™s happening and I can feel it coming. Iâ€™m half a second ahead of it. Oh my goodness, itâ€™s not gonna be a disaster. I hop out of bed. Everythingâ€™s okay. I make it across the bedroom floor. I get into the bathroom. Iâ€™m ten feet away from the toilet. Iâ€™m gonna make it. [sings suspenseful melody] Boom! No.
[audience laughing]
I had managed to get my underwear and sweatpants off. [audience laughing] Which made things ten times worse. [audience laughing] Because now, our pristine white-tile bathroomâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦was decorated for autumn. How about that, huh? Yeah. [audience laughing] Happy Thanksgiving. Soâ€¦ [audience laughing] Iâ€™m standing there going, â€œOh my God, Iâ€™ve got two choices. I can either clean myself off, or risk my wife coming in and seeing this disaster, which she doesnâ€™t deserve.â€ So, I do the second choice. I clean up everything first. I get a bunch of towels. I get everything all cleaned up in a big, gross wad. I gotta take off all my clothes, including my shirt. Iâ€™d ruined my shirt. [audience laughing] Physics. Soâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Take the whole wad down to theâ€¦ And Iâ€™m nude now. Go down to the kitchen with this big wad of horror, take the bag out of the can, put this in the bag. Now, four in the morning, I gotta walk to the end of my driveway where the trash cans are. Get the thing open. Drop it. And I just stand there. [audience laughing] Nude. [audience laughing] 4:00 in the morning. And I just looked at the moon. [audience laughing] Like, hours ago, I was in the 21st centuryâ€¦ [audience laughing] â€¦with access to cutting-edge technology, medicine, transportation. And now, just a mere couple of hours later, I had been revealed as the naked ape I always was.
[audience laughing]
[applause]
[cheering and applause]
The naked, shit-covered ape thatâ€™s inside all of us. And I actually had a weird moment of peace, â€™cause it was so awful, and Iâ€™m just like, â€œYou know what? Iâ€™m actually as far away from the 21st century as I could possibly be right now.â€ â€œIâ€™m actually closer to my Neanderthal forebears.â€ â€œThereâ€™s something weirdly cleansing about this.â€ And I had that feeling for, like, ten seconds. Thatâ€™s when I remembered all my neighbors have ring cameras on their doors.
[audience laughing]
So everybody got their Christmas card that year.
Thank you so much, Denver!
[cheering and applause]
Thank you! Thank you, guys. Thank you! Thank all of you.
[â€œHard to Killâ€ by Bleached playing]
[kisses] Thank you!

[audience cheering, whistling]
[emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Burr!
[cheering and applause]
All right, thank you! Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. How are ya? Howâ€™s it goinâ€™? All right. You guys standinâ€™ up, sit down. Sit down. See if Iâ€™m funny. Iâ€™ve been inside for a year and a half just like you. All right. Itâ€™s nice to be out here in Denver, man.
[cheering]
[chuckles] Itâ€™s legal on a state level, but not on a federal level, man. Everybody out here dressing like theyâ€™re fuckinâ€™ goinâ€™ hiking. [chuckles] Your North Face pajamas and all this shit you guys have. You guys all live inside. So, how have you guys been doinâ€™, man? How has your pandemic been? You enjoyed it? You been staying inside? Are you being safe?
[man] No!
I am so fed up with peopleâ€¦ â€œI ainâ€™t beinâ€™ safe! I donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ believe in it!â€ â€œItâ€™s all a bunch of lies!â€ Weâ€™re just totally divided. The people that are like, â€œYou gotta get vaccinated.â€ â€œYou have to wrap yourself in an afghan, and you gotta cover your face and hold your breath when you look at pictures of people.â€ And you got the other side, â€œI donâ€™t give a shit!â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna have my balls out, walkinâ€™ down the street, â€™cause thatâ€™s what Jesus said in John 13.â€ â€œI read it in my bible study class. I donâ€™t give a fuck.â€ â€œAnd if I get it, Iâ€™m goinâ€™ to the hospital and be like, â€˜All right, fix me, you were right.'â€
Everybody, all hypocritical. All the liberals, â€œYou gotta wear the mask, gotta wear the mask.â€ Then half of them when they talk, theyâ€™re pullinâ€™ it down. They got it up under their fuckinâ€™ nose.
Then the other assholes, they were all patriotic for years. â€œAmerica, love it or leave it!â€ â€œSupport the troops!â€ â€œYou donâ€™t like it, get the fuck out.â€ â€œAmerica, love it or leave it.â€ All right, take the vaccine. â€œWell, I donâ€™t trust the government.â€ Where the fuck did that come from? I thought you were all about it. I thought you were waving the flag and all of that shit.
Listen, hereâ€™s the deal. Weâ€™re never gonna solve this shit until we all get on the same page, which we know is never gonna happen, itâ€™s never gonna happen. So, we gotta set up some Hunger Games shit to solve it. And whoever wins, wins. Itâ€™s the non-vaxxers versus the vaxxers. So thereâ€™s a giant field, and all the people who donâ€™t want to get the vaccine, all the fatties and the fuckinâ€™ lunatics, right? You gotta fuckinâ€™ run the length of the field and try to make it to the other side while thereâ€™s a helicopter flying over you and theyâ€™re shooting the vaccine down at you. All right? And I know what youâ€™re thinkinâ€™, â€œWell, that ainâ€™t fair, man.â€ â€œIâ€™m runninâ€™ in my shit-kickers, youâ€™re up there in a helicopter and you got a gun.â€ Well, hereâ€™s how weâ€¦ Itâ€™s a liberal with a gun, right? Theyâ€™re not good at that. Say, â€œOh, my God, is it alive? Is it gonna hit me?â€ â€œI donâ€™t feel safe!â€ And by then, youâ€™re already halfway there. One of the straps of your overalls is off. If you make it to the other side, in the end, just like dodgeball, weâ€™ll just score it. â€œWho won?â€
Itâ€™s an idea, I donâ€™t know. I justâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what else to do. Iâ€™ve kind of quit. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got to be honest with you. For the first like, you know, year of this shit, I was an American, you know, and I was rootinâ€™ for everybody, and then, I donâ€™t know. They let us outside for a couple of weeks and then they sent us back in, and I just didnâ€™t have it in me anymore. Itâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t care. I just donâ€™t give a shit.â€ â€œYou know, I hope a lot more people die, I really do.â€
But the one good thing about this whole pandemic shit, and I really hope by the time this fuckinâ€™ thing comes out that this will be considered old, I donâ€™t know, God willing, but the one great thing about this pandemic shit is it kind of slowed down a little bit of that cancel culture. You know what I mean? Yeah. Itâ€™s kind of hard to take your dick out at work when youâ€™re at home. You know? Some people still manage to do it. Theyâ€™re on a Zoom call, no pants on. All of the sudden, standing up, their chunk right in the screen. Still figured out a way to get fired. It was unreal. Itâ€™s kind of good, though, that those creeps got to take a break, â€™cause I felt like cancel culture, they were kind of running out of people to cancel. You know? As much as they wanted to make it seem, there really was a finite amount of people that took their dick out at work. Despite the stats, right? â€œEvery 1.6 seconds, somebody takes their dick out and shakes it in a womanâ€™s face in a cubicle.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œWhat? Every 1.6 seconds?â€ I must not have been paying attention. â€œEvery 3.2 seconds, some man jizzes on a fern and rubs it in a womanâ€™s face.â€ Holy shit! I didnâ€™t know that. Right? Yeah. So fortunately they rounded up all of these fuckinâ€™ animalsâ€¦ and they got rid of them, right? But it kind of became like this cottage industry and it was a way to kind of get rid of some men that maybe were in your way, you know? Itâ€™s like anything. You know, the initial thing, you agree with it, and then it kind of gets out of control. So, I donâ€™t know. But it kind of ran out of people and there was this hilarious moment, like last year where they started to try and cancel dead people. Remember that? All of the sudden, out of nowhere, John Wayne was trending. Have they got some found footage, a new movie coming out that maybe they shelved? Then all of the sudden it was all these stupid-ass â€œwokeâ€ white people, right? â€œOh, my God, did you see what John Wayne said in Playboy in 1971?â€ Can youâ€¦ this is a bunch of fuckinâ€™ white people all up in arms about a dead white guy. â€œI can no longer tolerate this.â€ â€œI can no longer tolerate dead-for-45-years John Wayne saying things in a magazine that doesnâ€™t exist anymore.â€ â€œI am here for Black people.â€
These fuckinâ€™ idiots. What kind of a fuckinâ€™ idiot white person refers to themselves as â€œwokeâ€? You know? If you actually were socially conscious, youâ€™d realize that white people stole that word from Black people. Once again doinâ€™ the Elvis thing. Right? But you know what, I blame Black people for that. One of them fucked up. They were at a party, there was white people there, and they let it slip out. â€œStay wokeâ€ or however the fuck you say it. And some white person heard it, like, â€œAh, what was that?â€ â€œOh, my God.â€ â€œâ€˜Stay wokeâ€™? I wanna say that.â€ â€œI gotta say that around my white friends so they know that Iâ€™m down.â€ â€œOh, my God, Iâ€™m gonna fuckinâ€™ say that.â€ â€œIâ€™m fuckinâ€™ woke. Iâ€™m fuckinâ€™ woke.â€ â€œIâ€™m a woke stickler.â€ â€œIâ€™ve fuckinâ€™ had it, Iâ€™ve had it.â€ â€œI support Black people in my white apartment on Twitter.â€ â€œThatâ€™s what I do. Iâ€™m fuckinâ€™ here for you.â€
Every white person likes to lie to themselves that if they were alive 150 years ago, that they would have been working on the underground railroad, trying to help slaves escape, right? â€œI would be one of the good white people, yes.â€ â€œI would have taken time out of my day, risked my life.â€ And the reality is, is youâ€™d be doing back then exactly what youâ€™re doing todayâ€¦ nothinâ€™. Not a fuckinâ€™ thing. Maybe a little #BlackLivesMatter. â€œOh, my God, my heart breaks on my L-shaped couch.â€ My favorite thing about the Black Lives Matter marches was the store windows that would have the plywood over the windows, and then it would say, â€œBlack lives matterâ€ on top of the plywood. I just loved the duality of that message, you know? Itâ€™s like, â€œBlack lives matter, weâ€™re all the same, weâ€™re all one.â€ â€œDonâ€™t burn down my store, you fuckinâ€™ animals!â€ â€œEverybody is welcome in this store.â€ â€œAnyone can come in.â€ â€œOne at a time, follow him!â€ â€œItâ€™s just a safe space for everyone.â€ Yeah. John Wayne was born in 1907. Thatâ€™s what the fuck heâ€™s gonna sound like. Then you got all these douchebags going like, â€œThatâ€™s not an excuse.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œYes, it is.â€ It absolutely is. You are of your time. Look at these young kids. Remember, for a year and a half, theyâ€™d take a water bottle. Theyâ€™re all standing around and one kid would flip it, and if it landed upright, theyâ€™d goâ€¦ [screaming] â€œOh, shit!â€ And theyâ€™d just lose their fuckinâ€™ minds. I didnâ€™t understand it. But Iâ€™m born in 1968, so Iâ€™m just like, â€œAll right, well, no one tried to slap it out of the way.â€ â€œYou do it enough times, itâ€™s gonna fuckinâ€™ land upright.â€ â€œWhat is happening here?â€ Right? I donâ€™t wanna ruin their good time. Theyâ€™re excited, theyâ€™re gonna get on their scooters and ride off. Like a little posse or some shit. Iâ€™m like, all right, you can do that. Yeah. So that was like a thing for like half a second.
Sean Connery died. The great Sean Connery. Yeah, my favorite James Bond of all time. Yeah. And he was getting a proper send-off for about eight minutes on Twitter, and then the first hairy-leg white chick shows up, right? And sheâ€™s just gotta be like, â€œReally? Really?â€ â€œAre we really gonna celebrate this man who advocated the hitting of women?â€ Itâ€™s like, first of all, he didnâ€™t advocate hitting women, okay? [as Connery] He just, â€œEvery once in a while, you give â€™em a little slap.â€ â€œYeah, give â€™em a little back of the hand, ya remind â€™em whoâ€™s making the bucks off this shit.â€ â€œReset their hard drive.â€ Thatâ€™s all he said, okay? Yes, itâ€™s a crazy statement in 2021. 1976, you know, itâ€™s not good, but itâ€™s not crazy. Right? And heâ€™s born in 1930. You gotta put this shit in historical perspective. I love old movies. You ever watch movies from the â€™30s, â€™40s, and â€™50s? Yeah. Any time a woman even has heightened emotion, thereâ€™s some guy like, â€œGet ahold of yourself!â€ â€œYeah, go make me a pie. Put it on the windowsill.â€ Right? Thatâ€™s what he grew up watchinâ€™. I grew up in the â€™70s. I thought being a truck driver was a cool thing. You know, you had a monkey for a friend. Going around, chicks are showinâ€™ their titties. I thought that that was the world. I had no idea, thatâ€™s what I was watching. My thing is, okay, so if youâ€™re gonna cancel all of these fuckinâ€™ dead guys and shit all over them after theyâ€™re dead and they canâ€™t defend themselves, why are you only going after men? You know, what about all the horrible women in history? You canâ€™t just go after the men, that would be sexist, and this is what they donâ€™t want. You know? I mean, what about Coco Chanel? Great example. Coco Chanel. Widely considered a feminist icon. She started her own purse factory, right, in the 19-teens or â€™20s, whatever the hell she did. I canâ€™t imagine the sexism that she had to deal with, you know. An amazing accomplishment, hats off to her, right? However, she was also a Nazi sympathizer. Yeah. Thatâ€™s like half her fucking Wikipedia page, just sitting there, waiting for someone to read it. Right out in the open, nothinâ€™. So evidently, what happened was, in World War II, old Adolf came rolling into town, okay, with his tanks with the Porsche engines in â€™em, took over the town in like 90 minutes. She freaked out. She closes up her shop, right? Figured out where all the head Nazis were staying, what hotel. She moved in there and she started a relationship with one of the Nazis. Yeah. She started fucking a Nazi. You ever see those Holocaust videos? Huh? With those piles of kidsâ€™ shoes? Yeah. She was sucking the dick that did that. Now, just to refresh my memory, what did Sean Connery do again? â€œOh, you know, every once in a while, you give â€™em a little slap.â€ Thatâ€™s what he did. Sheâ€™s sittinâ€™ there like, â€œHey, Adolf, whatâ€™s goinâ€™ on?â€ She so sold out her own country, she had to flee it at the end of the war, and I have no idea how many dicks she had to suck to get back in it. But despite all of that, I still donâ€™t judge her. I donâ€™t, â€™cause Iâ€™ve never been in that situation. You know, Iâ€™ve never been in a country where all of the sudden, the most powerful army the world has ever seen comes in and takes it over in a couple of hours. She must have been terrified, right? And sheâ€™s a woman. You know? Sheâ€™s into fashion. They show up with those Hugo Boss uniforms. You know, her knees buckle a little bit. Things start getting ugly, people are getting shot in the street. Sheâ€™s freakinâ€™ out. You know. And sheâ€™s a woman, and women know push comes to shove when you get your back against the wall. No matter how bad it gets, they always have the option of fucking their way out of a situation. They always got that card they can play. Right? All women know this. Women, all women know this. Men donâ€™t realize this till they go to prison. But women learn this early on. She had the option and she took it. I canâ€™t get mad at her for that, you know? So sheâ€™s dead and gone. I think sheâ€™s up there in heaven. I think she made it. Sheâ€™s up there with Sean Connery. Every once in a while, they have a disagreement, he gives her a little slap, you know? She doesnâ€™t care. Once you shit on a Naziâ€™s chest, a little backhandâ€™s not gonna freak you out. Jesus canâ€™t say anything, he got a hooker, right? Everybodyâ€™s got a little something they did. Well, there you go, boom. Still buy your Coco Chanel. Sheâ€™s still a hero. She was a victim, she was a victim of that time. She was frightened, she was scared. She didnâ€™t know what to do. Uhâ€¦ anyway. So, weâ€™re living in a fucking weird time. Obviously, beyond all the bullshit thatâ€™s going on now, like, every time I think feminism has kind of like died off, you know, you know, like a band you canâ€™t stand and they havenâ€™t put out an album in a few years, youâ€™re like, â€œOh, good, did they quit, did they break up?â€ All of the sudden, they come out with more shit. Youâ€™re like, â€œFuck, what is it now?â€ Iâ€™m just fucking with you. Feminism doesnâ€™t bug me, you know? It doesnâ€™t bother me. Iâ€™m not afraid of it or anything like that, you know, for the simple fact that I know itâ€™s gonna fail, you know? And I take comfort in that, I do. Iâ€™m not rooting for it becauseâ€¦ I know it doesnâ€™t like me. Umâ€¦ Yeah, do you know why I think itâ€™s not going to survive, why itâ€™s not going to be successful anyway? â€˜Cause they still need menâ€™s help to make it happen. I donâ€™t understand it. I donâ€™t understand why women just canâ€™t work with each other and make this shit happen. They keep coming to us, like, â€œMore men need to care about this issue.â€ â€œWhere are the men to stand up and say somethingâ€¦ yak-yak-yak.â€ Why do I have to fuckinâ€™ say something? This is your fuckinâ€™ problem. Why are you always dragging us into this shit?
I saw a woman a couple months back, professional soccer player, right? She goes onto ESPN on one of these sports channels and she starts bitching, going like, â€œI donâ€™t understand, how come female athletes donâ€™t make as much as male professional athletes?â€ Right? And all of these men had to sit there and act like they didnâ€™t know what the answer was. They had to sit there, like, dumbfounded. Like, â€œOh, I donâ€™t know.â€ â€œWhy is that?â€ â€œThat is a conundrum. I have no idea.â€ Literally, Iâ€™m sitting at home screaming at the TV, â€œâ€˜Cause you donâ€™t sell any fuckinâ€™ tickets!â€ Nobody is going to womenâ€™s soccer games. Youâ€™re playing in a 20,000-seat arena, 1,500 people show up. Thatâ€™s not a good night. The promoter lost his fucking ass on that gig. Iâ€™m not saying no professional female athletesâ€¦ Serena Williams, the women in the UFC, you know? But nobodyâ€™s watching your fuckinâ€™ sport. And then youâ€™re gonna come and youâ€™re gonna get mad at fuckinâ€™ men. They keep doing that shit. Why are you yelling at us? Itâ€™s not our fucking job. Itâ€™s not my fuckinâ€™ job to give a fuck about womenâ€™s soccer, okay? I have menâ€™s sport to pay attention to. This isâ€¦ itâ€™s your bullshit, right?
Dude, look at the WNBA. Dude, nobody in the WNBA got COVID. Nobody. They have been playing in front of 300 to 400 people a night for a quarter of a century. Not to mention itâ€™s a male-subsidized league. We gave ya a fuckinâ€™ league. None of ya showed up. Where are all the feminists? That place should be packed with feminists. Faces painted, wearing jerseys, flashinâ€™ their titties. Goinâ€™ fuckinâ€™ nuts, like the guys do in the upper deck with their big beer titties. â€œAm I on the jumbotron? Am I doing it?â€ Yeah. You didnâ€™t. None of you, none of you went to the fuckinâ€™ games. None of you. You all, you failed them, not me. Not men. Women failed the WNBA. Ladies, ladies, name your top five all-time WNBA players of all time. Come on. Letâ€™s hear it. Name five WNBA teams. Name the WNBA team in your fuckinâ€™ city. You canâ€™t do it! You donâ€™t give a fuck about them. They play night in and night out in front of nobody. Itâ€™s a fuckinâ€™ tragedy, right?
And then meanwhile, you look at the Kardashians, theyâ€™re making billions. You look at those Real Housewives shows, theyâ€™re making money hand over fist â€™cause thatâ€™s what women are watchinâ€™. The money listens. You donâ€™t wanna watch this shit, youâ€™re watching this shit. They just shoot it over there, drowning these whores in money and purses and shoes and Botox. Itâ€™s just raining. Itâ€™s raining money. Yeah. So, the money listens. Youâ€™d rather watch that shit, Real Housewives, a bunch of women just tearing each other down. â€œWell, maybe thatâ€™s why your husband left you.â€ â€œMaybe thatâ€™s why your husband left. Thatâ€™s why you canâ€™t have kids, bitch!â€ â€œThatâ€™s why your ass is as flat as your titties, bitch.â€ Right? Thatâ€™s the message you sent. â€œWe would rather watch that than see a bunch of women come together as a team and try to achieve a common goal.â€ â€œWe would rather watch them actually fucking destroy each other.â€
Yeah. No, no, no. And then in the end, you come back and you fuckinâ€™ yell at guys. And itâ€™s like, let me get this straight, I have to buy you a drink, stop the axe murderer from coming through the fuckinâ€™ window, and I have to watch WNBA games for you? Like, when are you gonna pick up your end of the couch?
Yeah. I donâ€™t have any sympathy for women when it comes to shit like that because every study theyâ€™ve ever done to determine whoâ€™s smarter, men or women, every study comes back and says women are smarter. Every fuckinâ€™ one.
Ladies, you shouldnâ€™t be applauding that. You know Iâ€™m an asshole. You know this isnâ€™t gonna end well. â€œDid he say Iâ€™m pretty?â€ â€œOh, my God.â€ Get out of the relationship. If every study says that youâ€™re smarter, okay, the question you should be asking yourself, if weâ€™re so goddamn smart, how are we in the situation weâ€™re in? Well? Youâ€™re in the situation youâ€™re in not because of guys like me. As much as you want to blame me, you know? Ladies, you never drove by a sports bar on a football Sunday and looked at the humanity in there? All those dumb guys with their big beer bellies bumpinâ€™ shit. â€œHey, heâ€™s on my fantasy team!â€ â€œUp top, yeah!â€ â€œYou wanna get some more mozzarella sticks?â€
As a woman with your bigger brain, you never looked in there and thought to yourself, â€œIâ€™m fuckinâ€™ losinâ€™ to that?â€ â€œIâ€™m losinâ€™ to that?â€ Yeah, thereâ€™s nothing stopping you. Other than the fact that you guys are just into destroying each other. Oh, now itâ€™s gonna get quiet? I see all that sneaky shit you do. Ladies, if you could just support the WNBA the way you support a fat chick thatâ€™s proud of her body and is no longer a threat to you, you know? That league would be doing better numbers than the NBA. Oh, my God, thatâ€™s one of the saddest things Iâ€™ve ever seen. â€œOh, my God, youâ€™re a goddess, youâ€™re gorgeous.â€ â€œYou look great in that bikini.â€ â€œI would kill myself if I looked like that.â€ â€œKeep eating, keep eating.â€ â€œLose a toe, you fat bitch.â€
Itâ€™s justâ€¦ You saw an alcoholic, would you be like, â€œOh, my God, look at you.â€ â€œYouâ€™re facedown, passed out, your kids are crying.â€ â€œYouâ€™re a hero, youâ€™re a god.â€ â€œKeep doing what youâ€™re doing.â€ Youâ€™d be like, â€œDude, get your fuckinâ€™ shit together.â€ â€œGet off the sauce.â€
I will say thatâ€™s one of the most genius things Iâ€™ve ever seen, how regular-looking women somehow mind-fucked advertising to get beautiful women off of billboards. Yeah. Just regular fuckinâ€™ who-gives-a-shit-lookinâ€™ women, right? Iâ€™m just being honest. Come on, weâ€™re outside, weâ€™re in the woods, we can be honest. Just regular who-gives-a-fuckâ€¦ canâ€™t-remember-her-name-looking women. Right? Lookinâ€™ at these goddesses and they had to fuckinâ€™ beâ€¦ â€œHow am I supposed to compete with that?â€ You canâ€™t! How fucking arrogant are you? I donâ€™t see Brad Pitt when he takes his shirt off in a movie and, â€œOh, great, how am I supposed to compete with that?â€ I canâ€™t. I am an ugly, bald, orange man. I need to write jokes. I gotta put a lampshade on my head. I know what my role is, okay? I should be on the ground gazing up at people better-looking than me. I donâ€™t know, ladies, this is supposed to be like an inspirational talk. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s coming through this way. Iâ€™m trying to say, if you really likeâ€¦ If you get through all the misdirected anger of my childhoodâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to say, youâ€™re smarter than we are and thereâ€™s more of you. I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know what to tell you. Iâ€™m trying to beâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. Trying to be a better person during all of this shit, you know? I am. You know, I got this new thing, man. I try to help out homeless people. You know? Sometimes I help them out, sometimes I donâ€™t. You know, itâ€™s like the mood youâ€™re in, how much they freak you out. You know? So, this is what I do. You got to do something because people at the top donâ€™t seem to be doing anything. I try to bring all my old clothes down to the tent cities to give it to them. Itâ€™s a good thing to do, but I gotta tell you something, you gotta do it during the day. All right? You want to do it during the day when theyâ€™re tired from Thunderdome the night before, theyâ€™re coming down from whatever theyâ€™re on, realizing thereâ€™s a nail in their shoulder. You want to get them when theyâ€™re tired. You donâ€™t go at night. No oneâ€™s gonna see you again, youâ€™re gonna end up on a fuckinâ€™ spit. I mean, youâ€™re under an overpass, you never know what can happen, okay? Iâ€™m just warning you â€™cause they donâ€™t make homeless people the way they made them when I was a kid, you know? When I was a kid, a homeless guy was a bum, he was a vagrant, somebody down on his luck or whatever. You know, a wino. They didnâ€™t have this Shutter Island shit going on that they had out there, like people talking to trees. [shouting gibberish] Youâ€™re right here having, like, eggs Benedict. Heâ€™s, like, looking through a porthole over your cabbage. Yeah. When I was a kid, you could only be crazy outside for about 15 minutes before a van would pull up and two guys in nursesâ€™ outfits would just come walking out. â€œHey, buddy, howâ€™s it going?â€ â€œYouâ€™re making a lot of racket out here, arenâ€™t ya?â€ â€œWhy donâ€™t you do me a favor, try this shirt on?â€ Be like, â€œOkay. How come the sleeves are so long?â€ â€œOh, because weâ€™re gonna tie your arms behind your back â€™cause youâ€™re out of your fucking mind, thatâ€™s it.â€ â€œNot gonna have you out here scaring the shit out of people.â€ â€œGet in the fuckinâ€™ van!â€ And he got in the van and that was it. They send you to a nuthouse. Thatâ€™s it, boom, bam, done, nuthouse. But the problem was the people at the nuthouses started fucking the patients â€™cause everybody knows crazy people are great in bed, right? So theyâ€™re banging away, right? Hey, it happened. Youâ€™re groaning at history, all right? You can shake your heads all you want, butâ€¦ Hey, hey! They fucked those people, all right? And they were banging away, doctors with their fuckinâ€™ lab coats flappinâ€™ in the wind, just banging away, until finallyâ€¦ for decadesâ€¦ finally somebody with a heart came walking in, â€œHey, what the fuck is going on here?â€ And then they shut it down and then they just let all these people go. They all came running out like Mike Myers, jumping up on station wagons and shit. So thatâ€™s the thing, you go during the day. And I gotta tell you, when I pull up to one of these tent cities, I always feel good about myself. â€œThis is good, man, helping out a fellow American.â€ â€œI would want them to do that for me.â€ â€œItâ€™s fuckinâ€™ ridiculous people have to live like that.â€ Thatâ€™s what I think when Iâ€™m in the car, and then the second I get out and that smell hits me, Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuck am I doing? Jesus Christ, these people are animals!â€ Right? I would equate it to the same feeling you probably get if you were on a safari and youâ€™re in the Land Rover, and you look over and you see, like, a leopard. Youâ€™re like, â€œLook at that leopard over there.â€ Right? Then all of the sudden you go over a bump and fall out of the fuckinâ€™ Range Rover. â€œOh, fuck, thatâ€™s a leopard!â€ Yeah, so I pull up and Iâ€™m feeling like fuckinâ€™ Uncle Sam. Then I get out of the car and Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuck am I doing?â€ I start walking like this. Thereâ€™s always some sort of movement going on, somebody fuckinâ€™ limping across the street or something. And Iâ€™ve never been able to get close enough to talk, really, to anybody. You know, like they do on the news. You know, like, â€œJeez, have you been sitting in here, you know, for a couple of months?â€ â€œWhat is it like to be inside of this tent?â€ I always wondered how many people they had to choke out before they could get that fuckinâ€™ interview. You know, just cominâ€™ inâ€¦ blow darts. Numbinâ€™ up everybody else. Building a perimeter. So, what Iâ€¦ What I do is I get about 30 yards away, and then I just start walking like this. And then I chicken out, I always chicken out. Thirty yards away, I just go, â€œFree shirts!â€ I run back to the car. And thatâ€™s when your brain starts playing tricks on you. Like Iâ€™m convinced somebody just came running out of the tent with a 2-by-4. Running after me. So I always do a lap around my car before I get in it, you know. â€˜Cause homeless people have horrible lateral movement. You know, from all those years of sleeping on the sidewalk, their hips are just junk, you know, like an NFL running back. They slow down like a cruise ship, go right up and over the horizon. So in that time, you go around, you get in your car, you drive away. You drive away. Your closetâ€™s a little more empty. You can go out, you can fill it back up again with shit you donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ need, you know, thatâ€™s what you do.
[man] America!
Whatâ€™s that, sir?
[man] America!
America, yeah! America! Donâ€™t think. Just do what you wanna do. Take your dick out, you know? Iâ€™ll tell ya, thatâ€™s what George Washington was talking about. You know? They really need to shut down the Internet. We are clearly too stupid to all be sharing ideas in this giant townie bar that weâ€™ve created. You guys are all cheering, youâ€™re all on the Internet just like me. I was on the Internet for six hours last night. Trying to figure out what kills a beaver, you know? Does a beaver have a natural predator? No. You wouldnâ€™t know it from all the ignorant shit Iâ€™ve said so far, but I am a changed person, believe it or not. I am. I had an experience earlier this year.
[man] Bullshit.
This is all true. You donâ€™t think so? Guy just yelled â€œbullshit.â€ Are you saying â€œbullshit,â€ sir, â€™cause you donâ€™t believe me or â€™cause you donâ€™t want me to leave? Is that what it is? The little angry circle that youâ€™re in? Donâ€™t be goinâ€™ and gettinâ€™ happy now. Donâ€™t be goinâ€™ and gettinâ€™ soft on me. Donâ€™t start hugginâ€™ people and lovinâ€™ yourself. And cryinâ€™ when you see somethinâ€™ cute. Hang onto it! Lash out at people. Reach for your pistol under the seat. Do it!
[man] Yeah!
No, I took mushrooms back in February for the first time ever.
[audience cheering, whistling]
This is the perfect state to tell this story. You guys should literally haveâ€¦ you should have mushrooms on your fuckinâ€™ license plate. All right, so hereâ€™s the deal. I never fucked with anything like that. I was always a booze guy. Always a booze guy, you know. Yeah, you know. Relax, everybody. I always get nervous when I get white guys going like, â€œYeah! All right, whoo!â€ â€œAll right!â€ â€œBuild the wall! Yeah!â€ Iâ€™m fuckinâ€™ around, relax. Itâ€™s frightening to listen to, but thatâ€™s what being a guy is. Youâ€™re not allowed to have emotions. So all that shit comes out when youâ€™re drinking. [growling] â€œDo something dumb so I donâ€™t feel stupid!â€
Soâ€¦ yeah, I was always like a booze guy, so I never fucked with psychedelics or whatever, so it was one of these deals. I was out in the desert, man, and I was like, all right, I got somebody watching my kids. Everythingâ€™s fine, Iâ€™m in my fifties. I gotta do it now or Iâ€™m never gonna do it, right? So this person, who may or may not have been my opening act tonight, goes, â€œAll right, man.â€ Uhâ€¦ Heâ€™s a good man, heâ€™s a good man. He says to me, he goes, â€œAll right.â€ He goes, â€œOkay, just take like, you knowâ€¦â€ You know, itâ€™s always just like, â€œAll right, so, like, how fucked up do you wanna get, all right?â€ And thereâ€™s always like a square and itâ€™s like, â€œOkay, donâ€™t eat the whole square.â€ â€œJust like, bite one corner, lick the other one, and then rub the other one.â€ â€œLet it absorb in your face or whatever.â€ So, Iâ€™m like, â€œAll right.â€ He goes, â€œHow far into it do you wanna go?â€ I go, â€œI just wanna trip a little bit, nothing crazy.â€ So he goes, â€œFine,â€ so I ate just a little bit. I get a little nauseous or whatever. At first it feels like I ate some weed, but then all of the sudden I notice shit thatâ€™s not alive looks like itâ€™s breathing, right? Like the refrigerator looked like it just did a lap around the house. Itâ€™s kind ofâ€¦ Nothinâ€™ threatening, you know. It needed it, you know. TV started getting bigger. Itâ€™s looking like itâ€™s gonna fall on me. All right, and I was doing fine. I was like, â€œI know that TVâ€™s not getting bigger.â€ â€œAnd if it is, I donâ€™t give a shit, go ahead.â€ â€œSpill that pixelation all over me, I donâ€™t give a fuck.â€ â€œI know Iâ€™m trippinâ€™, Iâ€™m having fun. Iâ€™m giggling.â€
Iâ€™m laughing and shit, Iâ€™m putting things together, and everything is fuckinâ€™ great. And all of the sudden, about an hour inâ€¦ all of a sudden this profound sense of loneliness and not feeling loved just washed over me. Yeah, and I was just like, â€œI fuckinâ€™ knew it.â€ I fuckinâ€™ knew it. This is why I didnâ€™t do it. I knew I had too many demons. I knew I wasnâ€™t going to see God and fuckinâ€™ unicorns and slide down the rainbow and roll around in the grass. I fuckinâ€™ knew Satan was coming up. There was gonna be a guy with a knife and shit. I was just like, â€œAll right, go ahead. Drag me into the abyss.â€ â€œLet me see how fucked up I am,â€ and this feeling, it just enveloped me, and I donâ€™t even know how to describe it, it wasnâ€™t even a feeling. It just was, it just was.
So Iâ€™m freakinâ€™ the fuck out. Iâ€™m sitting there like, â€œWhat the fuck?â€ I canâ€™t get out of it, dude. Like I could walk a hundred fuckinâ€™ million miles, I canâ€™t walk out of it, it just was. So everybody else is, like, trippinâ€™, I didnâ€™t want to fuckinâ€™ ruin their trip, so Iâ€™m just like, â€œAll right, dude, Iâ€™m just gonna go to the bedroom.â€ â€œOh, look at the refrigerator. Refrigeratorâ€¦â€ [laughing nervously] All right. â€œIâ€™m just feelinâ€™ a little nauseous.â€ Just playinâ€™ it up, right? Goinâ€™ in the fuckinâ€™ bedroom, and Iâ€™m just layinâ€™ down in the bedroom like, â€œDude, what the fuck? What the fuck?â€ And every time I thought I felt the bottom, it would justâ€¦ just further into the bed, further into the bed, further into the bed. So about a half hour later, my wife comes in. Sheâ€™s like, â€œHey, how you doing?â€ Typical guy. â€œGreat, Iâ€™m doinâ€™ great.â€ â€œIâ€™m doinâ€™ great.â€ â€œItâ€™s goinâ€™ great.â€ So sheâ€™s laying next to me, â€œIâ€™m feeling a little nauseous, this is a little bit much for me.â€ And sheâ€™s just laying down and Iâ€™m just feeling this feeling. Not feeling loved, profound sense of loneliness. So now Iâ€™m just looking at my wife, and my brain just starts going like, â€œOh, fuck, did I marry the wrong person?â€ â€œWhy am I lookinâ€™ atâ€¦â€ I know it seems fucked up, but once youâ€™re married long enough, even not on mushrooms, you have that thought every fuckinâ€™ six weeks. You just do. Something happens where you just look at the side of their head and just do the math and just think, â€œWhy did I ever talk to you?â€ â€œI could have just walked by. I didnâ€™t even have to say hello.â€ â€œWe had no relationship.â€ â€œWe were nothing!â€ â€œWhat would happen if I just never talked to you?â€ Every six weeks, you think thatâ€™s a healthy relationship? That means youâ€™ve still held on to a part of yourself that even though you love this person, you still, you know, you still want to run around like a mustang a little bit, right? So anyways, Iâ€™m like, that was freaking me out even more to think of my wife and be feeling that. So I was like, â€œFuck, I need to pull the rip cord.â€ â€œI gotta get out of this fuckinâ€™â€¦ itâ€™s like a giant beanbag.â€ Couldnâ€™t get out of it, right? So I was like, â€œOh, fuck.â€ Think about your kids. Now, I love my kids. And I know they love me, there is no fuckinâ€™ question. And I start thinking about my kids. And I still felt that feeling. And I was like, â€œAll right, what the fuck is this?â€ â€˜Cause I know thatâ€™s bullshit. And I just sort of laid there. And I relaxed. And I went, â€œOh, fuck, I know what this is.â€ This is how I felt growing up. [chuckles] Yeah. This is what the â€™70s and â€™80s were like. Both your parents worked. You got a set of keys to the house when you were three. â€œOh, yeah, son. Get the fuck out of my face, son.â€ It was fuckinâ€™ nuts, yeah. I grew up in a very, like, angry time, you know? Like, you were afraid of your dad, your dadâ€™s dad. I talked about this shit before, but Iâ€™m still working through it, so just bear with me. You just were fuckinâ€™â€¦ Yeah, like I love seeing kids nowadays loving their dad. Like, â€œDad, wanna go play, Dad? Letâ€™s go ride bikes! Dad!â€ Yeah, when I was a kid, it was like, â€œDad, fuck, Dad!â€ â€œFuck!â€ â€œRun! Open a window.â€ â€œMom, what did you see in that?â€ â€“ Fucking lunatic, right?
[man] Yeah!
It was absolute fuckinâ€™ lunacy. And not just my house. I love my parents, but it was just the time. Everybody was fuckinâ€™ crazy, you were afraid, and people could put their hands on you and other peopleâ€™s dads could hit you, and then you come home, â€œWhat the fuck did you do?â€ â€œIâ€™ll fuckinâ€™ hit you for it!â€ It was just nuts. Teachers would grab you, dig their nails into your fuckinâ€™ neck. Sheâ€™d come home, â€œShe wouldnâ€™t have done that unless something happened.â€ Right? It was all of that shit. Me and my siblings, we all beat the shit out of each other. You know. And then we all teased the dog, and the dog bit all of us. And we never got rid of the dog. One time the dog bit me in the face. I was fuckinâ€™ with it, it was eating, I was likeâ€¦ And he latched onto my face likeâ€¦ Like that. My dad had to stitch me up and everything. We still didnâ€™t get rid of the dog, you know? â€œAw, heâ€™s a good dog, he had a moment.â€ â€œJesus Christ, you shouldnâ€™t have put your goddamn face down there near the fuckinâ€™ dog.â€ Yeah. So thatâ€™s all it was. It was weird, we were like The Brady Bunch meets Lord of the Flies. Like, on paper, it was great. It was a station wagon full of fuckinâ€™, you knowâ€¦ Norman Rockwell, we went to church, we got Dunkinâ€™ Donuts. Yeah, that was about the fuckâ€¦ soâ€¦ I donâ€™t know, so anyway, we all ended upâ€¦ My dad was one of those people, he said whatever the fuck was on his mind. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know, like that haircut women get when they get to a certain age? They got a couple of kids, they just get it cut a little shorter â€™cause they donâ€™t wanna deal with it. They put that little Hillary Clinton flip in it or something. Right? They get it all shaved up the fuckinâ€™ back. First time you bend â€™em over, you feel like youâ€™re fuckinâ€™ your friend Eric. Right? You know? But you love your wife, so you lie and you tell them, â€œOh, looks good.â€ â€œLooks great, I always wanted to fuck Geraldine Ferraro.â€ â€œMy God, itâ€™s amazing.â€ My dad didnâ€™t care. We picked my mother up, she got in the car, he just goes, â€œAw, Christ, it looks like shit!â€ â€œJesus Christ, what the fuck did they do to you?â€ â€œAw, for Christâ€™s sake, you look like a fuckinâ€™ man.â€ My momâ€™s just sittinâ€™ there likeâ€¦ Weâ€™re in the back seat like, â€œThis is what a functional relationship looks like.â€ Whoo! Yeah. So, because of all that, we all ended up getting, like, physical ailments from being in the fight-or-flight mode our whole lives. Everything, gym teachers were scary, collecting on your paperâ€¦ Everybody was scary fuckinâ€™ everything. One time my dad told a priest he didnâ€™t deserve to wear the collar. I donâ€™t know how it happened. We were discussing the altar boysâ€™ scheduleâ€¦ and, I donâ€™t know, he wanted to put me on a different mass, and my dad started getting his leg going. â€œYou donâ€™t deserve to wear the fucking collar!â€ The guyâ€™s jaw was on the ground, and then the best part, next week we go to mass. They havenâ€™t spoken in a week, and my dad comes walkinâ€™ like, â€œHey, how you doinâ€™, whatâ€™s going on?â€ Like nothing happened. Yeah, so anyway, we all end up getting these physical ailments. Like one of my siblings has stomach problems, another one has this pain that wonâ€™t go away in his back. I remember I had, like, alopecia in, like, the third grade. Third grade, I literally had clumps of hair falling out like I was working on Wall Street, you know. And I was just sitting there like, â€œDid I pick up all the toys?â€ â€œDid I do the dishes?â€ â€œHeâ€™s gonna find something, he always finds something.â€ â€œFuck, what do I do? I gotta kill him.â€ â€œI should kill him, thatâ€™s what I should do.â€ â€œWhen heâ€™s sleeping, Iâ€™ll take an extension cord.â€ â€œIâ€™ll wrap it around, put my fuckinâ€™ foot on his back.â€ â€œBilly seems to lack the focus in class that he needs.â€ â€œHeâ€™s not working up to his ability.â€ Right?
Yeah, so, anyway, I took these fuckinâ€™ mushrooms. All right? And I realized that I have been carrying that shit around and being like, all right, well, thatâ€™s why I drank the way I did. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve trashed women the way Iâ€¦ All the fuckinâ€™ shit. I knew every fuckinâ€™ thing I did, good and bad, in that moment. I was like, all right, now I got to get sober and I got to fuckinâ€™ work my way through this shit, because, you know, my wifeâ€¦
I donâ€™t know if you guys noticed, I have a bit of a temper. [chuckles] â€œNo, not you, Bill.â€ Yeah. So hereâ€™s the thing, you know, Iâ€™m so fucked up and grew up in such a fucked-up time that I didnâ€™t even think I had a temper â€™cause I was like, â€œI donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ yell at people in my house.â€ I curse my wife out, I mean we get into it. I get into it with her, but I donâ€™t go like, â€œJesus Christ, you fuckinâ€™ bitch,â€ I donâ€™t do that stuff. I donâ€™t yell at my kids, but what I do isâ€¦ what I still do is I flip out. So, like I said, I didnâ€™t think that this was a problem. My wife told me it was a problem, but I donâ€™t listen to her, you know. Why would I listen to her? All she does is criticize, you know? I got nothing but bad reviews on the fuckinâ€™ Husband Yelp. Itâ€™s just all, â€œYou know, didnâ€™t enjoy the experience.â€ â€œThumbs down, half a star,â€ never get a fuckinâ€™ â€œattaboy,â€ right? So it just becomes white noise after a while. â€œWhat, am I doing something wrong again? Oh, yeah, you again, okay, great.â€ â€œGreat, what did I do this time, huh?â€ â€œWhat do I have to work on?â€ â€œGo ahead, fuckinâ€™ let me know,â€ right? So, I donâ€™t listen to my lovely wife. Like an idiotâ€¦ Like the idiot that I am, soâ€¦
One day I learned a harsh lesson, okay? It was a breakfast time. For some reason I had, like, 20 minutes to myself, which is really rare when you got two kids four and under, right? So Iâ€™m thinking like, â€œHoly shit, I can actually make myself a breakfast, like the old days.â€ â€œIâ€™ll make two eggs over easy, Iâ€™ll make some toast, Iâ€™ll make some bacon, fuckinâ€™ burn it up the way I like it.â€ â€œItâ€™s gonna be the shit, right?â€
So Iâ€™m having a great time, making myself a Grand Slam breakfast. I sit down to eat, I got the OJ, I got the glass of water. It looks like a picture from a commercial. And right as I sit down to eat, my phone lights up and I get a text message from my buddy. He goes, â€œHey, man, I thought you were coming on this Zoom meeting.â€ â€œIt started five minutes ago, we need you on this.â€ And I just absolutely lost it. I was like, Jesus Christ, of course I have a meeting. Of course I have my meeting, because why couldnâ€™t I just have one goddamn cocksucking motherfucking moment to myself?! Fuckinâ€™ toast flying all over the place. Flippinâ€™ the fuck up.
And then all of the sudden, my daughter, who was like two and a half at the time, comes running into the kitchen with big tears in her eyes, just going, â€œI sorry, I sorry, Dada. Dada, I sorry.â€ And I was like, â€œOh, shit!â€ So I literally just squatted down, I was like, â€œNo, buddy, come here.â€ â€œI wasnâ€™t yelling at you. Daddy would never yell at you.â€ â€œI love you, buddy. Daddy was yelling at the phone, okay?â€ â€œDad yells at the phone when it says stuff that he doesnâ€™t like, okay?â€ â€œYour dad has issues. Iâ€™m sorry, buddy. I would never yell at you.â€ And I could literally feel her tears drying in my shirt. I was like, â€œBuddy, I would never do that, okay?â€ â€œI love you. You still love me?â€ She said, â€œYeah.â€ I go, â€œOkay, all right, buddy.â€
And then you know when you do that thing with a kid where you turn them around and push them in the direction you want them to go in? And I just had to sit there like, I just did that to a two-and-a-half-year-old, and she was like walking away, and Iâ€™m just sitting there thinking like, â€œHow bad was that?â€ â€œIs she just gonna go play with a toy and forget about it, or is she no longer gonna be an astronaut?â€ Like, what did I just do? I thought I was better than my dad, Iâ€™m making the same mistakes that heâ€™s making. I fuckinâ€™ hate myself.
I didnâ€™t do the meeting, I didnâ€™t eat the breakfast. I just went upstairs, just wanted to be alone, right? Just want to be fuckinâ€™ alone, but I got a wife, so it doesnâ€™t work that way. You know? Especially when you fuck up as bad as I did and as loudly as I did. I knew she was cominâ€™ down the hall. I knew I was going to have to watch some game film. She was bringing the projector, the screen was gonna come down, and Iâ€™m literally just laying in there, like, â€œPlease, God, just let her give me two minutes to fuckinâ€™ calm down.â€
Nope, she just comes right in and sheâ€™s just like, â€œSoâ€¦ you wanna discuss that little incident that happened downstairs in the kitchen?â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, honey, can you just give me a second?â€ â€œMy heart is still on the floor. Give me a second. I know I fucked up.â€ She doesnâ€™t give a shit at that point, and sheâ€™s right, itâ€™s her kid too, so she just launched in, â€œIf you think you can do this in this fuckinâ€™ houseâ€¦â€ All this shit, andâ€¦ I mean, she was 100% right, but I wasnâ€™t ready to hear the information. So she just sort of zoned out. â€œTheyâ€™re my kids too andâ€¦â€
And Iâ€™m just sittinâ€™ thereâ€¦ laying in the bed with the nerve to be upset with her. She didnâ€™t do anything, and Iâ€™m just staring at her mouth as itâ€™s moving, not hearing anything. I just started thinking of the news, a news story popped into my head. You know that news story, youâ€™ll see it every year, year and a half. Youâ€™ll see some guy, never committed a crime in his life, you know, went to church every week. Helped old ladies across the street. And then out of nowhere, he just kills his wife. Itâ€™s gotta be from times like this. It just has to be. He just had something to say. Like, I donâ€™t know, I just fucked up, butâ€¦ I knew she was right, so I sat there, I fuckinâ€™ took it, you know? I will say, as an aside, the next time you see a guy who never even cheated on his taxes, and then out of nowhere he kills his wife, I think itâ€™s high time to bring back the question, â€œWhat did she say?â€ Okay? Iâ€™m just sayinâ€™, all right? Examine the problem from 360 degrees.
So anyway, so, I love my dad and everything, you know, but thereâ€™s things I want to improve on, so the great thing I have done is my kids are not afraid of me. And every time I have fucked up, Iâ€™ve gotten down on my kidsâ€™ level and let them know that I was wrong and I apologize. So, the great thing is my kids are not afraid of me. So now, my daughterâ€™s a little bit older, sheâ€™s like four and a half now, so now whenever I start flipping out, she actually has been helping me to stop. â€˜Cause the second I hear that cute voice, I canâ€™tâ€¦ I just think, â€œDada, I sorry,â€ I just immediatelyâ€¦
Itâ€™s hilarious, Iâ€™ll be in the kitchen. Iâ€™m always in the kitchen doing something, right? And one day I just come in like, â€œWhat the fuck kind of toaster is this?â€ â€œWhat was wrong with the other toaster?â€ â€œI need to download the app to make fucking cocksuckingâ€¦â€ And all of the sudden, sheâ€™ll just be like, in the other room, be like, â€œDad, donâ€™t scream like that!â€ The second I hear that voice, Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re right, buddy, sorry.â€ â€œSorry, Iâ€™m just gonna download the app here.â€ â€œDownload the app in the amount of time it would take to make some fuckinâ€™ toast!â€ Umâ€¦ â€œOoh, Dad, you said a bad word. You said a bad word.â€
She does all of that shit, right? To the point, one nightâ€¦ We have movie night once a week. Itâ€™s my favorite thing, weâ€™ll watch some Pixar thing, you know. One of those great movies, you know. Theyâ€™re great. Theyâ€™re for kids and adults. Itâ€™s fuckinâ€™ awesome. We sit down, make the popcorn and everything. So we have this smart TV in the living room. Oh, people, this is a smart TV. Oh, is it smart. Oh, is this fuckinâ€™ TV. Itâ€™s so goddamn smart that one time I was in there, I had all the lights up because we were gonna watch a movie, but the TVâ€™s so smart, as Iâ€™m pressing â€œonâ€â€¦ which you donâ€™t even do. Donâ€™t hit the â€œonâ€ button. You hit the â€œonâ€ button, that fucks it up, you gotta press two other buttons. â€œOh, is that what I gotta do? Is that what I have to fuckinâ€™ do?â€ â€œDonâ€™t scream like that.â€ â€œYouâ€™re right, buddy.â€ This fuckinâ€™ thing, if the lights are out, will not turn on, â€™cause itâ€™s thinking, â€œWell, the lights are out, obviously nobody is in the room.â€ Well, maybe somebodyâ€™s asleep on the couch and they rolled over onto the remote. Meanwhile Iâ€™m standing in the dark, â€œYouâ€™re gonna turn on â€™cause I fuckinâ€™ bought you and I fuckinâ€™ said so,â€ right? So my kid comes running. Sheâ€™s like, â€œDada, donâ€™t scream like that.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re right, buddy. Iâ€™m sorry.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œDada, why do you scream like that?â€ â€œâ€˜Cause I paid all this money for this TV.â€ â€œI wanna sit down and watch the movie with you, and every time I go to turn it on, it wonâ€™t turn on.â€ â€œItâ€™s always something.â€
So she put her little hand on my shoulder, she goes, â€œDada, itâ€™s gonna be okay. Itâ€™s gonna be okay.â€ Right? I donâ€™t even think she knows what that means. I just think she knows when to say it, because my wife always says that. â€œHoney, itâ€™s gonna be okay, just relax. Weâ€™ll get you another balloon.â€ â€œWe can get you another one.â€ So thatâ€™s what she did. She was just going, â€œDada, itâ€™s gonna be okay.â€ Right? She had that little cute hand on my shoulder. And I donâ€™t know, it just hit me, I was just thinking like, yeah. Youâ€™re right, it is going to be okay, right? â€œI mean, I could turn the lights on.â€ â€œI can relax. I donâ€™t even need to watch it.â€ â€œAs long as Iâ€™m hanging out with you, this is great.â€
It was like a profound moment for me for like half a second. Then another moment, then I felt like a loser â€™cause Iâ€™m like, how fucked up am I that a four-and-a-half-year-old is, like, my life coach, like, dropping these truth bombs on me?
Soâ€¦ anyway. So Iâ€™m going to try to stay sober until I figure outâ€¦ Yeah, dude, it fuckinâ€™ sucks, though, Iâ€™m not gonna lie to you. Just every day, takinâ€™ life in the face. Praying for sleep. Oh, God, make it end. Fuckinâ€™ hate these happy sober people. â€œItâ€™s amazing, I feel so alive. I have all this fuckinâ€™ energy.â€ How long does that take, you know? I drink a milk shake once a week, thatâ€™s my big fucking thing. Have a root beer float, oh, itâ€™s just sad. Itâ€™s just a sad thing, like watching an old athlete that canâ€™t run anymore. â€œI used to day drink, man, it was great.â€ Soâ€¦
Anyway, umâ€¦ By the way, I havenâ€™t even mentioned how blown away I am that Iâ€™m playing in this place. This is absolutely great.
[audience cheering]
Yeah. Itâ€™s hilarious. You stay up here for like an hour with this wind, your fuckinâ€™ lips get all chapped. Itâ€™s like youâ€™re standing on the front of a boat. So, anyway, letâ€™s end with a couple of silly ones here. Weâ€™ll be on our way, right? Letâ€™s see what I did. All right, Iâ€™m doing good here. All right, so, hereâ€™s a good one for you.
A couple of years ago, before all this stupid fuckinâ€™ pandemic shit started, Mother Natureâ€™s half-assed attempt to get rid of the amount of people she needs to get rid of, you know, just procrastinating, treating it like a term paper. Umâ€¦ I was in New York, I had an acting gig. I was playing a fireman. All right, now, Iâ€™m not the best actor, right? Some of you saw it. I hope you paid for it, you cheap bastards. You all watched it for free, you bastards. So, anyways, Iâ€™m not the best actor, so I have to look the part, so I grew this giant fireman mustache, big stupid fireman mustache, which looked great when I was wearing the whole fireman getup, and they put the fake dirt on my face. I looked like Iâ€™d been fighting fires for 20 years, right? However, the second I took off the costume and they cleaned off my face and I put on my regular clothes, I immediately just looked like some sad old queen that never found love, right?
And as luck would have it, I was in New York City in June, which I quickly found out was Gay Pride Month. The whole month. And let me tell you something, the gay guys show up strong. It is wall-to-wall, the fuckinâ€™ island is almost tipping over, thereâ€™s so many of them. And Iâ€™m sitting there going, â€œOh, my God.â€ Thirty days of this shit. Iâ€™m walking around with this orange Freddie Mercury fuckinâ€™ dick broom on my face. I am gonna be getting harassed up and down the street. I was in actor shape, man, I was fuckinâ€™ shredded.
I gotta tell you something, man, when I tell you 30 days of June, not one gay guy even fuckinâ€™ looked at me. Forget about even hit on me. I have never felt so old and undesirable in my life. Dude, Iâ€™m gonna tell you something, thereâ€™s one thing as a man when you get so old that women donâ€™t look at you anymore. Like, you know youâ€™re gonna hit that age, you know that dayâ€™s coming, but nobody tells you, at some point, youâ€™re gonna get so old, not even a man wants to fuck you, right? Dude, that is a statement. When you get so old, some queen in his sixties is, â€œKeep it movinâ€™, I can do better than that.â€ â€œJesus Christ.â€ â€œGet some fuckinâ€™ hair plugs or something. Get a spray tan.â€ â€œI can get someone in his forties. Come on, keep going.â€
Dude, I was having this fuckinâ€™ panic attack. I was thinking like, â€œOh, my God, I waited too long to get married.â€ â€œI had kids too late, Iâ€™m gonna die soon.â€ I was literally wrapping up my life, you know? So Iâ€™m walking down like Ninth Avenue, putting a little swish in my fuckinâ€™ step, just tryinâ€™ to get something. I was desperate. Fuck you, ladies, youâ€™ve been there. You know how it is. You wanna think you got one more in ya, you know? So Iâ€™m tra-la-la-ing down the street. I really wish that wasnâ€™t the truth.
So Iâ€™m going down Ninth Avenue, and all of the sudden I looked up, and about two blocks away, I see this lesbian coming up the block. Okay? Now, I know this is Boulder, Colorado, right? So you guys are all like, â€œFuckinâ€™, hey, man, you know?â€ Like, â€œHow did you, like, know she was a lesbian, man?â€ â€œLike, thatâ€™s not cool.â€ â€œYou just looked at her and you just knew she was a lesbian?â€ â€œYou donâ€™t know her, how did you justâ€¦â€ â€œHow do you just know somebodyâ€™s a lesbian?â€ Easy. The same way you do. The same way other lesbians do. Itâ€™s not calculus. No, but I understand in 2021, youâ€™re not allowed to say you know â€œwhat a lesbian looks like,â€ right? Judging by your silence, yes, right? Yeah, youâ€™re not allowed, right? Whatâ€™s funny, if some white kid came in here, like 20 years old, hair slicked back, collar popped, loafers, no socks, youâ€™d be looking at him thinking, â€œAll right, frat boy, date rapist.â€ â€œHis dadâ€™s a judge. Heâ€™s not going to jail.â€ â€œYeah. Just killed five people in a drinking-and-driving accident.â€ â€œAlready has a new Dodge Challenger on the way.â€ Right? Yeah, youâ€™re allowed to see that, that you can see. Clear as day. Lesbian. I have no idea. No, but thatâ€™s how progressive you guys are. Right? You donâ€™t have any idea. Right? Like, letâ€™s play a game. Iâ€™ll just name different people you see and see the slides that come into your head, right? Construction worker. Sports fan. Painter. Skateboarder. Lesbian. Right? It all goes blank. Is that a lesbian? Am I aâ€¦? I mean, I have gay friends, but Iâ€™ve never noticed any sort of a throughline.
Listen, people, Iâ€™m not saying all lesbians look alike. I would never say some ignorant shit like that. However, I am saying, though, every once in a while, thereâ€™s a fucking layup. Right? Flattop, wallet chain, fuckinâ€™ walking up the street. Right? But even then, Iâ€™m not saying 100%. But gun to my head, I gotta go lesbian. Gotta go lesbian. Final answer, final answer, show me â€œlesbian.â€ Right?
So, anywayâ€¦ Sheâ€™s fuckinâ€™ walkinâ€™ up the street. Iâ€™m cominâ€™ down, right? And itâ€™s clear to me that if we keep walking the way weâ€™re walking, weâ€™re gonna bump into each other. I donâ€™t wanna bump into a woman, I donâ€™t want to bump into anybody in New York, so I do the gentlemanly thing. I clock whatâ€™s going on, so I just gradually shift over into my lane. Now everythingâ€™s fine, right? But then the weirdest thing happened. We walk like another 30 yards, and all of the sudden, she drifts back into my lane again. And Iâ€™m sitting there walking like, â€œWow, that was kind of crazy.â€ â€œThought I solved this problem.â€ All right, so I fuckinâ€™ dip into another lane again. Okay, Iâ€™m walking, we go another 30 yards, she comes back into my lane again. So now Iâ€™m up against the curb. So now Iâ€™m thinking, how do I do the politically correct math here? What am I supposed to be doing here? Am I supposed to step off into the bike lane and have some young kid on his electric bicycle come by, forty miles an hour, run me over, I go down to the pavement, knees and elbows? And for the rest of my life, every time it rains, I gotta think about this lesbian that walked me off the fuckinâ€™ block? Is that what Iâ€™m supposed to do? Am I supposed to give up the whole sidewalk? Like, â€œOh, your gayness!â€ Right? Or do I stiffen up my shoulder and protect my lane? Right?
Now, Iâ€™m not proud of this, but I chose the latter, all right? I was like, â€œLook, Iâ€™m 53.â€ â€œI moved twice. I have an AARP card. Iâ€™m the fuckinâ€™ victim here.â€ Soâ€¦ I stiffen up the shoulder and immediately Iâ€™m thinking this is gonna get crazy. Iâ€™ve never done this with a female before. This is in public, people are gonna see this shit, whatâ€™s gonna happen? But Iâ€™m not going to lie, she started closing in, she was moving, so I like leaned in, like I really got my legs underneath me, â€™cause she was built like a janitor and I was not gonna get spun around. I wasnâ€™t gettinâ€™ spun around. Not having that on the fuckinâ€™ logbook, right? So I lean into this shit, and at the last second, she turned her shoulder and we just missed shoulders, but our forearms still slapped together with significant enough force that it warranted a turnaround. Okay? Now, I know most of you guys drive, so I will break down pedestrian etiquette really quickly in New York City. This is the deal, if youâ€™re walking down the street in New York, youâ€™re walking and you just sort of brush sleeves with somebody, you donâ€™t have to stop. Just look over your shoulder, â€œSorry, man, my bad, have a nice day.â€ Right? Then thereâ€™s the next level. Moves up a little bit. Youâ€™re walking down the street, you actually bump into somebody, you actually have to turn around, â€œSorry, I didnâ€™t see you.â€ A little dojo bow, â€œMy bad.â€ Whatever you have to doâ€¦ â€œMy senseiâ€â€¦ to keep it from escalating. And then thereâ€™s the last one. Youâ€™re just walking down the street and you hit so fuckinâ€™ hard, you gotta turn around and go like old-school Dustin Hoffman-De Niro, like, â€œHey, Iâ€™m fuckinâ€™ walkinâ€™ here! Huh?â€ â€œI fuckinâ€™ moved twice, you didnâ€™t see that?â€ â€œYou drifted two times, huh?â€
So I turn around to have this confrontation, and let me tell you something, she never looked back. And Iâ€™m not gonna lie to you, that bugged me. That bugged me for like three days. Three days, Iâ€™m just walking around New York, â€œGoddamn fuckinâ€™ bullshit, thereâ€™s no fuckinâ€™ way you didnâ€™t do that on purpose!â€ â€œWho does that, who drifts?â€ You know? And Iâ€™m feeling this anger, itâ€™s just burning me up, and I know eventually itâ€™s gonna settle in my chest, and then one more time itâ€™s gonna be, â€œI sorry, Dada, I sorry.â€ Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t do this to my daughter, I canâ€™t do this to my kids.
So I started reading up on anger. Like, â€œhow to let go of this,â€ I think is what I Googled. And I found empathy. If you have empathy for somebody, you put yourself in their shoes, you can just, you know, figure out where theyâ€™re coming from, where youâ€™re coming from, meet in the middle, so I said, here we go, let me put myself in her shoes. What would cause somebody to accidentally drift into your lane twice? You know, so I just started throwing shit on the wall. Did she have a clubfoot? No. Did she just have a stroke? Did she have Bellâ€™s palsy of her left side? You know? Was she a mummy? Did she have a wooden leg? You know? Is she one of those fuckinâ€™ diagonal walkers? You get behind them at the airport, theyâ€™re walkinâ€™ too slow, you go around to the right, they start dragging their suitcase over there. You go over to the left, theyâ€™re coming back this way, you know? Itâ€™s like they just got off a ship. And everything was just like, no, no, no, cut! Right? And I was still mad. I was still fuckinâ€™ mad. So I said, â€œWho gives a shit? I donâ€™t give a fuck.â€ Lied to myself, said I didnâ€™t give a fuck, you know? So then I ended up going home. Then Iâ€™m washing the dishes, which is a very Zen-like thing to do. Itâ€™s a week later, you wash dishes, youâ€™re not thinking of anything. Your brain is empty, Iâ€™m washing the dishes, and then all of the sudden, the answer just came to me. It just floated into my head, and I just looked up. I was like, â€œOh, my God. I know why she did it.â€ I know why she bumped into me. She bumped into me because sheâ€™s a lesbian. It was right there. I was, like, looking nine miles down the street, looking under shrubs. It was right in front of my face. She did it because sheâ€™s a lesbian. All right, so judging by most of your silence, I will do this math for you, come on. Letâ€™s have a little empathy here. Put yourself in a lesbianâ€™s shoes, all right? Who do lesbians date? Women. Who do they move in with? Women. Who do they get in relationships with? Women. Who do they eventually marry? Women. And I was thinking like, â€œOh, my God. I did that.â€ I know what the fuck thatâ€™s like. I know what itâ€™s like to live with one of those fuckinâ€™ things. I know exactly what thatâ€¦ itâ€™s hopeless. Trying to make them happy. â€œHey, I bought you this shiny thing. Did I do it right, huh?â€ Trying to get them to take responsibility for their actions. Not gonna happen. The best youâ€™re gonna get is, â€œIâ€™m sorry, butâ€¦â€ I know what itâ€™s like to be winning a fuckinâ€™ argument, youâ€™re winning, and then they turn it around, theyâ€™re crying, youâ€™re apologizing. Youâ€™re thinking, what the fuck just happened? How am I losing this shit? I had you on the ropes. You feel so dumb, you got to go for a walk. And youâ€™re just thinking, how did I lose again? How did I lose again? And then you figure it out, it makes you feel stupid, and then you see some bald idiot with a giant orange mustache, youâ€™re like, â€œYou know what, why donâ€™t you take some of that shit?â€ â€œYou take some of that fuckinâ€™ anger.â€ Yeah. I feel so stupid that I got mad at that woman. I shouldnâ€™t have got mad at her, I should have bought her a beer. And just listen to her troubles and had empathy and be like, â€œItâ€™s not your fault. You married a woman, I did it too.â€ â€œYouâ€™re not gonna win. Thereâ€™s no winning this.â€ Yeah. Iâ€™m telling you, if you donâ€™t believe me, do a little people-watching. Take a look at the look on the average lesbianâ€™s face. I donâ€™t mean a lesbian in her twenties, sheâ€™s got her life ahead of her, sheâ€™s got Christmas in her eyes, right? I mean, a lesbian about 35, 36, starting to settle in to what the dealâ€™s gonna be, right? And then look across the bar, find a married guy about the same age. Look at the look on his face. Look at the look on her face, go back to his face. Itâ€™s the same fuckinâ€™ look. Yeah. And then look at gay guys. Some of the happiest people Iâ€™ve ever met in my life. Theyâ€™re almost too happy. Itâ€™s like, â€œHey, howâ€™s it going?â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œHi!â€ Almost floating across the room with that lack of estrogen just yanking down your fuckinâ€™ dreams. No. Now, look, it might be a front. Iâ€™m not saying all gay guys are just blissfully happy, but itâ€™s looking like a pretty good time to me. Dude, theyâ€™re some of the most positive people Iâ€™ve ever met in my life. Any idea you have, they support it. Theyâ€™re just like, â€œYes, yes, queen, yes!â€ â€œYouâ€™re fierce, you can do it!â€ Lesbians are up in the bar like a bunch of jaded cops. â€œItâ€™s all fuckinâ€™ bullshit.â€ â€œWhat the fuck was I thinking?â€ â€œU-Hauling after ten days, moving in. What the fuck was I thinking?â€ â€œSheâ€™s crazy!â€ No, Iâ€™m telling you, I think married men and lesbians need to start hanging out more, and we gotta put our heads together and try to solve our common problem, the women in our lives. So we can somehow attain the perceived happiness of the average gay dude out there. Yeah. So, if you believe in that shit, Iâ€™ll give you some advice. If youâ€™re gonna expand your fuckinâ€™ world of friends, Iâ€™ll give you some advice. You canâ€™t just hang out with any lesbian. All right? You gotta make sure youâ€™re hanging out with the dude in the relationship, right? And by â€œdude,â€ Iâ€™m not saying sheâ€™s manly, Iâ€™m not being ignorant. By â€œdude,â€ I just mean sheâ€™s the one that gets blamed for most of the shit. Right? â€˜Cause no relationship is balanced. Somebody is getting away with more. Somebodyâ€™s drafting behind the other. Itâ€™s like a bike race. Somebody else is taking the fuckinâ€™ weather in the face. [imitates fanfare] Right? Somebody else is fuckinâ€™ right behind. â€œOh, yeah, it really is wet.â€ Just kind of hiding under your fuckinâ€™ poncho. Male-female, female-female, they-they, whatever the fuck it is youâ€™re into. Every relationship, thereâ€™s the person that does the dishes and the person that lets them soak. Right? They donâ€™t let them soak. They know youâ€™re gonna do â€™em. Theyâ€™re just waitinâ€™ you out. After a while, you canâ€™t fuckinâ€™ take it anymore. Theyâ€™re just sitting there. You gotta go start doing them. Then what do they do? They sit in the other room and wait, like they donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing, and wait till they hear pots and pans, and thatâ€™s when the show starts. Thatâ€™s when they come running in like, â€œWhat?â€ â€œI was gonna do those!â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œNo, you werenâ€™t. Theyâ€™ve been sitting here eight hours.â€ â€œI got my hands in room-temperature water with scrambled eggs floating around.â€ â€œDonâ€™t gaslight me, youâ€™re a fuckinâ€™ animal.â€ â€œYou were raised by animals, get out of my sight.â€ â€œDonâ€™t yell at me!â€ Right? Yes. Every relationship has the person that will take the trash bag out of the trash barrel and do a littleâ€¦ Tie it off and then leave it slumped against the counter. Like it took two behind the ear in a mob hit, justâ€¦ And then thereâ€™s the person that actually picks it up and takes it out to the curb at night and puts it in the trash can, right? My wifeâ€™s hilarious, I love her, but sheâ€™s got some of the worst excuses ever. â€œWhy donâ€™t you ever take out the trash?â€ She goes, â€œI would, Iâ€™m just afraid of coyotes.â€ â€œIâ€™m afraid of the coyotes.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œSo am I! So am I!â€ â€œTheyâ€™re rabid dogs.â€ â€œThey hunt in packs of twos and threes.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t do it â€™cause you donâ€™t wanna do it â€™cause you know Iâ€™m gonna do it, just get the fuck away from me, please.â€ Iâ€™m telling youâ€¦ So, anywayâ€¦ I know I said a lot of divisive shit here tonight, so before I get out of here, before I get out of here, I want toâ€¦ Letâ€™s bring the room together. Itâ€™s a very divisive time. Everyone wants to feel safe. Letâ€™s do a nice, normal, mainstream topic, so everybody can drive home happy, no fights, all right? Sound good? All right, great. Letâ€™s talk abortion. There you go. Everybody has an opinion. â€œItâ€™s my body, itâ€™s my right.â€ â€œWell, then fuckinâ€™ drive to Arkansas, bitch!â€ Right? Everybody has an opinion. As do I, and I apologize that youâ€™re gonna have to listen to mine. Becauseâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna tell you right now. I have a really weird take on abortion. Iâ€™m gonna tell you that right from the get-go, okay? Iâ€™m 100% pro-choice, always have been.
[women cheering]
Ladies, I said it was weird. For the love of God. Stop getting in the trunk in the car. Wait till the end. Youâ€™re supposed to vet me first. Whoo! Fuckinâ€™ feet out the sunroof. I said I had a weird take. Pro-choice always made sense to me â€™cause I donâ€™t like people telling me what to do, and I was just like, itâ€™s your body. Who the fuck am I to tell you what to do with your body? So that always made sense. All right? However, I still think youâ€™re killing a baby. See? Thatâ€™s where it gets weird. Like, I sit on the fence and the whole thing makes sense to me. When anybodyâ€™s saying, like, â€œDonâ€™t tell me what to do.â€ â€œItâ€™s my body, my choice.â€ Thatâ€™s right, man, sheâ€™s right. Leave her the hell alone. â€œWell, youâ€™re killinâ€™ a baby!â€ Well, I mean, there is that. You know? If weâ€™re gonna be honest, that is the whole purpose of the procedure. Youâ€™re not going in there â€™cause you got an earache. Youâ€™re going in there â€™cause â€œI got a baby in me, get it the fuck out of there!â€ Right? You walk in with the baby, you come out without one. What happened to the baby, right? Something fuckinâ€™ happened. Soâ€¦ Pro-choice people like, â€œWell, itâ€™s not a life yet.â€ â€œItâ€™s not a baby yet ifâ€¦â€ I donâ€™t know what they say. â€œBefore you do it the first Thursday or the last Tuesday and you spin around one time.â€ They dance between the right trucks. â€œItâ€™s not a baby yet,â€ thatâ€™s what they say, which may or may not be true. I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m not a doctor, but Iâ€™ll tell you, my gut tells me that doesnâ€™t make sense. Itâ€™s not a baby yet. That would be like if I was making a cake and I poured some batter in a pan and I put it in the oven, and then five minutes later you came by and you grabbed the pan, you threw it across the floor. And I went, â€œWhat the fuck?! You just ruined my birthday cake.â€ And then youâ€™re like, â€œWell, that wasnâ€™t a cake yet.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œWell, it would have been.â€ â€œIf you didnâ€™t do what you just did, there would have been a cake in 50 minutes.â€ â€œSomething happened to that cake, you cake-murdering son of a bitch!â€ Right? Now, before all you pro-life people get excited, I think itâ€™s great youâ€™re killing your babies. Itâ€™s fantastic. Help Mother Nature out. Thereâ€™s too many of us. Itâ€™s been 130 degrees out. Animals are going extinct. Thereâ€™s plastic in the fuckinâ€™ ocean. We donâ€™t need any more fuckinâ€™ people. And especially, if youâ€™re honest with yourself, have you done anything great with your life? Is the person youâ€™re banging doing anything great? The answer to both of those questions is no, what are the odds youâ€™re gonna make a great person? Iâ€™m not saying youâ€™re gonna make a bad person, youâ€™re just gonna make another person that doesnâ€™t go when the light turns green â€™cause theyâ€™re staring at their fuckinâ€™ phone.
All right, Iâ€™m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. This was amazing.
[cheering, whistling]
Thanks again. Thank you for coming out, everybody. I really appreciate it, good night.

<START>
Thank you so much.
(audience applauds)
You know, thatâ€™s a wonderful surprise. This night, is that it? (audience laughs) You know, I been in this 35 years, was it, like, eight people? (audience laughs) I donâ€™t know, I guess I expected more.
(audience laughs)
(chuckles) This is incredible. Youâ€™re f*cking amazing. Gary Clark, Jr., and the whole band, just, is amazing. (audience applauding) What an amazing night. When I first got the call, when the Kennedy Center, I would receive the Twain Prize, I said to my wife, â€œDonâ€™t give them any of our credit card information.â€ â€œThe Kennedys wanna give you the Twain.â€ (audience laughs) â€œAnd it could be yours, just, thereâ€™s some shipping costs.â€ But I Googled it, (audience laughs) and itâ€™s real. Itâ€™s a real award. Itâ€™s incredible, and to see you all here, masked, is so f*cking weird, I canâ€™t even tell you. It does feel like a dystopian movie, or like a weird O. Henry story, where at the end they say to the comedian, you know, â€œYou can perform, but no mouths,â€ (audience laughing) â€œthere can beâ€¦â€ You know, and backstage, Iâ€™m sure the comediansâ€™re like, â€œYo, did you see those eye crinkles? I was f*cking killing it.â€ (audience laughs) â€œOh my god, they were squinting.
(audience applauding)
It was amazing.â€ This is a Faustian bargain, but Iâ€™m so glad for us to finally be getting back to normal, and finally getting back to honoring the non-essential worker, thatâ€™s reallyâ€¦ (audience laughs) Youâ€™re welcome. I think the pandemic taught us one thing; itâ€™s that, really, you donâ€™t need any of us, do you? (audience laughs) You need the grocery store, got it.
This is a wonderful award. To see all my friends here, and all the people Iâ€™ve worked with for their years. Just, it reminds me of just how many people I carriedâ€¦ (audience laughs) for so long.
(audience applauds)
Thereâ€™re a lot of jokes about how I look (audience laughs) Touche. (audience laughs) I am a Jew. This is what happens. (audience laughs) (laughs) Black donâ€™t crack. But Jews, we age like avocados. (audience laughs)
I have so many people to thank, really, for all this. First and foremost, my mother is here, who is right there.
(audience applauding)
Who is gonna be 90. There you go. Come on, woman! This year, she is gonna be 90. Or as thatâ€™s known in the US Senate, a freshman. (audience laughs)
You know, everybody talked about work ethic, thatâ€™s where I learned it. 1971 or 1972, my father left the family, and we had tough times. It was tough, and she coulda rolled over, but she didnâ€™t. She got up, and she showed me that youâ€™re not your circumstances. Youâ€™re not what happens to you, youâ€™re what you make of it. And she got up, and she got her *** in gear, and she gave us a good life. And I could never repay her for that.
(audience applauding)
And the punchline, my father died 10 years ago. Winner, winner, chicken dinner, (audience laughs) thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m saying. Yeah! Whoâ€™s laughing now? Yeah, I still have issues. (audience laughs)
I wanna thank my brother, who is here. My brother, who was so academically gifted that I knew I would have to go in a different direction, so, I thank him for that.
(audience applauding)
My family is here. That is my boy. I canâ€™t tell you, and this is advice for anybody. If you like to do dumb sh*t, (audience laughs) which is something I like very much to do, I cannot recommend more, creating a small child (audience laughs) who also likes to do dumb s*it. Because then, you can do the dumb sh*t and say, â€œItâ€™s what he want, what?â€ (audience laughs)
Little Maggie is also here. Nothingâ€™s better than when little Maggie says to me, â€œYou wanna go for a drive?â€ And we get in the car and we go for a drive. And if any of you wanna have a transcendent experience, get in the car with your daughter and drive down the Jersey shore, and listen to Jay Cole â€œSheâ€™s Mineâ€, parts one and two (audience laughing) as the sun is setting. And itâ€™s beautiful. And I canâ€™t be prouder of the both of you, and I love you both so much.
(audience applauds)
And my wife, whoâ€¦ I met my wife on a blind date in 1995. And our first date, I had it all picked out. We went to a little hole-in-the-wall place called Lupeâ€™s East LA Kitchen on 6th Avenue and Watts in New York. And we went there because I am a motherf*cking baller. (audience laughs) But it was a really interesting date, because she didnâ€™t say anything the whole time. (audience laughs) So afterwards, I thought, â€œWell, Iâ€™ll take one last shot.â€
â€œItâ€™s not the fragility of the audience, itâ€™s the fragility of leaders.â€
I was walking her back, she lived on Mulberry Street. I said, â€œYou wanna just duck into a bar real quick, and just have a quick drink?â€ Well, one scotch and soda (audience titters) and it was on. (audience laughs) And I was hooked. And I have to say, again, a lesson for all of you, if youâ€™re gonna go on a date, make sure the place has a liquor license. (audience laughs) Because if it doesnâ€™t, you could miss out on your favorite person in the world.
(audience coos)
(audience applauds)
Love you. Still the best laugh I ever earned.
And to all the people that came here tonight to see this, I canâ€™t thank you enough. Itâ€™s ironic, I carry around, always, a quote by Twain. It just so happens (audience laughing) that I am never without it. And itâ€™s about ideas, and the quote is, â€œThe radical invents the views. But when he has worn them out, the conservative adopts them.â€ And I keep that with me as a reminder that even for Twain, theyâ€™re not all f*cking gems. (audience laughs)
(audience applauds)
Even the most celebrated artist amongst us ***** the bed. (audience laughs) But the point is this, what we do is an iterative business. Itâ€™s a grind. Itâ€™s work. The best amongst us just keep at it. I began in 1987. And my journey began, itâ€™s the weirdest thing, I walked into a basement in Greenwich Village called the Comedy Cellar. And when youâ€™re a comic, you look in a room, and 200 seats are facing one way. And thereâ€™s one stool, and it has a light shining on it. And you walk into that room, and go, â€œThatâ€™s gonna be my chair. Iâ€™m gonna sit in that one.â€ And you spend the rest of your career trying to earn that stool. And some nights, man, you donâ€™t even belong in the club, you donâ€™t even belong on the street. But you get back at it, because there isnâ€™t any fixed point in comedy where you make it or you donâ€™t make it. Itâ€™s the journey, with the greatest friends I could ever possibly have made. And the terrible nights, and the great nights, and the fun we have sitting at the table. Thatâ€™s what this weekendâ€™s been about for me, is catching up with great friends, and sitting at the table, and laughing our ****** off, and us all going, like, â€œOh god, what time do we have to be there tonight?â€ Not that youâ€™re not great. (audience laughs)
And thereâ€™s a lot of talk right now about whatâ€™s gonna happen to comedy. You know, there was the slap. And what does the slap say about comedy, and is comedy gonna survive in this new moment? Now Iâ€™ve got news for you, comedy survives every moment. And having Bassem, here, is a really great example of the true threat to comedy.
(audience applauds)
Itâ€™s not the woke police thatâ€™re gonna be an existential threat to comedy. Itâ€™s not the Fresh Prince, itâ€™s the crown prince. Itâ€™s not the fragility of audiences, itâ€™s the fragility of leaders. You donâ€™t owe us anything, as an audience. If we say sh*t you donâ€™t like, say sh*t back, do whatever you gotta do. Donâ€™t get up and hit us. (audience laughs) (attendee cheers) But thatâ€™s just the game weâ€™re in. We talk **** for a living, you talk **** back, and we just gotta be better than you. And weâ€™ve gotta find a way to entertain you. But the threat to comedy, comedy doesnâ€™t change the world, but itâ€™s a bellwether. Weâ€™re the banana peel in the coal mine. (audience titters) When a society is under threat, comedians are the ones who get sent away first. Itâ€™s just a reminder to people that democracy is under threat. Authoritarians are the threat to comedy, to art, to music, to thought, to poetryâ€¦
(audience applauding)
â€¦to progress, to all those things. All that **** is a red herring. It ainâ€™t the pronoun police, itâ€™s the secret police. It always has been, and it always will be. And this manâ€™s decapitated visage (audience laughs) is a reminder to all of us that what we have is fragile, and precious. And the way to guard against it isnâ€™t to change how audiences think. Itâ€™s to change how leaders lead. And so, I thank you so much for your support tonight, and for this award.
(audience applauding)
Thank you. Good night. Unbelievable.

[announcer] Now everybody put your hands togetherâ€¦ for Pete Davidson!
[cheers and applause]
Hey. Hello. Wow. Thanks. Thank you. Alright. So howâ€™s your year going? Good? Iâ€™ve had a really weird year. I had an AIDS scare this year. Yeah, I did, and youâ€™re like, â€œPete, wow, whatâ€™s going on in your life? Are you sharing needles? You doing heroin? Are you having tons of unprotected sex?â€ No, Kanye told me I had AIDS. And uhâ€¦ And heâ€™s aâ€¦ Heâ€™s a genius, so I was like, â€œOh, fuck.â€ I was like, â€œI better call my doctor.â€ The guy who made College Dropout thinks I have AIDS. So I went to the doctor, I actually got checked. Because I was like, â€œMaybe heâ€™s right, I donâ€™t know.â€ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ So my doctor told me, I donâ€™t have AIDS, I just look like I have it, soâ€¦ itâ€™s a completely different thing. You know whatâ€™s really funny about that? AIDS is just such an old school thing, like, â€œYou have AIDS.â€ Itâ€™s just such a â€™90s, early2000s thing toâ€¦ You know what I mean? John Mulaney called me, heâ€™s like, â€œAIDS? You should spread a rumor that he has polio!â€
Does anybody else secretly hope that Kanye pulls, like aâ€¦ Mrs. Doubtfire? They come home one day, and theyâ€™re like, â€œThis is the new housekeeper,â€ and heâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s up, fam?â€ Yeah, itâ€™s a really weird thing to go through. Thereâ€™s because you know, people try to give you advice, but even friends that are older, theyâ€™re like, â€œI donâ€™tâ€¦ know.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œIt looks pretty bad, bro, I hopeâ€¦ Good luck, sorry, here if you need,â€ but like, no advice. No one was like, â€œThis is what you do.â€ Everyone was like, â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€¦ yeah. You staying with your mom? You in a safe spot?â€ People ask me weird questions. So thatâ€™s the only thing I donâ€™t like. They ask this weird stuff. Like the other day, somebody came up to me and was like, â€œI heard youâ€™re friends with Jack Harlow!â€ And I am. Heâ€™s a very great, talented rapper. Heâ€™s a cool dude. Nice guy. So weâ€™re pals, right? And Kanye put him on his new album. Even though Iâ€™ve been friends with him for like two, three years, you know, he did it anyway. People come up to me and theyâ€™re like, â€œHow does that make you feel? Does that bother you? Does that get under your skin?â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, heâ€™s a rapper.â€ Thatâ€™s his field, thatâ€™s what they do. That doesnâ€™t hurt my feelings. It would hurt my feelings if I saw, like, Bill Burr at Sunday service. Iâ€™d be like, â€œWhat the fuck, Bill?â€ Heâ€™d be like, â€œFind God, Petey, go fuck yourself! Jesus!â€ Yeah, I donâ€™t get it. A lot of people are very angry. Itâ€™s always 5050 when I go outside. Yeah, it is. Itâ€™s always 5050. Either someoneâ€™s just like, â€œHey, man, youâ€™re really cool, thatâ€™s great.â€ Or someoneâ€™s like, â€œHey, yo! Fuck you! Fuck you! Yeah, you!â€ I always am like, â€œCanâ€™t be me.â€
Itâ€™s weird, itâ€™s all weird becauseâ€¦ right before, December 2021, I call it â€œthe before timeâ€. Before my life was ruined, it was likeâ€¦ Yeah, itâ€™s like COVID happened and then another COVID happened personally to me. That was a really good month, December 2021. I remember, I went to a Knicks game with my good pals, Jon Stewart and Chris Rock, right? So we went to this Knicks gameâ€¦ Yeah, theyâ€™re the best. And very hilarious that they hang out with me. Itâ€™s really weird. But Iâ€™m stoked, because theyâ€™re heroes. So weâ€™re watching the game, and itâ€™s the game when Steph Curry breaks the threepoint record, right? And I remember he broke the threepoint record in the first quarter, and just somehow, how we were placed, because he shot it from over there and me, Jon, and Chris were under the basket. So like, in the picture that everybody put out, thatâ€™s like hereâ€™s him breaking the record, us three are just, likeâ€¦ Like, we all lookâ€¦ We completely photobombed his, whatever, basketball card thatâ€™s going to be, like, forever. And it was such a good night, but itâ€™s so weird because since then, horrible things have happened to me and Chris. So Jon Stewart, if youâ€™re watchingâ€¦ watch your fucking back. Lucky bastard. Itâ€™s like Chris gets slapped, I get decapitated, then Jon Stewart wins the Mark Twain award. Soâ€¦ I havenâ€™t been on stage much, but Iâ€™ve been trying to make a joke about Epsteinâ€™s plane funny. Thatâ€™s usually how it goes. In any room that I ever pitch this joke on. But I just, likeâ€¦ hear me out. The guy, obviously, bad dude. You got to get that out of the way. Bad dude, shouldnâ€™t do that stuff. But I didnâ€™t understand why people were mad at all the dudes that took a free plane ride. Like, the Jeffery Epstein doc came out and this dude raped and did a bunch of terrible stuff to little young girls, and then people would be like, â€œCan you believe Chris Tucker rode on that plane?â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œYeah, have you ever tried to fly commercial? From fucking L.A. to New York? Itâ€™s a fucking nightmare.â€ Because Iâ€™ve been in situations nowâ€¦ Let me rephrase that. I know a dude who gives me free plane rides, right? I donâ€™t really know what he does, he tells me heâ€™s in the â€œwaste managementâ€ business. Thatâ€™s what he says, â€œIâ€™m in waste management. Iâ€™m a garbageman.â€ I go, â€œYeah, tons of garbagemen have private jets, soâ€¦â€ But I just donâ€™t ask. Iâ€™m just like, â€œOkay, whatever.â€ Because I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything wrong with taking the plane with a guy. You donâ€™t have to support what the guy does. So I fly with one pedophile, right? If you fly commercial, thereâ€™s at least, like, five pedophiles. And you donâ€™t know who they are. I know who mine is, itâ€™s right in front of me with a mimosa and some strawberry chocolates. Thank you guys for being out here. You guys ready to start?

Make some noise for your first comic, Neko White! L.A., one more time for Pete Davidson, give him a round of applause, huh? Yes! Pleasure to be in front of yâ€™all tonight. My name is Neko White. I made a very simple goal. And that is to mind my business at the highest level possible. Now, I take this very seriously. You guys in here tonight, I appreciate that, while youâ€™re in here. Once we get outside, whatever happens to youâ€¦ is not my business, you understand me? If we in here, we cool. You outside, you get robbed, you see me, donâ€™t make eye contact. Because Iâ€™m telling you now, if you look at me, â€œNeko, help!â€ Hey, man, it was a good show, Iâ€™ma holler at you. I mind my business. Now recently, I went to get a haircut. As soon as I walked into the barber shop, my barber goes, â€œHey, man. You see this shit with Dwyane Wadeâ€™s son?â€ â€œNo. Thatâ€™s not my business. I got bills, bro. I got a whole real life.â€ Do you understand that where I live, I have a crackhead doorman? And where I live, we donâ€™t hire doormen. This lady just showed up one day. She held the door for one person, and sheâ€™s been back every day since. And what pisses me off is that she has a custom greeting just for me. When I walk in the building, she goes, â€œMr. Neko White. Ow, ow, ow.â€ What the fuck does that mean? â€œOw, ow, owâ€? I donâ€™t speak crack Morse code, what are you saying to me? So no, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on with Dwyane Wade or his richass kid. I said that, my barber go, â€œNah. See, Dwyane Wade had a son that was born a boy, but now, at 11 years old, his son say, â€˜Iâ€™m a woman on the inside.â€™ So now when he get older, he goinâ€™ to chop his dick off. And he gonna become a woman. Now ainâ€™t that shit weird?â€ â€œIâ€™m here for a fade, man. Little off the side, square in the back. What are you doing right now? Do you realize that itâ€™s only 10:02 in the morning? Do you know that? Do you know I smoked the Sativa before I came here? Do you know that? Do you know how paranoid I am right now? And youâ€™re going to ask me that cancelableass question? In front of all these mirrors in this barber shop? Do you know how many â€˜mesâ€™ I see in either direction right now? Iâ€™m here for a fade, man. Little off the side, square in the back.â€ My barber didnâ€™t flinch. â€œAinâ€™t that shit weird?â€ â€œYeah. Yeah, itâ€™s weirdâ€¦ that you know what an 11yearold that youâ€™re not related to want to do with their dick. Thatâ€™s very weird. Iâ€™m just saying. I have a nephew thatâ€™s 11. Know what I know about him? He 11, and thatâ€™s where it stops. I donâ€™t know nothing extra. I donâ€™t know his name, I donâ€™t know his birthday, and I donâ€™t know his dick aspirations. But he 11.â€ When I said that, my barber goes, â€œAlright, Mr. HolierThanThou. What if it was your son?â€ â€œWhat if it was my son? Iâ€™d still need a fade. But you want to play hypotheticals with me? I do that all day, brother! Letâ€™s do that!â€ What if it was my son? I could see that. I could see me walking to my sonâ€™s room, knocking on his door. â€œHey, baby boy, look here. Your papaâ€™s tired. Would you mind taking the garbage out for me, Big Dog? Iâ€™d really appreciate that.â€ â€œDad?â€ â€œYeah, whatâ€™s going on?â€ [whimpering softly] You know when a kid really think they telling you something? [whimpering softly] â€œDad, umâ€¦ Iâ€™m a woman on the inside.â€ â€œI just asked you to take out the garbage. Did you know it was only 10:02 in the morning right now? Did you know that? You know I smoked the Sativa before I came in here. You ever notice how many mirrors you got in your room? Iâ€™ll be right back, kid.â€ [imitates door closing] [exhales] Okay. â€œHey, baby girl, would you mind taking that garbage out for your papa?â€ L.A., youâ€™ve been excellent. My nameâ€™s Neko White. Thank you!
[cheers and applause]
Now then, you ready for more show? I donâ€™t think you can hear me. Are you ready for more show? Coming to the stage is a very dear friend of mine from New York City. Yâ€™all, put your hands together for Giulio Gallarotti!
[cheers and applause]
One more time for Neko, guys! Let him hear it.
[cheers and applause]
Yeah. Sound about right? Yeah, that sounds good. Good. Feeling good. You know, comedians travel a lot. So we see a lot of crazy stuff. I saw something on a plane the other day that I couldnâ€™t believe was on a plane. Just a guyâ€¦ with a falcon. And it wasnâ€™t in a cage, just on his arm. And I was like, â€œHow is that allowed on a plane? You can just bring a falcon on a plane? I canâ€™t bring four ounces of water on a plane. But I can bring a falcon? Birds of prey? No problem.â€ Thatâ€™s crazy. I started thinking about it, and Iâ€™m like, the idea of a falcon having to fly in a plane. The flight was only an hour! The falcon can easily fly there on its own. I was convinced that right before we actually got on the plane, the guy was just going to be like, â€œAlright dude, see you there.â€ How is this allowed? When I saw the falcon, I was making a video. I made sure I got the falcon in there with a cameo. I was editing that video for two or three months, and I was just looking at myself every day, and I just started hating the way that I look. Specifically, I was a little heavier too, in the video. My bodyâ€¦ I was just not that down. [gags] I donâ€™t gain weight in a masculine way. When I gain weight, it immediately just starts to be likeâ€¦ I start to get all curvy! I feel like as a guy, you donâ€™t want your descriptive word to be â€œvoluptuous.â€ Oh yeah, Gâ€™s thick, dude. Itâ€™s crazy. Itâ€™s amazing, like, if you can see yourself on a video, thatâ€™s a great way to know that youâ€™ve gained weight. But otherwise, how do you find out? Typically, your rudest friend will tell you. Which is a crazy thing to be doing. Iâ€™ll never forget the last time this happened to me, I went to visit one of my friends, and the person who told me Iâ€™d gained weight was the guy who mows his lawn. Heâ€™s a very nice guy, but doesnâ€™t speak English at all. But still, he was able to convey to me that he thought Iâ€™d gained weight. Which Iâ€™ll never forget. Because I show up, Iâ€™m like, â€œHey, whatâ€™s up?â€ He goes, â€œPapiâ€¦â€ And I was in denial, I was like, â€œMaybe he just thinks I look strong or something.â€ I donâ€™t know how one could ever think that this means strong. So I just said, â€œOh, thank you, papi.â€ And he made sure to clarify. He goes, â€œNo, papiâ€¦â€ And to make sure there was no mistake in my brain, he just starts goingâ€¦ [lips smacking] Iâ€™m like, â€œDude, youâ€™re a dick.â€ Isnâ€™t that sad? I donâ€™t know. I canâ€™t imagine ever saying some shit like that to somebodyâ€™s face. I would at least wait for them to leave the room. Then Iâ€™d be like, â€œMan, he looks terrible.â€ I say â€œbroâ€ a lot when I talk, and then sometimes I get selfconscious that Iâ€™m going to get grouped in with a group of people that I feel like I shouldnâ€™t be associated with. You know, rambunctious, young white men. Iâ€™m like to the point to where I see a group of bros, I actually get disgusted. Iâ€™m like, â€œLook at theseâ€¦ fucking bros.â€ It can ruin my mood. I went to dinner, it was a sushi restaurant that I was really looking forward to going to eat at. It was fancy. I sit down. They seat me next to these bros. And Iâ€™m looking over there like, â€œLook at these fucking bros.â€ Theyâ€™re not even going to appreciate this meal. Theyâ€™re going to be ordering shit that isnâ€™t even on the menu. â€œCan we get some sake bombs?â€ Their dads are probably paying. Dude, fuck this. So I was like, â€œYou know what? Iâ€™m going to monitor them. To make sure theyâ€™re being wellbehaved.â€ I donâ€™t know what power I have. Justâ€¦ to prove myself right. And as it turns out, these bros, were wonderful gentlemen. They were great guys. I swear, they were mildmannered and polite, compassionate with the waitstaff. They were engaging in thoughtprovoking conversation. While maintaining their inside voices the entire time. I was like, â€œThese bros were raised right. These bros are pros.â€ Seriously, it was as if these bros had achieved the next level of â€œbrodomâ€. Which I didnâ€™t even know was possible. You guys probably think that perhaps they werenâ€™t bros at all. But they were, because they were still doing all the shit that bros do, but just in a much more classy and sophisticated manner. Iâ€™ll give you the best example. A plate of sushi comes over. One of the bros scoops up a piece, perfect chopstick work. And then he takes a bite, and he just started really earnestly enjoying it. And then he said the most bro thing you could ever say, but in a much more classy and refined way. So Iâ€™ll never forget, heâ€™s like, â€œFire.â€ â€œFire.â€ I said, â€œSend some sake bombs over there on me, dude. This broâ€™s awesome.â€ Guys, thank you very much, I really appreciate it. Aw, it was super fun. You guys ready for the next comedian? If you make some noise, Iâ€™ll bring her out, make some noise!
[cheers and applause]
Guys, the next comedian coming to the stage, sheâ€™s amazing. One of my best friends. I love her. Please give it up for Carly Aquilino!
[cheers and applause]
Wow! Thank you, oh my God, thank you guys so much! Howâ€™s everybody feeling, good? Good, we love it. Did you guys hear thereâ€™s a new variant? We donâ€™t care, right? None of us? Weâ€™re all here, weâ€™re having fun. I did all the things. Anytime they tell me thereâ€™s a new variant, Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, I got the vaccinesâ€ when I still wasnâ€™t sure about the vaccines. Like, I trusted the vaccines blindly. My friends were like, â€œI trust science!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know science at all. Iâ€™m sorry. Never learned it. Donâ€™t know anything about it.â€ Iâ€™m kind of dealing with the vaccine the way I deal with men in my life. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ll do this, butâ€¦ I wonâ€™t be surprisedâ€¦ if I end up regretting it.â€ I miss a lot of things about the lockdown. Is that bad to say? [audience] No! No! I took seven walks a day. I miss those videos that went viral every single day of just a woman that didnâ€™t want to wear her mask. I love that lady, I love them. It was always the same thing, too. It was just some lady like, â€œYou canâ€™t tell meâ€¦â€ Iâ€™m sorry that sheâ€™s Southern. Itâ€™s justâ€¦ that she was always Southern. â€œYou canâ€™t tell me what to do.â€ And the other person was just like, â€œMaâ€™am, this is a Long John Silverâ€™s andâ€¦ youâ€™re not wearing any shoes.â€ Iâ€¦ I went through a lot, kind of, during the lockdown. Iâ€™m 31 now but I turned 30 during the whole thing. Thank you! Wow, are you guys all 30? Like, every single one of you? Thatâ€™s cool. I went through this thing, though, where I thought about where I would be at this point in my life. Like, what I would have thought as a teenager. Do you ever do that? It messes me up. Like, if you would have asked me at 15 years old, I would be like, â€œUm, okay. First of all, hereâ€™s the stuff thatâ€™s going to happen. 31, ew, thatâ€™s disgusting, butâ€¦ So, Iâ€™m definitely going to get married when Iâ€™m 20. For sure. Thatâ€™s happening. And then, Iâ€™m just going to go to Europe for five years, because that doesnâ€™t cost any money. Thatâ€™s free. And then by the time Iâ€™m 31, Iâ€™m going to have three kids, just be a stayathome mom.â€ And now Iâ€™m 31, and Iâ€™m always like, â€œDo I haveâ€¦ two tampons in right now?â€ I donâ€™t even knowâ€¦ I donâ€™t even know where they go. Honestly. Iâ€¦ I have no wayâ€¦ I lose them constantly. I have no idea where they are. Thatâ€™s my biggest fear as a grown woman. Can you imagine? By the way, that happened to me. And I donâ€™t want to talk about it, but Iâ€™ll tell you guys everything. So I went to go to the bathroom. And I pull my pants down and I look down, and I saw two strings. And I was likeâ€¦ [gasps] â€œAm I a ceiling fan? Whyâ€¦? Why exactly are there two strings coming out of my body right now?â€ I donâ€™t know if you guys know this, anything more than one string is classified as an emergency. Thatâ€™s bad, itâ€™s a bad vibe. I had to go to the doctor. My poor gyno, this poor woman, I feel so bad for her. She hates me, I know that she does. Iâ€™m always going to her with problems that I make up, like, I always think Iâ€™m pregnant. Every single month I think Iâ€™m pregnant. Even if I donâ€™t have sex, Iâ€™m like, â€œMm, I donâ€™t know, happened to Mary. It could definitely happen to me.â€ The last time I went in to her for that, she said, â€œLet me ask you a question. The person that you were with, did he withdraw?â€ Took me a second, definitely took me a second to realize what she said. And then when I figured it out, I was like, â€œThat was so classy.â€ Honestly, I felt like a princess. I was like, â€œThis was really nice for me. Thank you so much.â€ I had never heard it said that way. â€œWithdrawâ€? I was like, â€œGirlâ€¦ he deposits. Heâ€™s making a lot of transactions, andâ€¦ itâ€™s bad.â€ I also went through a breakup during the pandemic which was kind of crazy. You know itâ€™s bad when in the middle of a lockdown somebody looks at you and theyâ€™re like, â€œHey, we should see other people.â€ I was like, â€œThatâ€™s illegal, butâ€¦ I get it.â€ You know? So now Iâ€™m dating again, and itâ€™s hard. You canâ€™t do it. How am I supposed to go out and meet people? When I was young, I would worry. I would worry so much when I went out with a guy. I would be like, â€œIs he going to kill me?â€ And now I would prefer it. Like â€œIâ€¦ Iâ€™m done. No, Iâ€™m done. Thank you. Iâ€™m all set. Iâ€™ve seen enough. Iâ€™m done.â€ Iâ€™ve realized that I have very bad judgment when it comes to men. I was at a bar, and I see this guy at the other end of the bar and Iâ€™m with my friends, and he had four tattoos on his face. And I saw it, and I was like, â€œIâ€™m going to fix it. Whatever it is, I will fix that.â€ Andâ€¦ my friends were like, â€œI think heâ€™s in a gang.â€ I was like, â€œI think youâ€™re jealous of me.â€ Likeâ€¦ â€œIâ€™m sorry. I have a boyfriend, you donâ€™t. Likeâ€¦ Girl, if you canâ€™t find a man, just say that.â€ And thatâ€™s really how I feel. Iâ€™m sorry, but itâ€™s a lot of jealousy. But I feel like we donâ€™t see the red flags. We want to see the good in people. I always make up excuses for guys. Iâ€™ll go out on date, my friends will be like, â€œHey, how was your first date?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œUmâ€¦ [tearfully] well, he made me cry, and heâ€™s definitely a liar, and I think heâ€™s married. And I think he stole 20 dollars out of my bag, butâ€¦ thereâ€™s just something about him. I really doâ€¦ I feel good about this.â€
Thank you guys so much, youâ€™re such a fun crowd. Are you ready to keep this show going? I want you to give a warm welcome to such a funny guy, Dave Sirus!
[cheers and applause]
Alright, how you guys doing? Everything went great. Great, well, my nameâ€™s Dave, Iâ€™ll be your Jew for the evening. But honestly, thank you all so much for being here. It is so amazing for me to see all you, to be here, to see that my friendship with Pete is finally paying off. Yeah, Iâ€™m Jewish. Iâ€™m also Russian. Soâ€¦ thatâ€™s fun now. Yeah, Iâ€™m a Russian Jew, so you know what that means: Iâ€™m two kinds of untrustworthy. But honestly though, I feel like even if Russia had never done anything, people still wouldnâ€™t trust us just for the accent. Because like, when you have a Russian accent, you kind of always sound like youâ€™re about to lie about something. Itâ€™s just taking you a second to figure it out, like, the first time I talked to my landlord, he was like, [in Russian accent] â€œOh, you should rent this apartment. Uh, youâ€¦ wonâ€™t be sorry. Oh, you should meet my daughter. She isâ€¦ [deep sigh] â€¦beautiful.â€ [normal voice] So I should tell you guys a little bit about myself. Iâ€™ve always been creepy. That wasnâ€™t the joke. I No, like honestly, ever since I was a kid, I was just always a really weird kid. But like, I didnâ€™t know how weird everyone else thought I was. I think that happens with weird kids. I didnâ€™t even realize how crazy of a thought it was until I grew up, and if I was going through something, my dad would be like, â€œListen, weâ€™re just proud of you for not being a serial killer.â€ Like wait, what did I do? So the first clue I ever had about how weird everyone else thought I was was in the seventh grade. My parents got this letter from the school board that said, â€œCongratulations, David has been selected for a very special program called Life Skills.â€ And I was so dumb, I thought this proved I was gifted. So I go to this weeklong program thatâ€™s in a building far away from my normal school. I open the door, and this is exactly what happened, I see there are two eager grad students and the nine most fuckedup kids in my school. I mean the kids who were caught smoking, drinking, fucking, fighting, the girls who got pregnant, the guy who got them all pregnant, and me. Even though, like unlike these other kids, I hadnâ€™t really gotten in trouble. My grades were fine, I was, and would stay a virgin for eight more years. Yet I was in this class with the dangerous kids. And itâ€™s only now as an adult, do I finally realize what was going on. That I was the scariest kid in my school. Because all the other kids in this class knew what they did to be put into this class. They were all there for a very specific onpaper reason. But with me, it was just a feeling! That the whole faculty agreed on to separate me now. So, that same year, I had this one teacher, Mr. Marigan. He was my favorite teacher. And hereâ€™s the thing, I was really weird, I didnâ€™t have any friends, I loved attention, which is why this is happening. So I really needed someone to talk to. If youâ€™re a weird kid, you find someone, your family, a teacher. For me, that was the cool science teacher I had. Mr. Marigan. Because even if I was having a bad day, I could still tell him a couple of jokes in class when I walked in that I knew heâ€™d appreciate more than these dumb kids. So Iâ€™d be like, â€œHey, Mr. Marigan, I read in this book that I can talk to dead people if I have a pint of goatâ€™s blood, a human thumb, and a paper plate. Do you have any plates?â€ Yeah, exactly. Kid jokes. Ten years later, my little brother became best friends with Mr. Mariganâ€™s son. This is really what he said to my brother. He goes, â€œOh, wow, youâ€™re Davidâ€™s brother? That kid scared the shit out of me. Yeah, the â€˜talk to dead peopleâ€™ kid. Is he in jail?â€ And I said to my brother, â€œNo way. No way. I know Mr. Marigan loved me.â€ I was, like, his favorite student. And I have proof, because that year my mom had made a deal with me. I could only go to camp if my worst grade for the year was a B or better. And I knew I wasnâ€™t going to go, because I actually got a really bad grade on Mariganâ€™s final, I was going to get more like a D+. And then last day of school, I got my report card, and I was I swear to God shocked, because I got my B. And I knew I didnâ€™t deserve it. I figured, â€œHe knows how hard Iâ€™m working and how much I wanted it. Iâ€™m a good student, he gave me some extra points.â€ Whatever it was, I just knew he hooked me up for some reason. And that meant a lot to me. That was why Mr. Marigan was my favorite teacher for years after that. Untilâ€¦ I got to hear the other half of that story. This is really what he said to my brother. He goes, â€œLook, Iâ€™m going to tell you how much that kid freaked me out. I donâ€™t know how he did it, I donâ€™t know how he figured out how to do it. But somehow, some way, when I was doing his grade point average at the end of the year, it equaled out to a perfect 66.6. I was so scared I gave him a B.â€ Yeah, turns out, Marigan did not understand me at all. But, it did get me into camp. Which, by the way, was a terrible experience I wish I hadnâ€™t gone to. Honestly, I think the reason I was so weird, part of it, is that my mom had me really young. She was 18, I love my mom, but she wasnâ€™t ready for how weird I would be. Hereâ€™s a perfect example. So, the next year, I was probably 13, and like I said, I was really unpopular, no friends, and I was desperate for a girlfriend. I wanted a girlfriend so bad. And I wasnâ€™t even horny. I was fantasizing about someday getting to buy a girl a locket. Like, thatâ€™s how wholesome I was. So, I knew I could never date a girl at my own school. So I had a plan. If I could just meet girls in other school districts, it could take weeks for them to find out about me. So I got a bunch of art supplies that I had in my basement, because I was actually really into drawing at the time. I actually went to college to be a painter, thatâ€™s why I do comedy for a living. So I got these art supplies, and I really did this. Iâ€™m not even joking. I really made a bunch of handdrawn homemade posters that really did say, â€œChildrenâ€™s Dating Service.â€ Oh! And, my phone number. And my mom walked in on me making these posters, and I swear to God, she said, â€œOh, good idea! Want me to help you put these up?â€ That is poor parenting. I am convinced to this day that the only reason I wasnâ€™t molested is that every pervert in my town thought that this was the laziest police sting theyâ€™d ever seen.
Thanks a lot, guys. Iâ€™m Dave. Weâ€™ve gotâ€¦ weâ€™ve got such a great show for you. This next comic, he is one of my favorite comics in the world. You may have seen him in the movie Big Time Adolescence. Letâ€™s give a big hand, everybody, for Joey Gay!
[cheers and applause]
Whatâ€™s up, fuckers, how are you? Oh no, thatâ€™s not going to work! How are you? [Joey] Thatâ€™s right! It was fine. Itâ€™s great to be here. My name is Joey Gay, GAY. I grew up in Brooklyn. That shit was not cool. Other children beat the shit out of me because my last name is Gay. Two weeks ago I found out my last name is from the Champagne region in France. I know, it got gayer! Which seems weird in this late stage in the game. And itâ€™s supposed to be pronounced, â€œGhee.â€ Right? But I still live in Brooklyn, I donâ€™t have the time or the balls to correct people. Like, â€œOh, no, sir, thatâ€™s pronounced â€˜Gheeâ€™.â€ People in Brooklyn are dickheads, theyâ€™ll be like, â€œOh, I know, I got a cousin whoâ€™s â€˜ghee,â€™ he sucks â€˜cooks.'â€ So happy to be here tonight. I had a heart attack recently. They wheeled me into the hospital. The doctor came out and the first thing he said to me was, â€œSir, we found drugs in your system.â€ I was like, â€œAh, Doctor, I put the drugs in my system. Letâ€™s move on to the heart attack. Thatâ€™s the part I donâ€™t know about.â€ He wanted to be a dick, he wanted to keep going, Heâ€™s like, â€œAbout the drugsâ€¦â€ I was like, â€œFuck this guy, Iâ€™m going to flip it on him.â€ I was like, â€œYeah, about the drugs, I want them back!â€ They had to prepare me for surgery. That was scary. While they prepared me for surgery, they shaved down here, but only half. Only the right half, the top and one of the twins, the lowhanging one. Yeah! And then, they started surgery by going in through my wrist. Yes! I was like, â€œHey, what the fuck?â€ He was like, â€œWell, in case this doesnâ€™t work, weâ€™ll go in.â€ I was like, â€œCouldnâ€™t you have waited? Look at this!â€ Do you know what itâ€™s like to be laying naked, on the edge of death, surrounded by strangers, thinking, â€œGod! Let me live so I can shave this other nut. Donâ€™t send me to the afterlife looking like this, Lord.â€ Having a heart attack is a fuckedup thing. After that, youâ€™ve got to change stuff. You got to change stuff. I had to start exercising, I had to give up cigarettes. Oh my God! Do I miss cigarettes. Cigarettes are the single greatest vice on the planet. If you donâ€™t believe me, allow me to explain. People used to go home at night to smoke, and they would put on their smoking jacket. It is a vice that is so good, it had apparel. You would go into your home and put on a silk jacket like some sort of tobacco pimp. I wish other vices had apparel, too. Right? So then when you showed up at the bar on Friday night and you saw your friends, you would know exactly what type of bullshit you were in for that night. People would be like, â€œHey, thereâ€™s Larry!â€ You would be like, â€œDonâ€™t wave at Larry.â€ â€œWhy not?â€ â€œLarry is wearing his crack helmet. Larry is going to be an asshole tonight! Borrowing money, chewing on his face.â€ Iâ€™m getting older and finding out in weird fucking ways. I found out I was getting old at my bodega. Last year, when they gave me my change, they were like, â€œThank you, my dude.â€ Now they go, â€œThank you, sir.â€ Hey! Fuck you! Ease off on that â€œsirâ€ shit. Whenever some young motherfucker gives me that â€œsirâ€ shit, I have something for them, though. When they go, â€œThank you, sir.â€ I go, â€œI welcome your thanks, young squire!â€ See, that puts an end to that â€œsirâ€ shit 99% of the time. But the asshole at my bodega on the corner likes to spend his weekends at the Renaissance festival. Yeah, so now every time I come in, heâ€™s like, â€œMy liege!â€ I like Los Angeles. Itâ€™s crazy though. I was out here on Hollywood Boulevard, it reminds me of my hometown, New York. Listen, if you are from New York or L.A., you have a superpower that other people in the country donâ€™t. And that is you can ignore more crazyâ€¦ than anybody else on the planet. You could be standing on a corner waiting for the light to change. A stranger could walk up next to you. He could be holding a severed human head, wearing no pants, no underwear, rockhard dick out to here! If youâ€™re from a town like ours, you just go, â€œNot my head, not my dick, not my business.â€
Thank you very much. I have enjoyed this more than you have.
[cheers and applause]
It is my pleasure to bring to the stage a man youâ€™ve seen here on Netflix on the show Love. Ladies and gentlemen, a big round of applause for Mr. Jordan Rock.
[cheers and applause]
Ah, you guys can make more noise than that. Whatâ€™s good, L.A.? Make some noise!
[cheers and applause]
Nice. Nice. So, 2022, how we feeling about it?
[scattered clamoring]
Not even a clap, alright. I know, right? Weâ€™re feeling it out still. I donâ€™t know, man. Not that itâ€™s a bad year, we just had two bad years back to back. Right? Like 2020, 2021â€¦ 2021 started good. They let us outside. They were like, â€œGo, be out there!â€ They told us to take the masks off, we threw them in the air like it was graduation. And then they were like, â€œPut them back on!â€ And we were like, â€œNo, thatâ€™s not how this shit works. Alright? No! You reneging right now. Nah.â€ The CDC was acting like your parents after they gave you too much freedom. You felt that, right? CDC was on TV like, â€œBring the car back right now, alright?â€ You were like, â€œNo, you said I could be out though!â€ â€œYeah, I said you could be out, I didnâ€™t say you could be with your friends.â€ That was our life, man. We made it out. What else happened in 2021? We got that new president. How do we feel about him?
[scattered applause]
Ehâ€¦ Iâ€™m not political, I donâ€™t have any political jokes. But I will say this about Joe Biden. I didnâ€™t even know I liked my president tweeting until it stopped. Now Iâ€™m just like, â€œNiggaâ€¦ where you at, bro?â€ Likeâ€¦ What the fuck? Yo, Trump tweeted all the time. Trump tweeted like Kanye, it was like, â€œYo, take this niggaâ€™s phone, bro!â€ But the con was, every time Trump tweeted, it was like, â€œI feel like he about to go to war. I feel likeâ€¦â€ But now we almost there. And Iâ€™m just looking at Joe Biden like, â€œNiggaâ€¦ start an Instagram or something, bro, please! A TikTok! You got to reach Gen Z, man!â€ Speaking of Gen Z, is there any Gen Z in here? Any?
[audience cheering]
Alright, round of applause if you are over the age of 25.
[cheers and applause]
Nice. My people. Round of applause if you are under the age of 25.
[cheers and applause]
Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re all here. Iâ€™ll take it on behalf of everybody over the age of 25 to finally say to everyone under 25: fuck Gen Z! We donâ€™t like you! Iâ€™m a millennial, yo, I thought we were bad. Yeah, we had opinions. No one gave a fuck. Everyone under 25, yâ€™all got opinions and you want everyone to know them, and you want everybody to change for you. Yeah, everyone under the age of 25 is like, â€œI know I just got here in 1997, but youâ€™re doing it wrong, alright? Listen to me, okay? I read a book and wrote a blog, alright? Listen to me. Iâ€™ve never signed a lease, but listen, okay?â€ I hate it, man. Millennials, we were progressive. We did progressive shit, but we didnâ€™t lead like that, you know? It was just like, â€œYo man, why you doing that? That shitâ€™s hard.â€ That was it. â€œYo, why you wearing that? That shitâ€™s dope.â€ Thatâ€™s all we needed. Ask anybody under the age of 25 why theyâ€™re doing anything. Like, â€œHey man, why are you wearing that shirt?â€ â€œClothingâ€™s my outlet.â€ â€œYo, shut the fuck up, please. Please? Please shut up. Please, please, please, please, please.â€ Talking about anybody under the age of 25 with a Twitter account. Fuck you. Alright? Yes, thank you, up top. Thank you, thank you. Yeah, Iâ€™m happy about 2022 that nothing racialâ€™s happened yet. I hate when racial shit happens in the country, like cops shoot an unarmed black man. Go back to work the next day, all your white friends are overcompensating. Yeah, you get it. Youâ€™re Asian, youâ€™re a POC, yeah! Show up the next day, all your white friends in your face like, â€œHey. Do you knowâ€¦ that Black livesâ€¦ matter?â€ And Iâ€™m just looking at them confused, like, â€œYeah, I thought all of that was for you. Iâ€™ve been here, Iâ€™m Black, I matter. Tell your grandpa, please. He makes the laws.â€ I hate it, man. All my white friends overcompensate. All my other friends act like good people. I hate it. I go on Facebook, all my friends turn into activists out of nowhere. Yeah, I read the post, by the end of it Iâ€™m like, â€œBut nigga, I know you. Youâ€™reâ€¦ youâ€™re a piece of shit, man. You curse at your mom. What are you talking about?â€ I hate it. My boys get way too into it. Went on Facebook the other day, my boy was like, â€œIâ€™m about to donate to charity!â€ I was like, â€œWhoa, nigga, you owe me $40, what are you talking about? Fuck this GoFundMe, bro, you donâ€™t know her, alright? I was there for you when you needed it. Break me, nigga.â€ Found out I was a piece of shit in 2020. Not that Iâ€™m a piece of shit, itâ€™s just that I have a selfish set of inner values. I have to answer to God about that when I go, okay? But Iâ€™m still with the shit, I still donâ€™t fuck with racism, systemic racism, police brutality. The police. But at the same time, there are certain things that affect me just as much as the police. There are certain things that happened to me that I think are just as bad as the police, to me. Yâ€™all quiet as shit right now. Yâ€™all are like, â€œWhere the fuck is he going with all these trigger words? Just trigger after trigger after trigger, Iâ€™m triggered.â€ I got yâ€™all, Iâ€™ll make it funny, alright? Here we go. Yâ€™all ready forâ€¦? This is something. Yâ€™all ready for something that I think is just as bad as the police? [woman] Yeah. Alright, here we go. If youâ€™re a woman, and you give a halfass blowjob, you are just as bad as the police to me, okay? You are oppressing me. Youâ€™re stopping me from reaching my full potential. And I know youâ€™re causing that police brutality outside, alright? Because officers with empty nuts donâ€™t shoot unarmed black people, okay? We cannot have these officers in the streets with full nuts and full clips. One of them has to be empty. So ladies, we need you. Every woman in this room. We need you. We need you the most, alright? Next time you suck a dick, alright? Go down there with intent, alright? Justâ€¦ Just energy, commitment, alright? Grab the head right here, okay? This is where all the nerves are. Fuck the shaft, grab the balls, tickle the taint, spit, elbow grease. Iâ€™ll sum it all up. Ladies, if you can, next time you suck a dick, pleaseâ€¦ suck dickâ€¦ like Black lives matter. We need you! White women, we really need you, okay? We really do. You have, uhâ€¦ You have BLM on all your dating profiles. Itâ€™s time to prove it, alright? Iâ€™m Jordan Rock, and with that being said, are you ready for me to bring back the man of the hour? Make some noise for my motherfucking nigga, Pete Davidson, everybody.
[cheers and applause]
Woo! Jordan Rock, everybody. Jordan Rock. Backstage, I was like, welp, Iâ€™m getting canceled. Thank you. Thank you guys all for coming out. One more time for all the comics that you see tonight.
[cheers and applause]
Anyways, this next guy whoâ€™s coming to the stageâ€¦ we celebrated Christmas together in 2018. We were at my momâ€™s house, we were living together at my momâ€™s houseâ€¦ in her basement. And I remember we were looking at each other, and we were like, â€œItâ€™s okay. Our careers are fucking over. Itâ€™s fine. We had fun. Itâ€™s all good.â€ Whoever would have thought we could have done anything, right? This guy now has two numberone albums in a row. Heâ€™s I think one of the biggest names you can get. Please give it up for Machine Gun Kelly, everyone!

[announcer] Please welcome your host, Amy Schumer.
[cheers, applause]
Thank you, wow! Thank you so much! I deserve this, I do. Totally. Please, sit. Please! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, if we didnâ€™t have COVID yet, weâ€™ve got it now. What a way to go. I have not had COVID yet. Who else? Clap if you havenâ€™t had COVID yet. I love how smug everybodyâ€¦ Yeah! And the other people just look at you like, â€œFuck you.â€ But no, sorry, we havenâ€™t had it yet, you guys. Weâ€™re sorryâ€¦ I guess God chooses he who protects. No. Weâ€™re going to get it. Weâ€™re going to get it tonight. So, umâ€¦ I donâ€™t know if you know this, but I had a baby. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Not bad for a year, right? Not bad? Itâ€™s been threeâ€¦ itâ€™s been three years. I still havenâ€™t made a baby book for my son. My momâ€™s really trying to get me to make a baby book. I just canâ€™t do it. She kept, like, serious baby books on all of us. But if you think about a baby book, itâ€™s really just, like, a lot of teeth, and hair, and fingerprints. Itâ€™s really a serial killerâ€™s log. She wrote one milestone down for me that I just saw recently. I couldnâ€™t believe it, that she thought this was good. It was, â€œAt 24 months, Amy can now watch up to three hours of television.â€ This is a milestone she felt she was proud of. My son reaches that milestone daily, so donâ€™t worry about it. People are like, â€œHow much screen time?â€ Iâ€™m like â€œAll screen time. Always.â€ My mom makes scrapbooks for me, which people hear and they go, â€œAw.â€ But she puts every single thing in there. Things that I have tried to avoid. Itâ€™ll be some tabloid like, â€œAmy Schumer: Pregnant, or Just Fat?â€ in the book. Iâ€™m like, â€œDid you think I needed to remember this?â€ You know? Our son, his name is Gene. Yeah, heâ€™s a little cutie. He was named Gene for my husbandâ€™s mother, Jean, was her name. She passed away, which is so sadâ€¦ but to not have a mother-in-law? Iâ€™m sorry! I obviously did something right in a former life, Iâ€™m sorry! So his first nameâ€™s Gene, and then we named him Attell for his middle name, after Dave Attell, the incredible comedian. Yes. Heâ€™s an old family friend of mine. And then my husbandâ€™s last name is Fischer. Which is also why Iâ€™ll never take his last name, because I donâ€™t want to be Amy Fischer. Who, some of you my age know, was the Long Island Lolita who tried to kill her boyfriendâ€™s wife. So anyway! So anyway, we name our son, and then, about a month into being a new mom, not a vulnerable time at all, I realize that we have named our son Gene Attell. Genital. Genital Fissureâ€¦ Anyone else ever fuck up to that extent? Probably not. Probably not. So we immediately changed his middle name. I hope itâ€™s better. We changed it to â€œDingleberry.â€ Is that good? Will that do well in school? My son just saw my lower back tattoo for the first time. Thatâ€™s a fun conversation, right? Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat is that?â€ And I just explained to him â€œYour mom is trash.â€ Okay, okay. I try so hard. Like, you try so hard to be a good parent, and itâ€™s justâ€¦ You donâ€™t get better at being a parent. You just get so used to fucking up. Right? Thatâ€™s really what it is. Itâ€™s just like, you get used to it. Heâ€™s beenâ€¦ Iâ€™ve been showing him Disney movies, thatâ€™s been a lot of fun. Except theyâ€™re all so problematic. If any of you have kids and you watch Disney movies with them, before every Disney movie now, it just says, uh, it says, â€œLook, we fucked up, okay?â€ It says, â€œWe fucked up then, and now, and weâ€™re sorry, and weâ€™re going to just leave this here, but itâ€™s fucked up.â€ And itâ€™s true. And Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are they talking about? Itâ€™s Peter Pan,â€ you know? So we start Peter Pan. All the indigenous people, they showâ€¦ â€œOh-wo-woâ€. Awful. So fucked up. Iâ€™m like, â€œThis isnâ€™t good. What else?â€ All the women in these moviesâ€¦ in Peter Pan, itâ€™s just these mermaids. Remember the mermaids? Theyâ€™re all topless, but long hair. They all speak in a whisper. Theyâ€™re all, â€œOh, Peter. We miss you so much, Peter. Oh, weâ€™re so wet. Weâ€™re mermaids!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYou canâ€™t watch this!â€ Donâ€™t even try to watch Jungle Book, okay? So Iâ€™m like, â€œLetâ€™s scrub forward, letâ€™s see some of the newer ones,â€ I heard Tangled was cute, so we watched Tangled. And itâ€™s about Rapunzel, you know, long blonde hair Rapunzel. And spoiler alert: in this movie, if you cut Rapunzelâ€™s hair, something horrible happens. It turns brown! And that happens! Her hair gets cut, and then she has short, brown hair! Sheâ€™s revolting! But even though sheâ€™s hideous, the prince still finds a way to love her. Isnâ€™t that beautiful? Thatâ€™s what I want my son to grow up with. I have such a bad habit right now when I read him books, which I do, because Iâ€™m a hero. Anytime thereâ€™s like an even vaguely blonde attractive woman in any book, Iâ€™m like, â€œWho does that look like?â€ Like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and Iâ€™m like, â€œGoldilocks, whoâ€¦? Remind you of anyone?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œMommy!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, my God, thank you!â€ Then he sees a bear, heâ€™s like â€œMommy!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOnly when prompted, okay?â€
All right, you guys are such a great crowd, weâ€™re going to have such a fun night together.
[cheers, applause]
This is really an incredible line-up of some of my best friends and my favorite comedians, and weâ€™re all here to vent about our families, so weâ€™re really happy that youâ€™re here to do that with us. So to kick us off, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ron Funches!
[cheers, applause]
Hi! Hi! Thank you! What a fun show, we get to talk about families? I fucking love families. Oh, Iâ€™m doing real well. My family lifeâ€™s going well. I just had my year anniversary with my wife, which is wonderful. Yeah. Itâ€™s the second marriage, so I feel like this oneâ€™s going to stick. I recommend, if youâ€™re in your first marriage, just get that one out of the way. Youâ€™re not even in your final form yet. After my first marriage, I was a little bit worried Iâ€™d be damaged goods and people wouldnâ€™t want me, but itâ€™s kind of the opposite, you know? I knew more about myself, I knew what I liked, what I didnâ€™t like. I know how good my marriage is now because I could base it off of how shitty my first marriage was. And Iâ€™m not one of those comics that like to talk shit about their ex, itâ€™s just that we were married too young. We didnâ€™t really trust each other, didnâ€™t respect each other. She kept tryingâ€¦ I was a little bit bigger then, and she kept trying to dress me in clothes with, like, giant dogs on them all the time. Or just a lot of bright floral patterns and khaki shorts. Just trying to make me look like a Black Gabriel Iglesias. Basically just keeping me real unfuckable. But my wife now, she wants me to be cute! Before I leave the house, she checks the hair. She makes sure Iâ€™m suited and booted. She wants people to want to fuck me! Thatâ€™s a good marriage! Thank you! I didnâ€™t know a marriage could be fun like that! I thought it had to be a constant fight, constant struggle. I didnâ€™t know marriage could just be hanging out, laughing together, watching Seinfeld all day, until you get your dick sucked. When you boil marriage down to that one sentence, I mean, oh, my God, it is beautiful. Especially if you understand how often Iâ€™ve watched Seinfeld all dayâ€¦ without getting my dick sucked. But no longer. Uh-uh. Now I get excited as soon as I hear the theme song. Yeah, as soon as I hear that, â€œBom-buh-bom-bom-bomâ€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOoh, I better go get her scrunchie!â€ A lot of you related to that scrunchie material. You got to be considerate. My wife is a very considerate person, thatâ€™s how we fell in love. Before we met, I had already been married before, I had my son already. And I was like, â€œThis is going to be my focus.â€ But she came into my life and she was such a nice person. She kept asking me the same question over and over and over, until she wormed her way into my heart. And Iâ€™m going to let you know what she asked me in case you need to trap a man. My wife kept asking meâ€¦ if I was drinking enough water. And I was like, â€œWe both know the answer is no.â€ I think the real question here is, â€œWhy the fuck do you care?â€ But it was because she cared about me! She cared about my well-being. And that was off-putting to me, I didnâ€™t like that at first. I was used to these Los Angeles vampire bitches. But she just kept at it. Iâ€™d go up to take her on a date, Iâ€™d pick her up at her house, ring the doorbell, sheâ€™d answer the door, and you know what she would have waiting for me? A bottle of water! If I was lucky enough to get her back to my house and spend the night, Iâ€™d wake up in the morning, turn over, sheâ€™d already be gone. But do you know what would be laying in her place? Bottle of water! One day it just got to me, and I was like, â€œAwâ€¦ no bitch ever cared about my hydration!â€ After my first marriage, I didnâ€™t drink water for five years straight. Nobody said a word. And I was walking around with adult-onset jaundice, it was terrible. One thing I love about my wife is she came in right away, was a great stepmom. Again, Iâ€™m a single father for most of my life. I have a son who was diagnosed with autism when he was two years old. We went through a lot of therapy, seizures, different issues, and Iâ€™m very proud that heâ€™s now a 19-year-old high school graduate.
[cheers, applause]
Working at a grocery store. I worked at a grocery store when I was 19, a little bit before I had him. So Iâ€™m like, â€œAs long as you donâ€™t knock somebody up in the next six months, youâ€™re killing it!â€ Heâ€™s got great discipline, and I donâ€™t know where he got it. Because I never disciplined him. I didnâ€™t know how, especially having a teenager and someone who had autism. I didnâ€™t know what to do, I didnâ€™t know what was teenager-related, I didnâ€™t know what was autism-related. I didnâ€™t know which of these things made him download sixty episodes of The Price Is Right. But I know thatâ€™s not normal. The Price Is Right is a fine show, but it is the same damn show every day! Iâ€™m like, â€œSon, did you need to fill the entire DVR with Price Is Right?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOh, Iâ€™m just trying to keep season stats, Dad.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, so itâ€™s the autism.â€ Carry on. I love watching him become an adult, have his own likes and dislikes. My favorite thing in the world is I share a Spotify account with my son. And at the end of the year, I get that â€œSpotify Wrappedâ€ and I love it. Because I get to find out what an autistic teenager thinks is the hottest song of the year. It turns out my sonâ€™s favorite song of all of last yearâ€¦ this is an honest to God factâ€¦ was just the sound effectâ€¦ of beesâ€¦ buzzing in a meadow. No! Yeah, itâ€™s cute when you donâ€™t live with it. But try coming home to that every day. You canâ€™t even do normal parent stuff. You canâ€™t be like, â€œHey! Can you turn down thisâ€¦ delightful summerâ€™s day?â€ Heâ€™s just like, â€œDad, you donâ€™t understand the music that speaks to my generation! You need to open your mind! Itâ€™s got a good buzz to it.â€
Thank you guys for your time, Iâ€™m Ron Funches.
[cheers, applause]
Hi, Amy!
Hi, Ron!
Bye!
Good job! Bye! How funny is Ron Funches? Youâ€™re such a good crowd. Alright, please keep that energy going. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ms. Jaye McBride!
[cheers, applause]
Alright! Thank you so much. Man, it is great to be out without a mask on. Right? Alright. I actually had a guy refuse to have sex with me unless I wore a mask. I know, and this is way before the pandemic. It wasnâ€™t even a medical mask, it was like a Spider-Man mask. Heâ€™s like, â€œI got you now, Web Slinger!â€ Whichâ€¦ Well, you take what you can get, right? I have a tough time dating. Yâ€™all know Iâ€™m trans, right? Yâ€™all figure that out already, you bunch ofâ€¦? Look at you, you bunch of L.A. detectives. Yâ€™all are like, â€œOf course I know. Iâ€™m from Kansas, not from Mars, I can tell.â€ The weird thing is, I wasnâ€™t trans before I got the vaccine. Fucking Johnson & Johnson, I swear to God. One shot, my ass. No, I actually transitioned 15 years ago, which, oh, no, thank you, butâ€¦ No, donâ€™t clap, donâ€™t clap. I only did it to compete in the Olympics. Iâ€™m no hero. But man. And I knew early on, like I knew real early, when I was like, five, we took the dog to the vet to get fixed, and I was in the back yelling, â€œDo me next!â€ I was raised Irish Catholic too, which made it tough. I know, right? Like hereâ€™s how Irish Catholic I am. My grandmother had ten kids. Yeah, ten. Thatâ€™s a good Irish Catholic woman, right? And she had two miscarriages, so she was pregnant 12 times in 16 years. I know, right? She didnâ€™t have periods, she had commas. Yeah, my grandmother was old-school. Yeah. Like, she was likeâ€¦ She also told me once that she didnâ€™t believe in gay people. Like, thatâ€™s what she said, â€œI donâ€™t believe in gay people.â€ Which is weird because she did believe in angels, leprechauns, and Sasquatch. I have an uncle whoâ€™s a priest. Yeah, he said to me once, he said, â€œI donâ€™t ever want to watch you do comedy because I donâ€™t want to listen to you talk about having sex with a man.â€ So I just send him pictures.
[cheers, applause]
That wasnâ€™t his reaction. No, people always say, â€œIf you were raised more religiously, you would have turned out normal.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHoney, I was an altar boy. And I loved it!â€ Oh, no, the priest never touched me, or hit on me, or molested me. And I tried everything, too. I was like, â€œFather, this confessional is too hot for pants!â€ My dad thought that being an altar boy would turn me into a man, but apparently sitting around in a dress drinking wine all day didnâ€™t do the job! Yeah, my dad wasnâ€™t a fan of this whole thing. I remember when I was little, I was like, â€œDad, what do you call a little boy who wants to be a little girl?â€ He said, â€œI donâ€™t know, but theyâ€™re definitely not getting any ice cream!â€ Terrible, right? Donâ€™t worry, he dies in the end. Wow, some of you either love dark humor or you hate your dad. I donâ€™t know. My dad died around Christmas time, which was tough. I didnâ€™t know what to ask for because I already got what I wanted! So Iâ€™m in therapy. Alright, thank you, I guess. No, Iâ€™m in therapy. Iâ€™ve really been talking to my therapist a lot about my mom. My mom passed away andâ€¦ I know, youâ€™re like, â€œAw, dead mom, dead dad. What next, Little Orphan Tranny?â€ We are talking about my mom a lot. Like, my mom was great. My therapist said I should talk to my mom every day, you know, which seems a littleâ€¦ crazy, so I just talk to the mannequin in the attic I dressed up in her clothes. But she was great. My mom was great. She was like this Martha Stewart-type, you know? A convicted felon who could cook. And when I first came out to her as trans, it sort of took her a while. She said she had to pray to God after I told her. Which makes sense, because if youâ€™re a middle-aged white woman and you donâ€™t like something, you talk to the manager. Hit a little close to home, huh, L.A.? No, I still try to please my mom. After she passed away, I thought, Iâ€™m going to do something nice. So I decided I was going to spread her remains in her favorite place: the town I grew up in, itâ€™s a town called Westport, New York. Itâ€™s in the Adirondack Mountains, itâ€™s on Lake Champlain. Donâ€™t clap, youâ€™re not from there. But itâ€™s beautiful. I drive six hours and start to spread her remains. Someone comes running out and says, â€œStop, you canâ€™t do that!â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy not?â€ He said, â€œYou have to cremate her first.â€ So then I had to put her back in the garbage bag. So sheâ€™s at her second favorite place. Behind an Arbyâ€™s. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m late tonight, andâ€¦ I have three brothers. It was weird with three brothers, like our parents were kind of cheap, so when they ran the bath water, they did it once. And we all had to share, one right after another, right? Oh, itâ€™s the worst. If youâ€™re the last one, itâ€™s like the Hudson River at low tide. And Iâ€™m in there, and Iâ€™m looking down one day, and Iâ€™m thinking, â€œThis is disgusting. Iâ€™m 32 years oldâ€¦â€ I did have a brother disown me when he found out I was trans, but itâ€™s fine. I try to take the high road, you know? When I heard he and his wife had a child, I sent the nicest greeting card. It said, â€œCongratulations, itâ€™s a boyâ€¦ for now!â€
Thank you guys so much.
[cheers, applause]
Jaye McBride, let her hear it! Alright! I donâ€™t know if you guys are familiar with the Oscars, but I justâ€¦ Yeah, I got to co-host the Oscars this year. Yes. Andâ€¦ You know, we all saw that sad thing that happened. Jessica Chastain won. No, it was really sad, the Will Smith thing where he hit Chris Rock. It was a total bummer, shocking, but you know, I guess itâ€™s like, he got in one little fight and his mom got scared, I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know! I got censored that night. There were a couple things that I wasnâ€™t allowed to say. So I think Iâ€™ll tell you guys right now.
[audience cheers]
Yeah, you guys seem like bad people. Okay. I donâ€™t know why they said no. So my husband was going down on me, or as he calls it, â€œSquid Game.â€ Soâ€¦ heâ€™s in my Nightmare Alleyâ€¦ my House of Gucci. And I say, â€œCâ€™mon, Câ€™mon,â€ you know? He goes â€œtick, tickâ€¦ BOOM!â€ He â€œBells fast,â€ I say, â€œGet off my Dune,â€ and thatâ€™s how our son was born. What do you think?
[cheers, applause]
Alright, letâ€™s keep it moving right along. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Christina P!
[cheers, applause]
Oh! Hello, Los Angeles. Woohoo! Oh, man, I moved to Texas. I was in Angelino for 44 years, Iâ€™m sorry, I know. I feel guilty being here. I feel like a divorced dadâ€¦ thatâ€™s come back to visit their kid. Iâ€™m like, â€œListen, I love your mom, but I had to go, okay?â€ You donâ€™t understand, man, they were wearing N-95s in their cars alone and shit, It was really fuckingâ€¦ But yeah, soâ€¦ You know, Iâ€™m aâ€¦ Iâ€™m a solidly middle-aged mom now. Yeah, thank you. And like, everything makes me fat. Everything. And I live in Texas, so the only thing I can eat with no calories is Klonopin. And I love it, I just dip it in barbecue sauce! [smacks lips] And I like the South, theyâ€™re very nice, theyâ€™re very cool, but everything moves at a glacial pace. They have zero sense of urgency. And then I realized, I was like, â€œWell, what am I hurrying to? Thereâ€™s nothing to do.â€ What, am I hurrying to get to Chick-fil-A before it closes on Sunday? You guys know why Chick-fil-A is closed on Sunday, right? Becauseâ€¦ Well, thatâ€™s the day they grind up all the gay people to makeâ€¦ the batter for the biscuits. Theyâ€™re so good! Ha ha! And they take homosexual semen, and thatâ€™s what that orange sauceâ€¦ Delicious. The Christians are on this side, theyâ€™re notâ€¦ Alright. Okay, so, Iâ€™ve been married for 17 years, and oh, thank you. And he still pees on me in the shower, so thatâ€™sâ€¦ cool. And he does this super creepy thing where he likes to make eye contact with me while he does it. And he pretends like he doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening. Heâ€™ll stare at me, and heâ€™ll be like, â€œDo you smell that? Do you smell that? Smells bad. Can you smell that?â€ Iâ€™m like â€œNo, I just had COVID.â€ COVID blessings. So, I have a three-year-old boy, and a six-year-old boy, and a husband, so I see more dicks than an episode of Euphoria on any given day. Donâ€™t you love Euphoria? Thatâ€™s such a middle-aged mom show. I know. Euphoria is Cobra Kai with titties. It is the best. So people are always telling me, theyâ€™re like, â€œYou know, Christina, those kids, they grow up so fast.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œDo they? What are you feeding yours? Because I would like to speed this shit up.â€ Okay? And itâ€™s not the kids that bum me out, itâ€™s the parenting world. Because thereâ€™s way too many demands on parents. Like now, I got to dress my children in organic cotton gender-neutral clothing. I have to find them inclusive, non-ableist toys. And you got to breastfeed until theyâ€™re in college, did you know that? Oh, yeah. There was a woman in my â€œMommy and Meâ€ class breastfeeding her four-year-old. Iâ€™m sorry, 208-week-old, yes? Will McKenzie be weaned in time for prom? My parents didnâ€™t do shit. Right? Parents before never had to do anything. My parents didnâ€™t even put a seatbelt on me in the car. I used to ride in the back of my dadâ€™s pick-up truckâ€¦ in a lawn chair, and then I would hang out trying to tag street signs. And then when the cops pulled you over, heâ€™d let you play with his gun. But today, oh, my God, the parents, theyâ€™re all freaked out. You ever see these helicopter moms? These helicopter moms? Yeah. So, I go to the park, and thatâ€™s â€œme time,â€ you know? I have a beer, I chill out. You just let them run, thatâ€™s what the park is for!
[man] Yeah!
Right. Then I see these poor helicopter moms, and look, I get it. I was like that after my first kid. You ever see that mom thatâ€™s trying to do it right? Youâ€™re just trying to do it right, and sheâ€™s narrating everything the kid is doing, as theyâ€™re doing it. â€œOkay. Good job, Cooper! Good job, Cooper! Yeah, Cooper, now put your foot on the ladder, Cooper. Good job! Put your foot on the ladder, Cooper, now run across, Cooper, run across, Cooper, run across, Cooper, good job, Cooper, good job, Cooper! Would you like a snack, Cooper? Cooper, snack? Snack? Cooper, Cooper? How about a cheese stick? How about a cheese stick? Water? Water? Water? Cooper? Cooper? Snack? Snack? Snack? Snack?â€ Oh! Oh! Oh, until finally, little Cooper couldnâ€™t take it anymore, and he goes, â€œI need space!â€ I almost high-fived that kid, I was like, â€œLook at you, asserting boundaries with your mother! That took me ten years in psychotherapy! You just figured that out?â€ And stop telling kids to be themselves. Jesus Christ. Stop telling kids to be themselves. They already know how. They know how. Just ask my sons. Theyâ€™re probably naked right now on the driveway, wearing nothing but cowboy boots. And the other day, my son runs up to me, the older one, the six-year-old, he runs up to me naked, and he goes, â€œHey, Mom, hey, Mom! You want a surprise?â€ And then he turned around and he farted right at me. Timing was impeccable. The three-year-old sees that, and does the exact same thing: â€œHey, Mom! Mom! Mom! You want to see aâ€¦ Do you want to see a surprise?â€ Turns around, spreads his cheeks apart, and goes, â€œSmell my ass! Smell it!â€ Yeah, Iâ€™d say you have a pretty good idea of who you are when you aim your asshole at somebody, right? And stop telling me that gender isnâ€™t real. Stop it, stop it. Stop telling me that â€œgender is a social construct.â€ People who say that have not raised boys. Oh, girls and boys are the same? Oh, really? Really! Youâ€™ve seen a six-year-old girl piss out a campfire? And then be super pumped about it? Like, â€œOh my God, do you smell that? Can you smell that? Smells bad.â€ Good to see that disgusting is genetic. Alright, thank you guys so much. Thank you so much.
[cheers, applause]
This is a real treat. I get to bring out my very best friend in the whole world. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ms. Rachel Feinstein! [cheers, applause] Thank you! Thank you, guys, youâ€™re nice to me here. Itâ€™s been a weird week. My family was visiting, itâ€™s a lot with my mom. I donâ€™t know if anybody has a parent like this. My mother has no boundaries. Every time Iâ€™m alone with her, she tells me something I truly never wanted to know. Sheâ€™ll be like, â€œFine, there was a year when I considered leaving your father.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t want to know that.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI called it my dark year.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYou title years of your life? You teach low-impact aerobics. You donâ€™t know darkness.â€ Iâ€™m the same way, but with strangers. Like, Iâ€™ll overshare with any stranger. Iâ€™ll be in line at a CVS, somebody smiles at me, and Iâ€™ll be like, â€œI guess I never felt seen by my father? I mean, I knew he loved me, butâ€¦â€ That was my worst fear when I had a kid, like, â€œWhat if I donâ€™t connect to her?â€ Because you hear that happens. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ll tell everyone!â€ Iâ€™ll be at a barbecue, and somebody will be like, â€œSheâ€™s so cute,â€ and Iâ€™ll be like, â€œIsnâ€™t it crazy, but I donâ€™t love her. Like, I feel nothingâ€¦ but a vague sense of resentment!â€ Then, when I did love her, I started announcing it to everyone. I was like, â€œWe love her!â€ My brotherâ€™s like, â€œYou shouldnâ€™t say that. Most people assume you love your own kids. Itâ€™s kind of alarming, actually.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s fair feedback.â€ Sheâ€™s a toddler. Sheâ€™s at that age. Sheâ€™s two years old. She just empties every room. She just turns it out like sheâ€™s looking for coke, justâ€¦ like she has 24 hours to leave the country before a drug dealer shoots her in the face. My husbandâ€™s a fireman. I mean, I think heâ€™s a fireman. Thank you. He could just be a stripper with a fireman costume. But this is my life now. I just have to go to these Staten Island FDNY dinner dances and heâ€™ll just deposit me at a shrimp station somewhere. Iâ€™m always the only Jew. All the women are named Gina. Thereâ€™s just like a sea of Ginas. Just rows of hoisted tan racks and shimmering crucifixes. The menâ€¦ the way they congratulated us, the other firemen, when we had a baby was terrifying. Theyâ€™d be like, â€œBeautiful thing right there, huh? Tiny baby girl. You got to cherish her now, alright? While sheâ€™s young.â€ Why does this feel like an active threat, somehow? â€œYou know what? At the end of the day itâ€™s about family. Alright? Remember that. Itâ€™s about family.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy do I feel like Iâ€™m about to get offed on The Sopranos whenever you guys greet us?â€ They always sound like theyâ€™re about to admit something they canâ€™t hold in any longer. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œYou know what? The days are long, the years are short, alright? You got to cherish her right now. Killed my first wife Diane.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t think you meant to say that out loud, Dino.â€ â€œDiane went fast, too. You know? I watched the light go out in her eyes, alright? Everybodyâ€™s good! Everybodyâ€™s safe. Things are good!â€ But thatâ€™s my type. Your type is your type. You canâ€™t change your type. I just like a thick-necked, ignorant-looking man. Thatâ€™s what I like! I like a guy that looks like heâ€™d say, â€œFollow the moneyâ€ when heâ€™s talking about the vaccine. The guys are generally named Vinny, thereâ€™s an occasional Dino. But one of the Vinnies came up toâ€¦ One of the Vinnies came up to us, he goes, â€œYou got to take her to Disney, though. Thatâ€™s the real family experience. You got to take her to EPCOT.â€ Then he goes, â€œThatâ€™s the real Japan, at EPCOT, you know?â€ â€œThatâ€™s like, legit Japan.â€ With no irony whatsoever. Heâ€™s like, â€œPeople think you got to spend all this cash, and fly all the way to Japan, but itâ€™s a fucking scam.â€ He referred to traveling the world as a scam somehow, and EPCOT as reality. That was real life in Vinnyâ€™s mind. But yeah, I asked my mom, â€œWhat was I like when I was my daughterâ€™s age?â€ She can never think of anything good to say about me. Sheâ€™ll always be like, â€œYou know, you ate very fast.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s the detail you pull out?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWell, you ate at a rapid pace. You choked on a chicken bone once, I do remember that. You were a greedy eater. There was a certain rampant quality to your eating and we didnâ€™t feel safe.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThank you, this was real helpful, Iâ€™ll circle back with you.â€ And a lot of the other â€œfirewivesâ€â€¦ Thatâ€™s not a term, theyâ€™ve actually asked me to stop saying thatâ€¦ â€œBadge banger,â€ I prefer that. I identify as a badge banger. Though, a lot of the other womenâ€¦ a lot of the people I know do this. Theyâ€™ll post these long monologues about how fantastic their marriages are on Instagram. Do you know people that do this? I donâ€™t understand the instinct to drag your husband out to a pumpkin patch somewhere. The guyâ€™s bloated and hung over. Heâ€™s completely confused. He has no idea why heâ€™s in matching flannels with his entire extended family. And theyâ€™ll be like, â€œVinny, you challenge me every single day. Every day with you is like a beautiful, challenging journey. You have truly made me question everything I ever thought was possible in this non-stop learning voyage weâ€™re all on together.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œVinny is on PornHub right now. What the fuck has he made you question?â€ The last time I saw him, he was so drunk, he was wet. Just dripping. Also, my husband never takes pictures of me, he always claims thereâ€™s not enough room on his phone. Iâ€™m like, â€œItâ€™s not a storage issue.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œThereâ€™s not enough room on my phone!â€ The one picture he took of me at our wedding, I was eating. I had a sandwich falling out of the corner of my mouth. It was the most slovenly, disgraceful moment. Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s the picture you take?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWell, it was like, the essence of you, you know? Youâ€™re a greedy eater.â€
Alright, you guys, thank you so much.
[cheers, applause]
Rachel Feinstein, let her hear it! These comedians are my best friends, including this one. Heâ€™s just one of my absolute favorite comics. And you know him as Mr. Chris DiStefano!
[cheers, applause]
Great job, Amy. Oh! Hello! Hello, hello, how you doing? You feel good? You look good? This is what it is, dude. Itâ€™s the parenting show. I feel like nobody in here even has kids, right? Itâ€™s L.A., who hasâ€¦? Like eight people. You have kids, dude? Yeah. You look like you have long COVID. Youâ€™re just like sitting there breathâ€¦ I could tell. I knew you had kids. I saw you in the back, I was like, â€œThis guy looks like heâ€™s dying!â€ And yeah. I got kids. I got two little girls. My daughters are Puerto Rican. You know what I mean? So, diverse? Iâ€™m a great white. You know? So, this great white man, I have these little Latina children and they donâ€™t speak English, thatâ€™s the thing. My kids, especially my older one, she just doesnâ€™tâ€¦ They just speak Spanish. The mom is always justâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to watch Encanto to talk to my fucking kids. And I canâ€™tâ€¦ you know, which is great! I want them to learn different languages, but Papi only speaks English, you know? But I think the thing is, with having kids, like I donâ€™t have a lot of time or energy to like, think about a lot of stuff. Like, I had to go to Portland. You know what I mean? Whatever, that city. I love this country. I bleed red, white, and blue, but fucking Portland? You know? I meanâ€¦ Those people, itâ€™s just, itâ€™s too much. Like theyâ€™re very passive aggressive, very woke, and I was just in there, and theyâ€™re just looking at you, judging you. And I was in there two weeks ago. Two weeks ago! I had to go in there. I went to a coffee shop, and I didnâ€™t know that you still had to wear a mask because I was like, itâ€™s present-day America, and you know, the baristaâ€™s just like this, sheâ€™s going like this. She keeps doing this. I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing.â€ Like, sheâ€™s just going like that. I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know sign language. Iâ€™m sorry, I should be better, Iâ€™m a white piece of shit. I know, Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m not anti-sign. What do you want me to do?â€ And she just wasnâ€™t talking, she just kept going like this. I was like, â€œWhat are you trying to tell me, lady? Just use your words!â€ And then she was like, â€œYou need to put on a mask!â€ I was like, â€œOh, okay. You should have just said that!â€ So I was like, â€œOkay.â€ And Iâ€™m just politely putting on a mask, and I was like â€œIâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m from New York, andâ€¦ we donâ€™t have the masks there anymore.â€ And she was like, â€œWell, here in Portland, we still take COVID very seriously.â€ I was like, â€œYou seem like a fun person. You really do. You just seem like a real ball of laughs.â€ And so I proceed to order my drink. I was like, â€œCan I have a small iced coffee, black?â€ She was like, â€œExcuse me?â€ I was like, â€œCan you not hear me through the mask?â€ I was like, â€œCan I have a small iced coffee, black?â€ She was like, â€œDo you mean a small iced coffee with no cream?â€ I was like, â€œIsnâ€™t that the same as a small iced coffee, black?â€ She was like, â€œAfter what the African-American communityâ€™s been through these last two years, I think you need to do a better job ordering your coffees.â€ I was like, â€œIâ€™d rather be beheaded by ISIS than have to talk to you for one more second.â€ So I ripped that mask off, I walked right out of that coffee shop, I walked two blocks down to another coffee shop, walked right in, and said, â€œCan I have a small iced coffee with no cream?â€ Because I am such a little pussy. But you knowâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s what it is. People are justâ€¦ Everyoneâ€™s going a little nuts. Everyoneâ€™s just a little off. You know what Iâ€™m saying? Theyâ€™re just a little off lately. Like I had to put my dog down. Listen, he lived a good life. Eighteen years. Eighteen years, my dog. Little Larry. Larry was his name. Eighteen years old, but he was one of those dogs. He was dying for like the past 16 years. Every time Iâ€™d go visit my motherâ€¦ she had the dogâ€¦ another piece of his body was being biopsied, an eye didnâ€™t work, his head was turned over, he was always bleeding. He looks like heâ€™s fighting in the Civil War. Somebody needs to put this dog down. It was clear this dog wanted to die. And I would just go visit my mom, and try, like, â€œMom, we need to put the dog down.â€ Sheâ€™d be like, â€œJesus hasnâ€™t called him yet.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, heâ€™s calling me to tell youâ€¦ Iâ€™m telling you, the dog wants to die so bad.â€ I would come over with a fistful of bakerâ€™s chocolate. Iâ€™d just be like, â€œWho wants death by chocolate, Larry? Come on. Just eat it, itâ€™s a great way to go out.â€ And so finally, one day I go visit my mom, and the dogâ€™s dying. I mean, Larryâ€™s pretty much dead on the floor. And Iâ€™m just like, â€œLetâ€™s go take the dog to the vet and just put it out of its misery.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re right, letâ€™s go.â€ And it was 12 oâ€™clock, it was midnight, and I was fucking starving. So weâ€™re driving to the vet, and I see a Wendyâ€™s out of the corner of my eye. I was like, â€œMom, real quick, letâ€™s go. Iâ€™ll go to Wendyâ€™s real quick. Iâ€™ll get whatever you want,â€ and sheâ€™s like, â€œNo, letâ€™s go to the vet!â€ I was like, â€œFine, Iâ€™ll just starve then!â€ I was like a disgruntled fucking teenager. Iâ€™m 37. So, we get to the vet, and the vet is so nice. Sheâ€™s like the nicest lady ever. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWe did our tests on little Larry, and we do see that heâ€™s at the end of his life, and weâ€™re just going to put a little prick in his little paw, and the medicineâ€™s going to go through in 30 seconds. Itâ€™s going to be 30 seconds. His little heartâ€™s going to stop, but heâ€™s going to go to Heaven with all the other dogs, and Cruella, and everyoneâ€™s up there, and heâ€™s going to be fine, heâ€™s going to be out of pain, and this is the right thing.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, fine.â€ Because in my head, Iâ€™m like, â€œ30 seconds. By the time we do the paperwork, everything will be good. You know, itâ€™s 12:30, Wendyâ€™s does close at 2:00.â€ And listen, itâ€™s what it is. This is a 100% true story. So, the medicineâ€™s going through, just like she said. Little prick in his paw, itâ€™s going like a roller coaster, itâ€™s going to hit his little body, stop his little heart, thirty seconds. And listen, weâ€™re all upset. Iâ€™m upset, my momâ€™s upset, and Iâ€™m just comforting her. Comforting my mom, sheâ€™s crying. Iâ€™m like, â€œMom, this is fine.â€ We get down to 15 seconds, Iâ€™m like, â€œWe are halfway there, Mom. We are halfway there.â€ We get to five, I started counting out loud. I was like, â€œFive, four, three, two, one! Itâ€™s a celebration!â€ And Larryâ€™s still alive. Heâ€™s just still alive. And Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, that happens,â€ but as time is going on, seconds are going by, Larry looks like heâ€™s getting more energy, like heâ€™s getting color back that he never had, his fur used to be gray, now itâ€™s getting that nice orange tint, heâ€™s standing up on his legs once again. I was like, â€œWow, Larry looks fucking good right now. Whatâ€™s happening?â€ Five minutes go by, and finally I say to the vet, â€œIs there a problem?â€ She goes, â€œAbsolutely.â€ I was like, â€œOh, okay.â€ She goes outside, comes back a minute later. She goes, â€œI am so sorry.â€ She was like, â€œI hired a new vet tech, and the vet tech accidentally gave your dog electrolytes because the dog next door to you was dehydrated and we mixed up the medication.â€ She goes, â€œBut donâ€™t worry, I have the right medication right here. Heâ€™ll be dead in a second.â€ I swear to God, as soon as she put the right medicine in, he died immediately. It was like somebody had a sniper rifle at the top of the fucking room and just shot him in the head. Rolled over, Xs over his eyes, soul gone to heaven, I had a Baconator in my hand at 1:59.
It was fucking fantastic. Alright, guys, thank you.
[cheers, applause]
You guys are the best. You really are such a great crowd. Everyoneâ€™s talking about you backstage. Everybody loves you. We want to make it official. We want to commit. Alright. This comedian is undeniably hilarious and I love him so much. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Lil Rel Howery!
[cheers, applause]
Yeah! What up? Netflix is a fucking joke. I got a whole jeanâ€¦ Look, let me tell you something, Iâ€™m showing my age now. Iâ€™m in my 40s, and this is what 40-year-olds do, they like, match a bunch of shit that donâ€™t make no fucking sense. I got a whole jean suit on with a cowboy hat. This is a dad outfit for real. Iâ€™m the cool dad! You know who the fuck this is. Man, I got a 13, 12-year-old, and a five-year-old. I know, man. Like, fuck! You know whatâ€™s funny? Like when I was a younger parent, I tried to do all the things the right way. Now I donâ€™t really give a fuck no more. You know what Iâ€™m saying? My five-year-old, we went to one of those jumpy things, he peed in that shit. I was like, â€œOh shit, letâ€™s just go.â€ You know what I mean? I ainâ€™tâ€¦ I ainâ€™t changing, we just walking the fuck out of here. He was leaking the whole time. Nobody seen shit. â€œCome on, yâ€™all!â€ Damn! Hate being a fucking new dad again. Carrying their fucking car seat. People downplay that. Nobody realizes how heavy it is to carry a human being with one fucking arm. Thatâ€™s stupid! I donâ€™t give a shit, as long as they strapped in, Iâ€™m going to carry that shit the best way I can. If you upside down, fuck it. Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck it.â€ No, I canâ€™t go to jail! He good, heâ€™s strapped in! As long as he donâ€™t fall out, we good! My daughterâ€™s 13, sheâ€™s a fucking teenager now. She got the period. Thatâ€™s right, it happened with me. I was hopingâ€¦ I was like, â€œDamn, you got to be with me? Shit.â€ Because Iâ€™m a divorced dad, so like, it was my time, and Iâ€™m like, â€œWait a minute, why the fuckâ€¦? I ainâ€™t ready for this.â€ You know what I mean? I tried my best, but I didnâ€™t know what to get. I ainâ€™t going to lie to you. I went to the store and got everything. I didnâ€™t know what the fuck to get. That lady was ringing me up like, â€œYou got a shelter or something? What you got all these different sizes for? What the fuck you got going on, sir? What the fuck you got going on, sir?â€ I ainâ€™t fucking know. Iâ€™m like, â€œLet me get theâ€¦ the pad that absorb the most.â€ Man, we stupid, thatâ€™s what we think, right? We think, â€œGet the shit that absorb the most.â€ And when I put all this shit on the table, she like, â€œUh, Dad, this is for Grandma, I donâ€™t know what the fuckâ€¦ you think Iâ€™ve got going on. Iâ€™m 13, sir.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t want the one that absorb the most?â€ Like my son was there with me, and he was confused, too. We was looking at this shit, and I took everything out of the box, he playing with the shitâ€¦ â€œPut this shit down, stop playing, boy!â€ Ainâ€™t no fucking lightsaber. But he was like, â€œDad, you know something? I would want the grandma one.â€ And I thought about that. Thatâ€™s how little boys fucking think, right? Little girls, like, yâ€™all donâ€™t want nobody to know youâ€™re on your period. You want something to hide that shit. Little boys ainâ€™t shit. If little boys had periods, theyâ€™d want everybody to know they had the fattest shit here. â€œYeah, Iâ€™m on my period, what the fuck you talking about? Yâ€™all need to take me home, I canâ€™t go to school today, Iâ€™m on my period! Iâ€™m sleepy, Iâ€™m hungry, Iâ€™m tired, I canâ€™t focus. Iâ€™m fucked up!â€ Learning too much about women because Iâ€™ve got a fucking 13-year-old. We go bra shopping and shit. I didnâ€™t realize it was about yâ€™allâ€™s backs. Fellas, for a long time, you thought it was about the titty meat, nope! That numberâ€™s about how big their fucking backs is, soâ€¦ if you see a Double D out here, it ainâ€™t about the titties, she got a big-ass back. Iâ€™m just being honest. If you ainâ€™t know. It was weird, too, I forget I was doing a stand-up show. You start thinking about real shit, like â€œGoddamn, I got to figure this Legoland situation out.â€ Fuck, you got a 13, 12, and 5-year-old, the 5-year-old canâ€™t get on shit. And that means I canâ€™t get on shit. They get to have fun, like the 13 and 12-year-old, they get to have a good-ass time. Iâ€™m watching this motherfucker. Iâ€™m sorry, thatâ€™s my kid, butâ€¦ Doing some regular shit, some little bridge, some dumb car thatâ€™s slow as fuck. They do all the, â€œDad, we got on the roller coaster!â€ â€œShut the fuck up! Fuck yâ€™all.â€ Yeah, thatâ€™s real. But my son, my 12-year-old, heâ€™s like my best friend, the oldest, heâ€™sâ€¦ heâ€™s a lot like me, and I love that shit. I love the fact that this brother is like me. Like, if he wasnâ€™t my kid, we would be best fucking friends. If we was the same age, I fucks with him. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t even know how to help him sometimes. You know what I mean? He going through, likeâ€¦ 12-year-old boys, look, it depends, but boys do go through a little weird stinking period, right? Where they just donâ€™t wash their ass well enough. And his mama called me like, â€œYo, you got to talk to him, He doesnâ€™t care. Heâ€™s putting on the same clothes.â€ And itâ€™s hard to talk to your best friend about him stinking. Like, â€œDamn, brother, we got to talk.â€ You try to play the game with them a little bit and shit? Making little jokes, â€œThis is fun, right?â€ [deep sigh] Look, your mama say you have musty balls. Would you just wash that shit so we ainâ€™t got to talk about this shit again, please? I bought you some new socks. Stop wearing the same stinking-ass socks.
Alright, well, thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m done! Thank yâ€™all so much. Iâ€™m Lil Rel, thatâ€™s my time.
[cheers, applause]

[cheers, applause]
[Amy] Aw! Weâ€™re cute! One more time for everybody. Thank you, goodnight! Isnâ€™t it funny that we all have known each other for like years and years? We really donâ€™t know anything. We donâ€™t know anything about each other. We talk about where we grew up on stage, we just donâ€™t pay attention. Right, like I learned so much like, talking to other comics about, â€œYou went to film school?â€ Like, I know nothing. My son wrote a sketch. And it was really funny, and he like kind of dissed me at the same time. Like, â€œDad, I want you to be in the sketch, I want you to do the voice you do in movies when you get really high-pitched and donâ€™t sound how you sound in real life.â€ Like, â€œDamn, what that mean?â€ Wow. Yeah. Itâ€™s so easy!

[announcer] Please welcome Bill Burr.
All right, whatâ€™s going on? How are you? Good evening. Good evening and welcome. Welcome to this wonderful evening of stand-up comedy. All right, you guys have great energy. I like that. Iâ€™m liking the energy already.
Itâ€™s safe to say I guess the pandemicâ€™s over? It kinda is, right? I mean, nobody gives a fuck anymore, so basically, itâ€™s over, right? It killed all the weak people, you know? The strong people are here to survive. The fatties are gone, the asthmatics, people with lisps. None of â€™em made it! But you guys survived. Yeah, you guys survived. Yeah, they said it killed a whole bunch of people, but I gotta be honest. Have you really noticed? I mean, you drive down the highway, thereâ€™s still traffic. I thought it was gonna be like, â€œWow! Holy shit, a lot of people died. Thatâ€™s so sad, but fucking awesome, all at the same time!â€
I gotta be honest though, I saw a lot of you youngsters didnâ€™t wear masks. I got upset at first, but then I did the math. I understand why you didnâ€™t wear â€™em. You know what I mean? You knew you were gonna survive. Right? You went to college. You bought the dream. You left with the debt and there was no jobs. So you played the only card you had. Get COVID and breathe on somebody older with a corner office. Thatâ€™s what you do, all right? Power is not given away. It has to be taken. And people have to die, historically speaking. People have to go.
You know what did amaze me during all of this? Was the amount of shit that doctors got from non-doctorsâ€¦ slash complete fucking morons. People who had to go to summer school. â€œAccording to my Internet research, if you take a little bleach, vitamin D and aspirinâ€¦â€ And people are like, listening to â€™em. Like, my favorite heckle doctors got from people was, like, â€œDude, whatâ€™s the last thing they even cured? What? Fucking polio?â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œNo. HPV.â€ They just came out with a vaccine for HPV. No more warts on your dick. We should be carrying these people around on our shoulders. Thank youâ€¦ for not having to make me go down to the doctor. And be like, â€œThatâ€™s not a birthmark, is it?â€ Or even worse, youâ€™re too shy to go, so you try to do self-surgery with a frozen Bud Light can. â€œStick it on there, freeze it off!â€ Bud Light, one of the big sponsors of this comedy tonight.
They say that, â€œWhat was the last thing they cured?â€ How about AIDS? Dude, AIDS was gonna kill everybody. You get it from fucking. It was over. Now look at it. Now you can get it, they give you one pill. It doesnâ€™t even show up on a test! You can go out and bang somebody, no condom, they donâ€™t even get it! According to my Internet research! Donâ€™t listen to me, but I think thatâ€™s what I overheard in a bar.
â€œWhatâ€™s the last thing they cured?â€ Do you know what fake legs looked like when I was a kid? Huh? First of all, there was only one color, it was like Band-Aid color. And everybody knew you had a fake leg. Youâ€™re fucking walking down the street and everybodyâ€¦ â€œHeâ€™s got a fake leg! What do you think happened?â€ Motorcycle accident, fell down a flight of stairs, got impatient with a woodchipper. Right? Everybody knew you had a fake leg. Now, if you have fake legs, youâ€™re not allowed to compete with people with real legs in the Olympics, because not having legs is now more of an advantage than having real legs. Doctors make better legs than God. All right, your calves, and your feet flopping around, are no match for a couple of sickles. These people just skiing down the fucking street. You get â€™em by some train tracks that go downhill, youâ€™re never gonna see â€™em again!
I enjoyed people being their own doctors. I loved it. Good, kill yourselves, kill yourselves. Thereâ€™s too many of us, itâ€™s fantastic.
All right, this is a weird thing to say in LA, but Iâ€™m really into guns. I do. I love guns. I donâ€™t own a gun, I didnâ€™t grow up with them, so, I know that Iâ€™m an idiot, so Iâ€™ll probably kill myself, but I donâ€™t have a problem with guns, you know? Liberals gotta quit trying to take away conservative peopleâ€™s guns, they just gotta stop doing that shit. Because when you try to take away their guns, then you get them in a corner where they gotta start defending everybody with a gun. You know? Like that fucking idiot, Rittenhouse, right? That moron. And theyâ€™re gonna sit there like, â€œNo, heâ€™s a bright guy. He was a good guy with a gun.â€ My favorite thing about that was why did he go up there? Itâ€™s like, â€œWell, he loved his town. He loved it.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œOh, yeah, when it snows out, does he show up with a shovel?â€ â€œPrivate Rittenhouse, reporting for duty. Boy, oh boy, do I love this sidewalk. My goodness.â€
Iâ€™ll tell ya, that guy went there to feel threatened. And he felt threatened and he fucking killed two people. Turns out the two people he killed were a convicted child molester, and a skateboarder. Two of the most annoying people in society. So as dumb as this kid is, he somehow went two for two. Unbelievable! Itâ€™s like when they bring some fat guy out of the crowd, halftime at an NBA game, â€œYou hit this half-court shot, fatty, you could win a Dodgeâ€“ fucking Durango.â€ â€œAll right.â€ [shouts] [blows air] â€œNothing but net! Holy shit!â€ Yeah, Rittenhouse did it twice, â€œI got the other side! Bam! Skateboarder, go fuck yourself!â€
People try to say his mother drove him to the riot. I donâ€™t believe that, I think thatâ€™s some liberal horseshit they made up. I just canâ€™t imagine that conversation going down like that. Like, sheâ€™s sitting at home, hears him upstairs and is like, â€œHoney! Honey, what are you doing? You going out tonight? What are you doing?â€ â€œGoing to a riot.â€ â€œDo you want a ride?â€ â€œAll right, but you gotta drop me off like two blocks away, so my other racist friends donâ€™t see my mommy drove me.â€ â€œAll right, are you gonna wear a jacket?â€ â€œMom!â€ â€œDonâ€™t yell at me the way your father did! And bring your AR-15. Iâ€™ll see you in the car.â€
I donâ€™t know about that dude. Only thing I can say about that dude is I hope he never does a 23andMe. Okay, because with those big pouty lips I donâ€™t think heâ€™s gonna like the results. Then heâ€™s gonna have to go down to the hideout, knocking on the door, â€œCome on, man, Iâ€™m like 91% you.â€ â€œUnd the FÃ¼hrer only accepts 100% percent Caucasian!â€
All right, give yourselves a round of applause, everybody!
[applause]
Weâ€™re gonna keep this show going. Weâ€™ve got nothing, nothing but killers on this show. You guys are an awesome crowd, and I canâ€™t think of a better way to start this show.
This is one of my favorite joke writers out there. Sheâ€™s written for all the late-night shows, even performed for a president, and sheâ€™s here tonight for you. Please welcome the amazing Michelle Wolf!
Come on, everybody!
[cheers and applause]
Give it up for Bill!
[cheers and applause]
You know, weâ€™re both redheads, I donâ€™t know if this is a show or a fetish. I, um, I want women to get ahead.
[light whooping]
Yeah, we only needed four. I want women to get ahead, but I just donâ€™t know if itâ€™s gonna happen. Because, uh, weâ€™re not good at it. Like, we have the first female vice president, and everyone got really excited. They were like, â€œNow little girls everywhere, little girls everywhere will know itâ€™s possible.â€ Yeah, little girls everywhere else already knew it was possible. Americaâ€™s like the last place to have a female leader. Sheâ€™s not even reallyâ€¦ the leader. Weâ€™re like, the last place to have a female leader.
Kosovoâ€™s been a country for 13 years, theyâ€™ve already had two female leaders. Germany had Angela Merkel for I donâ€™t know how long, long enough for me to know itâ€™s â€œAn-guh-lah.â€ Myanmarâ€™s one of the least developed countries in Asia. Itâ€™s had a female leader whoâ€™s been overthrown by the military twice! And each time, that little Asian lady claws her way back up to the top. She is definitely not a white woman. She wouldâ€™ve just stayed down and been like, â€œThis is not fair.â€ â€œLittle girls everywhereâ€¦â€
Some people make the argument, theyâ€™re like, â€œWell, some people just need to see it happen to know itâ€™s possible.â€ All right, well then, youâ€™re not a leader. Thatâ€™s like the exact opposite definition of a leader. Like, â€œGuys, Iâ€™m gonna show you the way, if you could justâ€“ if I could follow you maybe.â€ And use that anywhere else, youâ€™re in school. Youâ€™re in school, youâ€™re looking at someoneâ€™s paper, and theyâ€™re likeâ€“ the teacher comes up to you and sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat are you doing?â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œI just need to know it was possible.â€ â€œLittle girls.â€
And they only do this when good things happen to women. They donâ€™t do this when bad things happen to women or when women achieve bad things. You know, like when 2Â GirlsÂ 1Â Cup came out, no one was likeâ€¦ â€œNow little girls everywhereâ€¦â€
I make fun of white women a lot. But only because itâ€™s fun and easy. You know? And white women, we blame a lot of stuff on white men. We blame a lot of stuff on white men, which I think is a little bit crazy because we did make you. Itâ€™s just made me very sure of one thing. White women should never be allowed to make robots. Before you get all, like huffy, Iâ€™m not saying you canâ€™t make robots, although I doubt it a little bit. Iâ€™m notâ€“ Iâ€™m just saying you should never be allowed to make robots, because if robots get out of hand and start taking over everything and being real evil, white women will be like, â€œWell, I donâ€™t know, I just love â€™em.â€ â€œI mean, not my robot.â€
Not all white women are bad. Some white women really do try to put in the work. They try to do good things. You know, like, uh, two summers ago, we realized that Black lives matter. Then we fixed it. We did. Waiting till two summers ago to realize Black lives matter is like needing to see that documentary to know SeaWorld is bad. Like, â€œDid you know whales shouldnâ€™t live in a sink?â€
But white women, they really put in the work, you know? We protested. We made signs. We really tried. But then something terrible happened to a lot of white women. Something terrible happened to us. Some of us realized that weâ€™ve actually been racist this whole time. We were shocked! We were so shocked, we pulled our purse closer.
But after that, we were like, â€œWell, from now on, weâ€™re gonna learn, weâ€™re gonna listen, weâ€™re gonna hear, weâ€™re gonna open a small Black business. But most importantly, from now on, weâ€™re gonna do better. We wanna do better.â€ And all jokes aside, I think thatâ€™s the only way forward for us as a society. You canâ€™t change the past. All you can do is better moving forward. And I think thatâ€™s what we should try to do.
[cheers and applause]
Exceptâ€¦ thatâ€™s almost exactly the same thing men said about #MeToo, and we found that answer completely unacceptable. Men were like, â€œUs? The whole time?â€ â€œWell, from now on, weâ€™re gonna learn, weâ€™re gonna listen, weâ€™re gonna hear, weâ€™re gonna open a small Black business. But most importantly, from now on, weâ€™re gonna do better. We wanna do better.â€ And we were like, â€œNo! Not good enough! You all have to die! It doesnâ€™t matter what you did, you couldâ€™ve raped somebody or accidentally whispered into a boob. Itâ€™s all the same! And you have to die!â€ #MeToo was the worst-run movement Iâ€™ve ever seen. We ran #MeToo like Amelia Earhart. We crashed it immediately. It shouldâ€™ve been a conversation. We needed to have a conversation about these things, and you werenâ€™t even allowed to ask questions. And I know men had questions, because I had questions. Like Iâ€™d hear some women say something that was a #MeToo, and Iâ€™d be like, â€œHey, the thing that you just said is a #MeToo, is actually a thing that I like.â€ So how do we tell men about that? Some women would be like, â€œMen shouldnâ€™t use their power to have sex.â€ And then other women would be like, â€œI like it when men use their power to have sex.â€ And then men were like, â€œCan you tell us which one you are? And we were like, â€œNo! But for different reasons.â€ Some women would be like, â€œThis man, he hit on me at work. It made me uncomfortable. Thatâ€™s harassment.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œOkay, so do you want no one to hit on you at work?â€ â€œNo, I only want the men who I want to hit on me to hit on me at work.â€ â€œOkay, do you wanna make, like, a list of who they are?â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™m mysterious.â€ â€œWell then, buckle up, Nancy Drew, youâ€™ve got some uncomfortable times headed your way.â€
White women, we do this all the time, we say, â€œYou made me uncomfortable. Iâ€™m uncomfortable.â€ Like weâ€™re supposed to be comfortable. Iâ€™ve never been comfortable once in my entire life. When Iâ€™m about to fall asleep, at my most relaxed, when Iâ€™m about to fall asleep, my body jerks awake, like, â€œNever rest, bitch!â€
We say everything makes us uncomfortableâ€“ men, womenâ€“ We say women make us uncomfortable. Thatâ€™s the one I hate the most. We say women of color, all the time, we tell them they make us uncomfortable. Like, a couple of years ago, at the Super Bowl, we say J. Lo and Shakira made us uncomfortable. A couple years before that at the Super Bowl, we said BeyoncÃ© made us uncomfortable. A couple years before that at the Super Bowl, we said Janet Jackson made us uncomfortable.
I think a lot of white women only see women of color at the Super Bowl. Theyâ€™re like, â€œThis show is different than Friends.â€
But this one makes me so mad, because this one, women, we say itâ€™s family values. We say, â€œHow dare those women move their hips like that in front of my children and my husband. Itâ€™s immoral.â€ I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s the word you meant. I think you meant â€œjealous.â€ â€œHow dare you show my husband how hips can move like mine canâ€™t.â€ You ever seen a white woman try to twerk? You ever seen it? It looks like Pinocchio trying to walk as a real boy for the first time. Just likeâ€¦ â€œAm I doing it?â€
Thank you, guys, very much. Iâ€™m Michelle Wolf, have a good night.
[cheers and applause]
[Burr] Michelle Wolf, everybody! Michelle Wolf, come on! Killing it, killing it. All right, you guys hanging in there, youâ€™re having a good time, right? Just keeps getting better. All right, this next guy comes all the way from London, England, one of the biggest comics out there, he has a great special out called His Dark Material on Netflix, please welcome the one and only Jimmy Carr, everybody, come on!
[cheers and applause]
Nice. Okay. Thank you, thank you very much. Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, Iâ€™m Jimmy Carr. Itâ€™s great to be with you here this evening. Iâ€™ll tell you why itâ€™s great to be here. Weâ€™re drinking, my friends, in the Last Chance Saloon. What Iâ€™m saying onstage tonight is barely acceptable now. In ten yearsâ€™ time, fucking forget about it. Youâ€™re gonna be able to tell your grandchildren about seeing this show. Yeah. Youâ€™ll say, â€œI saw a man, and he stood on stage, and he made light of serious situations. We used to call them jokes. And people would laugh.â€ And your grandchildren will ask, theyâ€™ll say, â€œNon-binary elder.â€
[laughter]
â€œNon-binary elder, whatâ€™s a joke?â€ And youâ€™ll say, â€œYou are.â€ I say you can joke about anything, but not with anyone. I think with you good people this evening, I should be fine, right?
[audience cheers]
Well, letâ€™s see, shall we? Weâ€™ll put that to the test. Having sex is like riding a bikeâ€¦ my uncle taught me when I was a kid. People say the best things in life are free, but those people have clearly never had sex. I like it when the girl puts the condom on for you, but I was asked to leave the pharmacy. My girlfriend doesnâ€™t think that her sister is trustworthy, but believe me, that girl can keep a secret. Is anyone here in a controlling relationship? Raise your partnerâ€™s hand. Yes. I want One Direction to do a BTS covers medley at my funeral, because that way, Iâ€™ll be glad Iâ€™m dead. Now, you might think this is silly, but I assure you itâ€™s absolutely true. When Zane left One Direction, for me, it was like 9/11. Yeah, I didnâ€™t care about that either. Well, thereâ€™s a real generational divide there, I can seeâ€¦ Some people are looking at me like, â€œ9/11, steady on.â€ And other people are looking at me like, â€œOne Direction, donâ€™t take their name in vain!â€ I was actually supposed to be on one of the planes on 9/11. But the more interesting story is how I met Osama.
When youâ€™re young, pedophiles are something to laugh at, the local creep. But then you grow up, have your own kids, with their own unique personalities and quirks and difficulties, and it suddenly hits you. â€œWhat the fuck do these pedos see in these little shits?â€
I can do a brilliant Michael Jackson impersonation, would you like to see it?
[audience cheers]
Okay, I just need a young volunteer who can keep a secret, come on up. Yeah. What are you getting up for? Wait a second, this is a teachable moment. If a grown man beckons you forth, as he undoes his flies, this is some stranger danger, son. Whatâ€™s your name?
Mikey.
[Carr] Mikey. Letâ€™s hear it for Mikey, everyone. Thatâ€“ because, you know why? That is commitment to a night out at a comedy show. That is a young man thatâ€™s thought to himself, â€œOh, itâ€™s the bit in the show where I suck his cock. Great!â€
Everyone loved Michael Jackson in the â€™80s, right? He was the coolest guy in the world. Coolest guy in the world, bar none. And really, the high point of that cool was the moonwalk at the Grammys. Remember that? People lost their minds at how cool it was, when really, the moonwalk was no more thanâ€“ it was that. I know Iâ€™m not nailing this, but that was the gist of it, right? That was the coolest shit weâ€™d ever fucking seen! Of course, we didnâ€™t realize at the time, it had been developed for sneaking in and out of childrenâ€™s bedrooms. We had no idea. Itâ€™s so obvious now. Now, Iâ€™ve never fucked a kid. I nearly did just then, didnâ€™t I? But Iâ€™ve never fucked a kid. But if I did fuck a kid, I think I know how Iâ€™d leave the room. Do you remember the incident in the â€™90s with Michael Jackson? Where he was on tour in Germany? He had the whole top floor of a hotel? And he had the baby, and he held the baby over the balcony, and he shook the baby. Crazy. You canâ€™t get cum off a baby like that.
[cheers and applause]
Somewhat ironically that has really separated the men from the boys, hasnâ€™t it?
Iâ€™ve been Jimmy Carr, thank you very much indeed. Cheers. Good night. Thank you. Cheers.
[Burr] Jimmy Carr, everybody. Not bad for a foreigner, huh? Yeah, he comes from England. Thatâ€™s ground zero for white people right there. Yes, it is. Thatâ€™s why I got the vaccine, because they were testing it out in England first. And Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s the whitest fucking place ever. That shit must work.â€ Right? If they tried it out initially in Haiti, Iâ€™d be like, â€œAll right. My people are up to their old tricks again.â€ â€œAre they putting it in blankets?â€ â€œOh!â€ It happened. Youâ€™re groaning history, you fucking pussies.
All right, letâ€™s keep this show moving along. This next comedian, I actually just saw a clip of her on Instagram a couple months ago and instantly became a huge fan. Sheâ€™s absolutely hilarious. I love her to death. Please welcome Steph Tolev, everybody. Come on, Steph Tolev.
[cheers and applause]
[Burr] Welcome back.
[Tolev shouts] Hey! How the hell are we? This is nice, â€˜scuse me, gotta air out the puss, huh? Gotta let the big olâ€™ gal breathe a bit, huh, ladies? Take in a deep, big breath of air, huh? Iâ€™m wearing shorts, what are you, 16? Youâ€™re like, â€œWhoopsies, excuse me, how are we?â€ Iâ€™m kidding, I check IDs. How are we? This is fun. How do we like the mullet?
[audience cheers]
Okay, now thatâ€™s a reaction! Did any straight men clap? Not enough of you, not enough! Damn it all to hell. I am straight, and this haircut is not fucking helping me. Neither is anything Iâ€™m doing right now. Does this help, if I take a knee? Is this what men like? When a gal gets down like this? Iâ€™m straight, Iâ€™ll prove it right now, I swear to God. Little guy, get up here, Iâ€™ll jerk you off right now, I swear to God. Bring your little friend, Iâ€™ll do you both at the same time. Yeah! Fuck! Like those ropes in the gymâ€¦ All right! Here we go! Fuck! Iâ€™ll make â€™em slap, donâ€™t worry. Oh, itâ€™s not gonna feel good, no, no, no. No, youâ€™re not gonna like it at all. Iâ€™ll make sure you finish, donâ€™t worry. [laughs evilly] Itâ€™ll take a while. Iâ€™m so sorry, I donâ€™t wanna be like this, umâ€¦ Iâ€™ve tried women, I have. Youâ€™re like, â€œWe know.â€ Iâ€™ve tried several times. I keep ending up down there, Iâ€™m like, â€œThis again? What the heck am I eating out?â€ I finish my plate though, Iâ€™m not rude. Iâ€™m not gonna leave it, thatâ€™s rude, I lick the whole thing clean. What am I, a waste? I donâ€™t think so. Oh, Iâ€™m not a rude person, I swear to God. Dating in LA is a nightmare, can we agree? Itâ€™s a fucking piece of shit, dating here?
[light cheering]
Yeah. Four people, the rest of you are in love. Go suck my ass. Pieces of shit. Iâ€™m a boiled ham in Los Angeles on Tinder. Donâ€™tâ€“ Relax, Iâ€™m a hot piece in Grand Rapids, Michigan. So donâ€™t worry. Yeah, get my tits sucked right off in Michigan, feels good. I will say though, I did clean up on Tinder in LA during the pandemic because, ooh, all the hot boys, you got real sad, didnâ€™t ya? You got real lonely. And you got real desperate. And all the pretty blond girls didnâ€™t swipe right, did they? Guess who did? [laughs] Old Stephy T. crawled out of the well. [laughs] Oh yeah, I fucked a bunch of tens. Felt good, felt good. Yeah, thank you, it felt good to be on top for once, it really did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. One cried. Paul. Yeah, he was very upset. Heâ€™s like, â€œCan we please turn lights off?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWeâ€™re keeping them on.â€ I was being disgusting during the pandemic, just being a gross person. I was having sex outside. Iâ€™m like, â€œYou canâ€™t get COVID if youâ€™re in a field.â€ You can get chlamydia, though. You can, you can. Yeah, but is it chlamydia if all of the STD clinics are closed? Yeah, it was chlamydia, yeah, for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You need a pill for that drip, big time, big time. Only person whoâ€™s had an STD, shut up. Iâ€™ll come by and check your underwear one by one. Youâ€™re like, â€œThis is very strange, please donâ€™t.â€ Are you pigs still 69-ing out there?
[audience cheering]
Disgusting, every last one of you. I think it should be a federal offense. You should be arrested on sight for doing it. Itâ€™s for young, hot, thin people. You get older, you get bigger, things get slippy, things get sloppy. I got duped by a man at 10:00 a.m. with two rattails. Itâ€™s a lot to unpack. Take that in for a second. Two rattails? One rattail too many. Two rattails? Two too many. 10:00 a.m., 69 lady? No oneâ€™s ready for that. On all fours, sun beaming directly into your asshole. Oh, you all have pristine anuses in this room? I donâ€™t think so. The same mullet on my head, also over my asshole. Doesnâ€™t matter how many times I shave. Thereâ€™s a couple stragglers back there, huh? Couple loosies peeking out to say, â€œHello! Miss me?â€ Iâ€™m on all fours, sucking in, Iâ€™m tucking in, everythingâ€™s hanging out. Oh, only one other woman has a fat labia? Yeah, right. No one has the old dog tongue, just hanging out the side? Iâ€™m the only one? Relax. Iâ€™m holding onto his ankles, his feet are so dirty for some reason. Covered with hair and crumbs, Iâ€™m like, â€œWhere were you before this, man? â€œWalking around a play place? Turn on a sock, what are you doing?â€ Looking at his long, disgusting balls. Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t think theyâ€™re supposed to be stretched out like this, why is it? It just looks like something ran it over before you got here. You need to seek medical attention immediately after this.â€ Sniffing the tip of his disgusting penis. Every man in this room thinks that women smell down there. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but, your cock fucking reeks. Sorry. Excuse me. Yeah, the guys got real quiet, huh? Letâ€™s see who we got here, guy in the front row. Youâ€™ve got a stinker. Youâ€™ve got an old, tiny, middle of a book stink, huh? The Old Testament, this guy smells like. So easy to clean it, simple stuff. Go to the bathroom, fill up the sink, dip him in. Splish splash, just the tip, mwah, a little smooch to the water. You donâ€™t think every girl in here has gone to freshen up? You guys know what freshening up means? When we go, â€œBe right back!â€ [laughs] In the bathroom, sink on, leg up, full blast likeâ€¦ â€œFuck me! Fuck! Heâ€™s gonna know!â€ Using that watered-down soap, if thereâ€™s no suds, thatâ€™s no longer soap. Thatâ€™s water in a jar. Using that crusted towel, just wipes the water around. Come out dripping, heâ€™s like, â€œYou ready to go?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m horny, letâ€™s fucking do this. You made me so wet.â€ Men donâ€™t like funny women. You say you do, you say you want it. No, you donâ€™t. No you donâ€™t, youâ€™re liars. Especially in the bedroom. Not the time, not the place, donâ€™t bring the jokes to the boudoir. Kept doing this one bit where I take out a guyâ€™s dick and go, â€œIs this thing on?â€ Never got a laugh, not once. Did it for a year, it was like, â€œRead the room.â€ Kept doing this other bit, this one I had to stop because guys were getting freaked out before weâ€™d finish up. Heâ€™d be like, â€œOh, what do I do with the condom?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™ll take that.â€ â€œIâ€™m saving it for later!â€ And I would pretend that I had a weird mini-fridge in my room for some reason, Iâ€™m like, â€œItâ€™s still warm.â€ [growls] Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy am I acting like a gargoyle the second sex is finished?â€ So if anybody wants to come back to my well tonight, I got a little bit more room in the fridge. [growls] Thank you so much, my name is Steph Tolev.
[cheers and applause]
Steph Tolev, everybody, Steph Tolev. Come on! Amazing, amazing. â€œMiddle of a book stink.â€ I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll forget that. I donâ€™t even read, and I know what that smells like. The next people coming to the stage, two of my favorite comedians actually come out together and do something called â€œBumping Mics.â€ Please welcome Jeff Ross and Dave Attell.
[cheers and applause]
Whatâ€™s up? Here you go. Boom! Bump it out!
Howâ€™s it going, everybody?
Bump it out! Yes! Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m talking about! Awesome!
Yeah!
Look at it. This is amazing, Dave.
Welcome to Hollywood, baby.
We did it. Netflix is a Joke Comedy Festival, what do you think? Dude, I am so excited, I gotta tell you something. First of all, I havenâ€™t seen this guy in like, three variants. And you know, Jeff, I know, um, you canâ€™t stay all night because you have to get up early to work security at a food court. But, umâ€¦ Thanks, Dave. Itâ€™s a slamfest, my friend. Iâ€™m gonna be nice to you, I donâ€™t wanna tease you becauseâ€¦ you know, Dave and I, Daveâ€™s had some health issues, we have the same doctor. My proctologist is Daveâ€™s ear, nose, and throat doctor. Jeff, you know what? Daveâ€™sâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna keep going, motherfucker. Go ahead, buddy, hit me with something already. Daveâ€™s not on TikTok, but he does have seconds to live. Everyone loves a math joke.
Can I do some more? Can Iâ€“ Hold on!
Dave how long have youâ€¦
Can I do someâ€¦
No! Daveâ€™s not just a good comedian, heâ€™s also a great impressionist. Every night he does an impression of Amber Heard when he shits his bed. Oh, dude, all right, thatâ€™s it. Hey, itâ€™s time for me to go. All right? Jeff, you know, I have to tell you this, all right? Youâ€™re the kind of guy who buys a gerbil, but keeps the receipt, just in case it doesnâ€™t fit. All right? They grow, they grow. Iâ€™m just telling you, buddy. I donâ€™t care, Dave, Iâ€™m feeling invincible. I just got my 38th vaccine shot.
[Attell] Sweet. Johnson & Johnson & Johnson & Johnson & Johnson & Johnsonâ€¦
[Attell] Thatâ€™s the best. Iâ€™ve been licking strangersâ€™ assholes at the airport all day, I feel great. Oh, why not? Did you get vaccinated? Well, Iâ€™m old, so I got mine in 1919. You know, it was me, Chaplin, andâ€¦ This crowdâ€™s so young, they donâ€™t even know what weâ€™re talking about here. I got COVID. Any other COVID survivors?
[audience cheers]
Anybody else lose their sense of taste? I went to see the Dave Matthews Band at the Greek.
Nice one.

And look at this crowd, dude, I know how you love to jump into the crowd. You are the Roastmaster. Are you going down? Go down, buddy. Get down there. Here he comes, everyone, the Roastmaster.

Stand up for a second.
Oh. Look, itâ€™s Dave Chappelleâ€™s security guard. Wow. I got a question for this guy.
What?
Whatâ€™s your name, buddy? My nameâ€™s Ari. Ari, what time does Legoland open? I wanna knowâ€¦ Who you here with, Ari? The rest of the yeshiva? This guy right here, the whole cast of Squid Game.
[Attell] Yes!
Thank you for coming. I won a lot of money on you, man. Way to go. This is like an infomercial for My Pillow. I love it. Miss, how ya doing? Dave, you have a cat joke for this woman? Nice.
Whatâ€™s your name?
Kat.
Jeff, we only got seven minutes before they take back the audio. Come on. Get back up here, dude. We have to bring it, buddy.
Itâ€™s a good crowd, Dave, very good crowd.
Theyâ€™re awesome.
I got a big week coming up.
What are you doing? I have an audition tomorrow for Alec Baldwinâ€™s new sitcom. What is it? Yeah, itâ€™s called â€œ30 Glock.â€ Itâ€™s a cross between Just Shoot Me! and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Oh, my God.
Is nothing sacred?
Nothing. What about you? Whatâ€™s going on with you? Well, you saw that movie about my career, A Quiet Place?
Yeah.
And, umâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what to tell ya, buddy, umâ€¦ We comics, we need each other.
And we need to laugh more than ever.
[Attell] We do. I wanna give a shout-out to my friend, and Daveâ€™s favorite comic of all time, Gilbert Gottfried who passed away recently. One of the greats. He was a great guy. I was with him the night before he passed away, and then you went to see him. You might be the last person that ever saw him alive. Yes, Iâ€™ll never forget holding that pillow over his head. Andâ€“ I was trying to make him comfortable. In honor of our friend Gilbert, can we have a moment of screaming? Yes.
[audience screams]
Thank you, I love you guys so much.
Can we bring Bill out for a second?
[Attell] Yeah, letâ€™s bring Bill out. Here he comes.
Whatâ€™s up, gentlemen?
Captain of the ship. Hi, Bill. I donâ€™t like standing in between the two of you guys. Feel like youâ€™re gonna say something, make me hurt my feelings or something. Thanks for having us on your shitty show. Itâ€™s awesome. Well, they said we want to get some of the shittiest comics we could find, and I said, â€œI can get you two for one.â€
[Attell] Thank you.
[all laugh]
Hey!
[Attell] Good hit, Bill.
[Ross] Thatâ€™s good. Why are you wearing a childrenâ€™s bathrobe? Nice one, Bill. I always wondered what the Blue Man Group would look like when they werenâ€™t wearing the makeup. And itâ€™sâ€“ Oh, guilty as charged. I like it. I like it, Dave. Dave, I gotta tell you, youâ€™re my favorite hoarder. [laughs] Thank you. Nice to see you wore your clean jacket for this TV taping. Bill, and I can never thank you enough for letting me live in your car. I reallyâ€¦ Daveâ€™s dressed for Wednesday and Thursday. Thank you. You look like that guy they interview on the news, â€œThis guy was here to see it!â€
Nice.
â€œCan you tell us what happened, sir?â€ You guysâ€¦
Bill Burr is such a great guyâ€¦
Fuck you, Jeff.
A great comedian.
Get off the stage. He is. Heâ€™s one of the best. This guyâ€™s so New England, heâ€™s the color of clam chowder.
[all laugh]
[Attell] Nice.
[Burr] Oh, that one hurt.
[Attell] You got him. You got him good. You look like you just got fished out of a lake. Jeff looks like Bill if he made way better choices. Iâ€™m good with that.
Yes.
I look like Bill Burp. I have the best job because I get to work with my favorite comedian.
Aw, thanks.
Thank you, Dave. Thank you for coming to LA. Thank you for having me on the show.
Thank you guys for being awesome.
Jeff Ross, Dave Attell. Bill Burr.
â€œBumping Mics.â€
Thank you, Bill. Leaving me hanging on the five. â€œBumping Mics.â€ Jeff Ross, Dave Attell. Two Jews without money. You donâ€™t see that a lot. They really looked homeless, didnâ€™t they?
This next guy coming to the stage, heâ€™s one of my favorite comics, I started out with him a long time ago back in New York, when we both had hair. Heâ€™s one of the best joke writers I ever met, and a tremendous person. Please welcome Ian Edwards, everybody. Come on!
[cheers and applause]
Whatâ€™s up, everybody? Howâ€™s everybody doing?
[audience cheering]
Shit, Iâ€™m the only Black guy on the show, and I gotta follow two white guys. Everybody good?
[audience cheering]
All right, thatâ€™s dope. All right, Jimmy earlier was talking about Michael Jackson. And I spent a lot of the pandemic watching TV. If you have seen the Michael Jackson documentary on HBO and still listen to his music, you are a piece of shit. Straight trash. Now, I on the other hand, have not seen the documentary. So I can listen to his music guilt-free, you know what Iâ€™m saying? Yâ€™all fucked-up, I found a loophole. Michael Jackson for life, baby. Yeah. I even canceled my HBO subscription. Just so I donâ€™t stumble across that shit on accident. Iâ€™m sorry, yâ€™all, I was raised on Michael Jackson, and I heard he ruined those kidsâ€™ childhood. I ainâ€™t gonna watch that shit and have him ruin mine. Also watched Handmaidâ€™s Tale. Any Handmaidâ€™s Tale fans in the house?
[audience cheering]
All right, we got some. Itâ€™s based on a book written in 1984, and itâ€™s a fictional story, set in a dystopian future, where a totalitarian government enslaves America, and then we have a hero, her name is June Osborne, and she rescues her baby, and then stays behind. And then she rescues 78 other people, and then stays behind. Then she escapes, comes back, and rescues 25 other people. And I was talking to the homie, and I was like, â€œWait a minute. This is the Harriet Tubman story.â€ Itâ€™s like the author moved slavery to the future, and made white women the heroes. Which is fucked-up. â€˜Cause Black people, we didnâ€™t want slavery, but now you canâ€™t steal it from us. And then charge us money to watch it on Hulu. Now we gotta pay for this shit twice? And now you canâ€™t even make the Harriet Tubman story, â€™cause everybodyâ€™s gonna be like, â€œHey, man, thatâ€™s Handmaidâ€™s Tale. I canâ€™t believe these Black people are culturally appropriating from us.â€
Iâ€™m glad the pandemic is over. You know, one thing I do miss about the pandemic was the no traffic. Like, no traffic in LA was mwah! Right? Right? I used to get in my car during the pandemic, and the homies would be like, â€œWhere are you going?â€ And Iâ€™d be like, â€œNowhere. I just wanna see how long it really takes to get there.â€ â€œTwo minutes? Why the fuck did this shit used to take five days?â€ But now traffic is back. Donâ€™t you all feel frustrated in traffic? Yeah? Am I the only person here that feels like murdering someone in traffic? All right, cool. That makes me comfortable enough to admit to yâ€™all that regular traffic bugs me way more than sex trafficking. You feel me? â€˜Cause a sex traffickerâ€™s never made me late for work. They actually gotta be the best drivers on the road. â€˜Cause they canâ€™t afford to get into an accident. Or pulled over. So whenever youâ€™re driving and some dude is like, â€œGo ahead, cut in front of me, youâ€™re good, youâ€™re good.â€ Thatâ€™s a vicious fucking animal right there. With two girls tied up in his trunk. And whenever some dude cuts you off, gives you the finger, and then steps out of his truck to fight you, thatâ€™s a decent human being. With nothinâ€™ to hide. Shake his hand. Heâ€™s grinding for his family. I feel really bad for women who are being sex trafficked, and theyâ€™re stuck in traffic. And I know it sounds cold-blooded, but Iâ€™m a dude. I donâ€™t have to worry about sex trafficking. I donâ€™t have any daughters, and my sisters are not in sex trafficking shape. I know itâ€™s fucked-up. All right, let me just ask one question before I get outta here. Why do pregnant couples have gender reveal parties when they donâ€™t know what gender their kid is gonna claim? Right? Why donâ€™t they just wait a few birthdays, and then let the kid tell them? And then they can have the party. What if youâ€™re wrong? Youâ€™re gonna be wrong and burn down half of California? Then you have this video of this party that you threw for your kid that you can never show your kid. Then you got to tell everybody who was at the party, â€œDonâ€™t ever tell my child about that fucking party.â€ And you know the kidâ€™s gonna find the video. And one day, heâ€™s like, â€œHey, yâ€™all, get in here. What the fuck is this? That smoke ainâ€™t me. Canâ€™t believe you spent all this money on this party, and I need that money for my operationâ€¦ so I can be who I really wanna be.â€ All Iâ€™m saying is, if youâ€™re a dad, and you always wanted a son, and the smoke is pink, donâ€™t give up.â€ My name is Ian Edwards. Good night, yâ€™all. Peace.
[cheers and applause]
Ian Edwards! This next guy coming to the stage is one of my great friends that Iâ€™ve had in life. Forget about as a stand-up comedian, heâ€™s an absolutely amazing friend and stand-up comedian, I love him to death. Please welcome the one and only Joe Bartnick, everybody. Come on, Joe Bartnick!
[cheers and applause]
What is up, Los Angeles?
[cheers and applause]
Iâ€™m in a good mood, Iâ€™m feeling good. I recently lost 80 pounds.
[audience cheers]
I know what youâ€™re thinking, â€œHe still kinda looks like shit.â€ I know, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m wearing a collared shirt, you got man-titties, you gotta wear a collar. Takes 15 right off the top. Thatâ€™s why golfers wear â€™em, it makes â€™em almost look athletic. Like, I canâ€™t wear a wifebeater. You canâ€™t wear a wifebeater, if you look like a wife beater. If you have a six pack, wear a wifebeater. If you just drank a six pack, keep your sleeves on. I know a young girl like yourself, you want abs. I get it. But the older ladies who have lost all their hopes and dreams, they dig the dad bod. Yeah, ladies, this body says â€œfun.â€ This body says, â€œEverybodyâ€™s getting appetizers.â€ Nobody has to split dessert with this body. This bodyâ€™s built for comfort. This body sleeps in on Saturdays. Nobody has to get up and ride a bike with this body. Glad I lost the weight, though, â€™cause now I can shop at Marshallâ€™s again. Yeah, â€™cause now I can fit in double-X clothing. Thereâ€™s nothing left at Marshallâ€™s with triple-X. Itâ€™s all green or purple or fuchsia. I canâ€™t wear those colors. Iâ€™m not Black. Yeah, Black guys look good in anything. Black guys look good bald. Imagine me bald. Black guys look good in dreadlocks. A white guy has dreadlocks, youâ€™re like, â€œFucking asshole.â€ Black guy has â€™em, youâ€™re like, â€œThat guyâ€™s cool.â€ Iâ€™m not even really white. Iâ€™m Italian. Yeah. We werenâ€™t white until the â€™40s. Till Frank Sinatra and Joe DiMaggio. You have to be really good at something, then theyâ€™ll let you be white. Like Obama, they let him be white. Prince, Prince was white. OJ was white for a while, then he fucked it up. Will Smith is the whitest man alive. He assaulted a Black dude and they gave him an award.
Tiger Woods is white again! How awesome is that? I fucking love Tiger. Heâ€™s my man. Wearing the black pants and the red shirt on Sunday. I love Tiger so much I used to listen to golf on the radio. People got upset when he cheated on his wife. â€œHow could he cheat on her? Sheâ€™s beautiful, sheâ€™s gorgeous, sheâ€™s an 11.â€ [whines] Thatâ€™s exactly why he cheated on her. Because sheâ€™s beautiful and gorgeous. You know she just laid there in bed and didnâ€™t move. She didnâ€™t have to. Sheâ€™s beautiful. But Tigerâ€™s got a billion dollars. He wants someone to lick his ass. Like only someone who works in an Applebeeâ€™s can.
Iâ€™m Joe Bartnick! You guys have been fantastic.
[cheers and applause]
Joe Bartnick, everybody. This next comedian, oh man, she is unbelievable. This is one of the few comics, thereâ€™s a handful of â€™em out there that if youâ€™re going on after â€™em, youâ€™re sitting in the back of the club, you gotta come up with a game plan, â€™cause she fucking destroys. Absolutely hilarious, please welcome Jessica Kirson, everybody. Come on! Jessica Kirson!
[cheers and applause]
Hey, how ya doinâ€™? Great. Iâ€™m so miserable, ugh. Although I, you know, I am a miserable person. Iâ€¦ basically, I can barely get out of bed. This is a lot, for me to be here right now. I know some of you look really sad. I donâ€™t care how this goes, I have to be honest with you. Um, it doesnâ€™t matter anymore. Basically, during COVID, I stopped chewing food. I just started fucking my face with it, Iâ€™ve never cut my wrists, but I started cutting my mouth on the inside with chips. I became a cutter on the inside, justâ€¦ [loud gag] You know, just fucking my face. And I was like, â€œIâ€™m gonna blow up again. Iâ€™m gonna blow up.â€ â€˜Cause I used to be a house. If you Google me, Zillow will come up, I was a fucking house. So, I was like, â€œI need to do something.â€ So I joined Weight Watchers, where you download the app, and it counts the points. The problem is I lie on it. I lie on my own app, and Iâ€™m the only one that sees it. Do you know how sick that is? The other day, I had a pint of ice cream, and I wrote down â€œone baby carrot.â€ Like, thatâ€™s insane. â€˜Cause I was a fat kid. Um, I was really fat. I actually went to fat camp. It was amazing, like, fat camp was the best time of my life. My parents didnâ€™t send me, I wanted to go. Every summer I was like, â€œI want to go to fat camp!â€ â€˜Cause thatâ€™s how fat kids talk, â€™cause we slam doughnuts, and muffins and furniture in our throats, like, â€œI want to go to fat camp!â€ Iâ€™m gonna keep doing it till all of you laugh. Iâ€™ll do it for the next five minutes. â€œI wanna goâ€¦â€ I just peed. Anyway, so, fat camp was fun. We all went on our own bus. We used to play a lot of fun games, like breathing, umâ€¦ chafing, try-to-hide-and-seek. Try-to-hide-and-seek was great, I would say to my friend Jodi, â€œI can see you behind the barn, you fat fuck. Find a mountain.â€ Anywayâ€¦ I have four daughters from two baby mamas. Iâ€™m like a fucking rapper, I call myself â€œLil Jew.â€ I saw an old friend recently, and sheâ€™s like, â€œYou have four daughters? Were they planned?â€ I think itâ€™s the dumbest question that anyoneâ€™s ever asked me in my entire life, if my children with women were planned. Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, I wasnâ€™t wearing protection, they were all a mistake, and weâ€™re pro-life so we kept them for Jesus. Jesus.â€ Letâ€™s get even darker with this, because some of you look uptight, like I feel like your assholes are like this right now. Yeah. Yeah, this is gonna be fun. Religious people, some of them say that gay people try to make their kids gay. That we, you know, we want them to be gay. And I hate to admit that, at this show right now with this taping, but that is totally true. That is the only reason I agreed to have children, was to create four big dykes. I donâ€™t care if my kids are kind, I donâ€™t care if theyâ€™re loving, I donâ€™t care if they smell like feces, I donâ€™t care if theyâ€™re educated, I just want them to be fucking truck drivers. Thatâ€™s all I care about. So we are doing everything we can to make that happen. And by the way, I shouldnâ€™t be telling you this, but weâ€™re out to get your kids too. This goes out to all the straight people in the audience, everywhere around the world, we have secret Facebook groups, we have a ton of funding, we have vans, we have candy, we even have long nets, where we can grab your children from off the lawn. Look how dumb some of you are, youâ€™re likeâ€¦ So we have been doing everything we can to make our children dykes. Weâ€™ve been taking them to a lot of softball games. All four of my daughters have crewcuts, they have military haircuts. Weâ€™ve been blasting the Indigo Girls and Melissa Etheridge into their ears, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They march everywhere with feminist signs, and we named all four of them Hillary Rodham Clinton, so weâ€™re justâ€¦ Jessica, that joke wouldâ€™ve done a lot better if you didnâ€™t fuck it up, but itâ€™s okay. Youâ€™re really talented, you really are. You work so hard, you know, everythingâ€™s gonna be okay. Youâ€™re almost done, itâ€™s all gonna be okay. And soon youâ€™ll be in your hotel room and you can secretly eat. You know, today you ate a bag of Tostitos and told yourself it was a serving of corn. Youâ€™re a liar. You lie to yourself on a daily basis. And the guy in the second row is not your father. Okay, some of youâ€“ yeah. Itâ€™s all gonna be okay, itâ€™s allâ€“ I love you so much, you just got that. Because it was very creative what I just did, and it was improv, but some people wonâ€™t get it, â€™cause theyâ€™re not aware. Do you understand? They have no idea what I just did. They donâ€™t understand that I just completely turned around and had a conversation with themselves. They think Iâ€™m mentally ill. Which I am, Iâ€™m heavily medicated and I havenâ€™t felt my vagina in three years. Okay, what the fuck did I just say? This is the thing, I have very bad anxiety, and loud voices make me crazy, and I was at a store the other day, and these two girls were having a conversation, and I could not believe what it sounded like, this is literally what it sounded like: [high-pitched] â€œOh my God, Chelsea, youâ€™re not gonna believe it, but I was on Instagram the other day and I posted the most amazing video, because I went to Sephora and had my makeup done, â€˜and it was like unbelievable, because it looked so good. Nobody commented, nobody did anything. I couldnâ€™t believe it because I looked so amazing, like, everyoneâ€™s upset about the war, but the war isnâ€™t happening here, so like, who cares about the war? I donâ€™t care about the warâ€¦ [gibberish] I put the same video on TikTokâ€¦ [gibberish] The other girl was like, â€œOh my God, you shouldâ€™ve called me or texted me, Iâ€™m your best friend, likeâ€¦â€ [gibberish] [normal voice] So I killed them, I fucking killed them. I know, I did. I killed them. Because I donâ€™t think you realize this, these girls arenâ€™t going anywhere. Thatâ€™s whoâ€™s gonna be in our country, theyâ€™re staying, theyâ€™re gonna have jobs. Like, your kids are gonna go to school and walk into math classâ€¦ [high-pitched] â€œOh my God, girls, welcome to math class! This is gonna be so exciting, itâ€™sâ€¦ [gibberish] Algebra! Itâ€™s gonna be amazing!â€ [normal voice] Like, youâ€™re gonna go to a therapist that talks like that. Youâ€™re gonna walk in and be like, â€œHi, Iâ€™m just really anxious.â€ [high-pitched] â€œOh my God! Youâ€™re anxious? Thatâ€™s so horrible, well, I havenâ€™t been feeling well at all. Like, I havenâ€™t been able to swallow. I met the cutest guy the other day, I swallowed his load, I was likeâ€¦ I swallowed his load, and itâ€™s been really hard for me too.â€ [normal voice] How do you fuck a girl like that? I donâ€™t understand, Iâ€™ve been fucking women for years. [high-pitched] â€œOh my God, fuck me harder, that feels so amazing, fuck me harderâ€¦â€ [gibberish] â€œThat feels so good, Iâ€™m gonna cum. Oh my God, Iâ€™m gonna kill all your ex-girlfriends, you better call me. [deep voice] You better call me!â€ [high-pitched gibberish] â€œTick tock, tick tock, tick tockâ€¦â€ [gibberish] â€œOh my God, Iâ€™m gonna cum, Iâ€™m gonna kill your mother, [deep voice] Iâ€™m gonna kill your mother, motherfucker!â€ [high-pitched gibberish] â€œOh my God, Iâ€™m gonna kill someone, oh my God, Iâ€™m cumming!â€ You guys are amazing, Iâ€™m Jessica Kirson, thank you so much. Thank you, I love you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

The problems that weâ€™re facing in todayâ€™s world. Johnny Deppâ€™s divorce, Elon Musk buying Twitter, Netflixâ€™s share prices. I thought Iâ€™d do my part to try to help fix this. And what better way than to sing a song. Thank you. So Iâ€™m gonna sing a song tonight, and not just any song. Iâ€™m going to sing a traditional Malaysian songâ€¦ from my homeland. Itâ€™s a song I used to sing to inspire myself when I was younger and first starting to do comedy. The song is called â€œTeenage Dreamâ€ by Katy Perry. Take it away, band.

[Ross] Whatâ€™s the point of the show, Bill? Are you gonna play drums tonight, or whatâ€™s gonna happen? No. Iâ€™m a big believer in not doing your hobby on TV.
[all laugh]
Killing it, having a good time. My name was Lifschultz back then, they had to use a smaller font. And how was doing comedy in the fifties? It was good, it was good. Youâ€™re gonna let him get away with that? Come on, look at that blazer. I didnâ€™t realize you were gonna be dressed as a ventriloquist dummyâ€™s dummy. If this was an improv group, what would it be called? The â€œNo Money Backs,â€ orâ€¦? Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m trying to Lipton our way through this. Donâ€™t you have to change the battery by now? Honestly, this is really going on.

Norm was working hard preparing material for his Netflix special â€“ until COVID shut things down.
In the summer of 2020, he was scheduled to undergo a procedure and as he put it, â€œdidnâ€™t want to leave anything on the table in case things went south.â€
At home, the night before going in, he shot this â€“ in one take.
[Lori Jo] Talk, talk.
Hello there, everybody. That sounds good to meâ€¦
[Lori Jo] Okay.
â€¦through my earphonesâ€¦
[Lori Jo] All right. Good.
[Lori Jo] The boomâ€™s a little loud. Iâ€™ll turn that down. Just give me a second.
[dog barking]
[Norm] Lori Jo. Do you like where my hand comes in?
[Lori Jo] Iâ€™m not watching the camera.
Oh. Okay.
[Lori Jo] Testing, testing.
[Norm] Testing, testing.
[Norm] We donâ€™t know whereâ€¦
[Lori Jo] You were talking aboutâ€¦
[Norm] I know where.
[Norm] Okay.
Hey, everybody. Itâ€™s Norm Macdonald. And this is my comedy special. Thatâ€™s right. Now, of course Iâ€™m looking forward to getting back out there, you know. Seeing you folks in person, you know. I love doing gigs. And I miss it. My God, I miss it. Especially casinos. Those were my favorite gigs because Iâ€™m a degenerate gambler as it turns out.
I think the casinos know that. Often theyâ€™ll pay me in chips. Which I findâ€¦ thatâ€™s not nice, you know? Sometimes theyâ€™ll just give me a real big chip. Theyâ€™ll go, â€œHere you go!â€ Then they break it in half. They go, â€œHave fun!â€ I go, â€œGoddamn, guys.â€ Thatâ€™s not nice.
But, anyways, I prefer the Indian casinos. Thatâ€™s what I like. You know? Because I donâ€™t want to give my moneyâ€¦ If Iâ€™m gonna lose money, and Iâ€™m gonna lose money, I donâ€™t want to do it in Las Vegas to a bunch of corporate businessmen. I would rather go to an Indian casino and lose it to the Native Americans. You know? On account of my forefathers systematically murdered them years ago. Which looking back on itâ€¦ way out of line. Way out of line.
Anyways, I look at it as a form of reparations. You know? I tell you, Iâ€™ve done my part, Goddamn it. Probably done your part too.
Anywaysâ€¦ I love casinos. I was in Las Vegas, the last time I was thereâ€¦ People go to Vegas sometimes and they got a system. You know? They go, â€œI got a system, Iâ€™m gonna break the bank â€™cause I figured out a system.â€ And oftentimes these systems actually do not work at all. And I think that I saw the unraveling of a system. Sometimes all you need to hear is like a snippet of conversation and you can infer from that information, more. You know what Iâ€™m saying?
For instance, one time I walked past these two homeless guys. One guy said to the other, â€œWhen the fuck were you ever goaltender for the Montreal Canadians?â€
He was tired of the horseshit. It was the last straw. But anyways, I think I heard what was the unraveling of a system. On account of I got in the elevator, it was going down, and then a couple got on, a man and a woman. And then tension, you know? So it was just the four of us. And weâ€™re going down the elevator. Out of the blue, out of nowhere, the man says to the woman, â€œI donâ€™t give a fuck what I said, give me the money.â€ â€œThatâ€™s my money.â€ So I believe, Iâ€™m only inferring, once again, I have no proof that thatâ€¦
But hereâ€™s the thing about gambling. Itâ€™s irrational, you know? You gottaâ€“ you canâ€™t be rational to actually gamble, because it doesnâ€™t make no sense, you know? And I remember I was at theâ€“ one time I gotâ€¦ I wentâ€“ I was walking down and I saw a roulette table. Now, I donâ€™t know if you know the game of roulette. How could you not know the game of roulette? [laughs] Itâ€™s not that hard. But anyways, I put a hundred dollars on black. You know? And the little silver ball spun around the wheel and everything, and then it landed on red. This is what I said, â€œFuck, I almost picked that!â€
But I do miss being out on the road, you know? Seeing you folks live, you know? I mean, Iâ€™m all alone looking in the TV. It doesnâ€™t make much sense. But whatâ€“ thatâ€™s what it is.
You know, Iâ€™ll tell you one thing I donâ€™t miss is airplanes. I donâ€™t like airplanes. I finally figured out why. After years of therapy I figured out why I donâ€™t care for the airplanes. I donâ€™t like the crashing and dying in the airplane. Thatâ€™s what it is. You know?
Hey, by the way, I got a little tip for you if you fly on an airplane. Always pick the exit row. Choose the exit row. That way you get the extra two, three inches of legroom. And all you have to do to get the exit row is to lie. Thatâ€™s right. You just lie. You know? The stewardess comes up. Flight attendant! [laughs] Flight attendant. I apologize. Words are different now. When I was young, if you were a flight attendant, and you were a lady, we would call you a stewardess. And, if you were a flight attendant and you were a man, we would call you aâ€¦ Wait, what? What are you guys thinking? Good Lord! Whatâ€™s wrong with you? Iâ€™m outraged. Iâ€™m outraged, I tell you. Iâ€™m outraged at what you are thinking just â€™cause I pause for a second. I was going to say a steward. If you were a flight attendant and you were a male, we used to call you a steward. You know?
But words have changed, folks. Thatâ€™s the way things go, man. They are always gonna be different. You know, words, they change. Thatâ€™s why I canâ€™t understand goddamn Shakespeare. You know? I remember one time when I was a little boy, I went up to my dad. I said, â€œDad, I think Iâ€™m a little girl.â€ And he said, â€œI thought you had a cock.â€ I was like, â€œOh, yeah. You got me.â€
Now, the only reason I tell you that is to show how hateful we were back then. You know what Iâ€™m saying? My dadâ€“ now, every person knows that people are nuanced. Theyâ€™re not all evil or all good. You know? My dad did good stuff, you know? He was in the Second World War. You know, he fought Hitler. I mean, he had help. It wasnâ€™t like he had a fistfight with Hitler. But Iâ€™m saying he liberated us from what could have been the icy grip of Nazism. How about that? So that was his good side, you know? His evil side was this crazy idea he had that having a cock had something to do with being a boy. I donâ€™t even know where he could come up with such an idea. Nowadays, we canâ€™t even wrap our heads around that kind of thinking. But people used to actually think that. Isnâ€™t that something?
Now, in other ways, my father was very progressive. For instance, we had a gender neutral bathroom. You know? I used it, my brother used it, my sister used it, my mother used it. Anybody. It didnâ€™t matter what gender you were.
You know what I was way ahead on? Slut-shaming. I was always, always against that. I remember telling the fellas in high school, Iâ€™d go, â€œGuys, I think weâ€™re making a big mistake by shaming the sluts.â€ You see, hereâ€™s what is my concern. I feel if we shame them too much they might stop becoming sluts. You know? And further ladies might not want to be sluts either. I have a different idea. Other than shaming the sluts, itâ€™s a different, itâ€™s a bold idea, I say we take the sluts and we put them on our shoulders. And we go, â€œOh, hail the slut!â€
â™ª For sheâ€™s a jolly good slut â™ª
That kind of thing, you know? So I was way ahead of it, man, way ahead of it.
But anyway, thatâ€™s not what I was talking about. What the hell was I talking about? Oh, yeah, the airplane. Yes, yes, the airplane.
Man, I donâ€™t understand it, you know? They make all their announcements, you know? What are they? Why do they think we still believe that horseshit? You know? I heard one. I guess I just zone out because I havenâ€™t heard it before. They say, â€œIf your oxygen masks happen to fall, make sure to put your oxygen mask on first before you put the oxygen mask of the little boy.â€ And then, Iâ€™d go, â€œYeah, that was my fucking plan. You didnâ€™t have to tell everybody, blabbermouth.â€
I donâ€™t know why they think weâ€™re going to believe them. Theyâ€™ll say, â€œListenâ€¦ I know weâ€™re flying over the Pacific Ocean, but donâ€™t worry, on account of if we happen to crash into the Pacific ocean, the seat cushions are not only seat cushions, they are also boats.â€ Yep, theyâ€™re boats. All the time, you turn on the TV and the guy goes, â€œWell, a plane crashed in the Atlantic, but itâ€™s all right, everybody listened to that lady so theyâ€™re all on their boats.â€
People are going, â€œGoddamn, whyâ€™d I buy that boat? I should have just got a fleet of seat cushions. I would have saved all kinds of money.â€
[small chuckle]
Hereâ€™s the thing. If you crash, letâ€™s be honest for a second. If you crash in an airplane, you got zero chance of survival. Theyâ€™ll take pictures of crash sites, take videos. You know? And they donâ€™t even see anything. Because at that point you become just dematerialized. You know? Youâ€™re nothing, youâ€™re stuff, basically. â€œAshes to ashes, stuff to stuff,â€ as the Scriptures say.
You know? And, uhâ€¦ and then the victims, theyâ€™re called remains, you know, but stuff. And the victimsâ€™ families always want the remains. They go, â€œOh, I canâ€™t go to sleep because I keep thinking of poor Kevin and his last moments on this Earth. Spiraling downwards towards certain death. Oh! Oh, if only I could see his remains. Then Iâ€™d have a good sleep. Oh, Iâ€™d sleep soundly that night. Then I get closure and just forget this whole thing.â€
I donâ€™t understand it, but thatâ€™s what they say. And really, do you think youâ€™re going to get Kevin if youâ€™re Kevinâ€™s mother? Do you think theyâ€™re going to go on a plane and go, â€œHey, look at that. Look over there. Doesnâ€™t that look like Kevinâ€™s hair? That lock of golden blondeâ€“ That looks like Kevinâ€™s hair.â€ â€œFred, didnâ€™t you see Kevinâ€™s thigh bone earlier? Letâ€™s reconstruct him.â€
No, thatâ€™s not what they do. You know? Best thing they can do, maybe theyâ€™ll find your ID. â€œLook, it says Norm Macdonald. It says he weighs 190 pounds. Okay, shovel 190 pounds of stuff into a bag and write Norm on the side of that one, and hurry up. Daylightâ€™s burning and his mother wants it.â€
Then my mother gets it. â€œOh, look at that! Thatâ€™s Norm. How about that? I donâ€™t remember Norm having three ears. Oh, well. I guess none of us really knew him when you get down to it.â€
The only time it seems you ever survive an airplane crash is if you crash into the Andes. You know? Thatâ€™s even worse. Because, you know, youâ€“ then you have to fight with the moral quandary of cannibalism. Which I am against, by the way. If you know anything about my work, you will know my tireless devotion to the anti-cannibalism cause. But Iâ€™m not going to use this as a bully pulpit. Most of you are adults and youâ€™ve cemented your views on cannibalism. I like to go for the kids, you know? The young people. I go all across this great country, and I go to the schools and I talk to the children, you know? And I tell them, I go, â€œListenâ€¦ you might think itâ€™s cool to eat your buddy in Algebra class. Iâ€™m not going to lie to you, you will be the talk of the school for a few years, but what about the future? What about the future?â€ I tell them.
Hereâ€™s the problem with crashing in the Andes and having to resort to cannibalism is they take so long to decide. You know what I mean? They go, â€œOh, I donâ€™t want to eat a guy! Oh, I canâ€™t do it.â€ You know? And, uhâ€¦ â€œI canâ€™t eat the copilot, I canâ€™t do it.â€ You know? And then days go by, I go, â€œHey, maybe we should eat the copilot.â€ You know? And, uhâ€¦ finally, they are maddened by hunger and they just attackâ€¦ [screams] And they got copilot blood all over them, copilot viscera falling out of their mouth on their pink shirts, you know?
Andâ€¦ thatâ€™s no way to eat. You canâ€™t gorge. Any dietician will tell you. You cannot gorge. The thing to do is graze. Thatâ€™s the right way to eat. You know? You wake up, you have a small meal of copilot. Then, around lunchtime, you have a small meal of copilot. Then, around I think about six times during the whole day, you have a small portion of copilot.
Any dietician will tell you, I tell you, not that Iâ€™m a dietician. I donâ€™t pretend to be a dietician. Well, sometimes I do, butâ€¦ itâ€™s only to get the ladies, you know? The big fat ladies. I go up, I go, â€œHey, you want to go on a diet? On account of Iâ€™m a dietician.â€ And then they leave with me sometimes. Sometimes they just get angry, you know? I donâ€™t know.
But, I donâ€™t even know what I was talking about. Werenâ€™t we talking about slut-shaming? I donâ€™t know. Nobody knows anymore.
Oh, I know, yes, the airplane! Yes. You know, youâ€¦ this is the thing. You gotta be ready for anything life throws you in this here world. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned as Iâ€™ve aged. You know? And Iâ€™m ready. Like cannibalism? I know what I would do in the Andes on account of Iâ€™ve thought it over. Iâ€™ve thought over my position. You see what I mean? Like I flew in from Vegas, I remember, one time, and there was some turbulence. And I was like, â€œIâ€™m eating that fucking fourteen yearâ€“â€œ
[dog barking]
The thing is, you got to be ready. You got to be ready for anything this world throws at you. You know? And, you knowâ€¦ and I am, you know? Like, I remember one time I was flying from Vegas to LA and there was a little turbulence, and I remember I said, â€œIâ€™m going to eat that fucker in 14-A.â€ Oh, that guy looked delicious. [smacks lips] Big fat guy! [laughs]
But, anyways, enough of this grim nonsense. You know what I mean? We got problems in this country. For instance, systematic racism. And hereâ€™s the problem, nobody thinks theyâ€™re racist. I remember I was in Portland one time. Portland, Oregon. And the driver picked me up to take me to the gig. I got off the airplane, the driverâ€™s driving. And weâ€™re driving through downtown Portland and he says, â€œYou know, we got no racists in Portland. No racism at all.â€ And I looked around, everyone was white. You know? [chuckles] So I said to the guy, I said, â€œWell, itâ€™s pretty easy not be racist when everybodyâ€™s white.â€ And then the guy says to me, he goes, â€œWe got our share.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œGood Lord!â€ â€œWe got our share.â€ Thatâ€™s not right.
Why are allâ€“ not all, but a lot of drivers for some reason, like taxi drivers and something, turn out to be racists, you know? Thatâ€™s what I hear a lot of, â€™cause I donâ€™t drive, so Iâ€™ll get in a cab and the guyâ€™ll go, â€œYou know whatâ€™s wrong with this country, donâ€™t you?â€ And I go, â€œI got an idea. So what is it?â€
You ever have it when the guy says it and you donâ€™t even know which race it is? Like I had a guy once, he goes, â€œYou know whatâ€™s the problem in this country?â€ I go, â€œTell me.â€ He goes, â€œToo many goddamn scuddleheads.â€ I was like, â€œHuh?â€
So I looked it up in the dictionary, in Wikipedia. Everywhere. I found scuddle. I found head. And I tried to put them together. I couldnâ€™t understand it. Iâ€™ve asked people of every race. And no one has ever heard of the term â€œscuddlehead.â€
By the way, I would be fine if we just blamed all our problems on the scuddleheads. You know what I mean? Just make them the scapegoats. Why not? As a matter of fact, why not make the goats the scapegoats? Like in the old days. Yeah, sacrifice a goat. Make it his problem. Heâ€™sâ€“ thatâ€™s the one thatâ€™s at fault. That goat eating a tin can.
But anyways, Iâ€™m not here to talk about goats. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m here. [soft chuckle] You know what Iâ€™ve noticed lately? Everybody has an opinion. And I, you know, when I was young, it wasnâ€™t that way, you know? People would have maybe, I donâ€™t know, six opinions. You know? Sometime youâ€™d meet a guy, heâ€™d have eight opinions. Youâ€™d go, â€œGoddamn! That guyâ€™s opinionated!â€
But about six opinionsâ€¦ and most of them were about food, you know? To tell you the truth. People would go, â€œCount Chocula? What the fuckâ€™s wrong with you?â€ Stuff like that.
You know, I mean, I have opinionsâ€¦ I mean, I have opinions that everybody holds. You know? Like, I donâ€™t know. Yellowâ€™s the best color. You know? I donâ€™t know if youâ€™d call that an opinion. Itâ€™s just aâ€¦
[phone ringing]
Oh, hold on, itâ€™s my phone.
[phone continues ringing]
Hello. I got to phone you back on account of Iâ€™m doing a special. On the TV. Comedy special. So Iâ€™ll call you back, okay? Okay.
Sorry about that, guys.
Anyways, I was saying, I donâ€™t got really no opinions and I know a lot of people donâ€™t have opinions on account of I see it on the TV. Like, Iâ€™ll watch CNN and theyâ€™ll ask a question. Sometimes itâ€™s tough. Theyâ€™ll say, â€œWhat do you think of that Southeast Asian sea treaty? How do you think thatâ€™ll affect the gross national product of Singapore?â€ Andâ€¦ Anyways, at the end they ask that question. â€œDo you think itâ€™s good, yes or no?â€ And then at the end they show the answer. Iâ€™m a sucker for a poll. So, I always like toâ€“ I take, you know, I take part inâ€¦ at the end you always see the same thing. Itâ€™ll be like, theyâ€™ll show the poll and itâ€™s in like a pie chart. Youâ€™ll go, â€œGoddamn! I wish I had some pie!â€ Anyway, they show a pie chart and it will be like 45 percent yes. 45 percent no. Ten percent: â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
So thatâ€™s fine, you know? Iâ€™m not ashamed of being part of the ten percent. You know? Sounds small, but ten percent of this great country, thatâ€™s 35 million people that donâ€™t know. Thatâ€™s fine.
And Iâ€™m a sucker, man, I alwaysâ€¦ anytime I see one of those polls, I phone up. I go, â€œHello, is this the TV? Yeah, you asked a question earlier. I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know the answer to the question. Listen, I got a question for you. What did that second word mean, anyway? It did? [chuckles] All right, I better end up in that poll that looks like a pie, fella. Iâ€™m no sap.â€ And then I hang upâ€¦ my phone.
But, I tell you, man, you got to, especially when elections are around, you got to have a lot ofâ€¦ When youâ€™re a comedian, they expect you to know things nowadays. You know what I mean? It didnâ€™t used to be like that. During the Vietnam War, they wouldnâ€™t go, â€œI wonder what Red Skelton thinks on this.â€ But nowadays, Iâ€™ve heardâ€“ they go, â€œA comedian is the modern-day philosopher.â€ You know? First of all, it always makes me feel sad for the actual modern-day philosophers who exist, you know? Theyâ€™re working, trying to come up with their philosophy and they go, â€œGoddamn! You ever hear of this night club comic? Heâ€™s doing some very good work on â€˜totaligism'â€ or what the hellâ€¦ [chuckles] Whatever you sayâ€¦
Iâ€™ll tell you, when the election cycle starts, this is what Iâ€™ve noticed. Theyâ€™re very difficult. Because they are trying to get the people that are smart, that know things. The people that know, because they are 90 percent, remember? I donâ€™t know people are only ten percent. So, they will try to get you with very hard, very difficult commercials. Iâ€™ve seen them, you know? Like, a guy will come on TV, or a lady, and say, you know, â€œIf you want to hear how I will fix healthcare as well as the mass of student debt problem in this country, as well as keeping our borders secure, but still being compassionate, then please go on â€˜www.mynameâ€™ and I have a 45-page position paper.â€ Then I go, â€œOh, noâ€¦ I will not be doing that.â€ Iâ€™ll tell you why, itâ€™s nothing against you. You seem like a fine enough fella, Itâ€™s just that I cannot read your 45-page position paper on account of, earlier today, a guy told me that I only get the one life. Soâ€¦ What are you gonnaâ€¦ I still got half a box full of Matlock. Matlock box sets. You only got so much time, you got to choose. You know? You got to choose.
But later on, man, when you get closer to the election, hereâ€™s what always happens, Iâ€™ve noticed. Whenever you get close to an election, they go, â€œThereâ€™s only three days left till the election,â€ and itâ€™s always tied. You know, and they go, â€œYou know what we have to get? Those people that donâ€™t know anything.â€ Itâ€™s a very odd way of choosing the leader of the free world, but thatâ€™s the best we got. And they go, â€œWe gotta get those guys that donâ€™tâ€“â€œ
Then the commercials become very tough. Nothing about the sea of Japan or anything like that. Thereâ€™s a guy thatâ€™ll come on TV and go, â€œHey, listen, let me ask you a question. Do you like yellow?â€ And I go, â€œYeah, of course I like yellow.â€ And he goes, â€œYeah, well so does this guy.â€ And they show a guy waving, pointing at someone that doesnâ€™t exist. Wearing a yellow shirt, you know? Then I go, â€œRuth, get out here! Goddamn! Hereâ€™s a guy on the TV thatâ€™s speaking for me finally. Ruth! You know how Iâ€™m always talking about how cool yellow is? Well, this motherfuckerâ€¦ finally, a person thatâ€™s speaking not at me, but for me.â€
You know what I read, actually? They say that the reason you vote for people is you vote for the guy youâ€™d most like to have a beer with. I know that sounds odd, but itâ€™s true. They vote for presidents by who you would most enjoy having a beer with. But what I find even more interesting is that no one has ever used that to their political advantage. If it was me, that would be my whole campaign. That would be the spine of it. Beer! You know what I mean? Everywhere I went Iâ€™d be holding a glass of beer. You know what I mean? My slogan would beâ€¦ â€œAh!â€ And Iâ€™d hold up my beer. Iâ€™d go, â€œAh!â€ â€œYou like beer?â€ [laughs] â€œMe, too! Vote for me and then you can come to the White House andâ€¦ Ah!â€
[chuckles]
Goddamn, Iâ€™m getting old. You can tell, I donâ€™t have to tell you that. I like wearing these on account of it hides all my white hair and everything like that. I donâ€™t want to get my hair colored no more, you know? I donâ€™t want anybody painting my hair black. On account of I donâ€™t want to die and then be surprised. You know what I mean? Go, â€œGoddamn, I look good.â€ And the guy goes, â€œWell, I made your hair white. What do you think that was all about? I was telling you to get your affairs in order, for Godâ€™s sake.â€
But anyway, I tell you how you know youâ€™re growing old is when you start checking your left arm status. You go, â€œGoddamn, my left arm, I feel a little odd.â€
[chuckles]
Thatâ€™s all I know about medicine. If your left arm feels odd, you will either have an impending heart attack, or nothing at all will happen.
I like doctors. I like specialists, though, you know? Like, letâ€™s sayâ€¦ this is what I donâ€™t understand. Your foot hurts, so you want to go to the foot doctor. You phone the foot doctor, he goes, â€œI canâ€™t come, you got to go to a regular doctor.â€ Then you go to the regular doctor and he goes, â€œYeah, you got to go to a foot doctor. Just pay Agnes 80 bucks on the way out.â€ What is that scam? You know? You go, â€œAll right.â€ He goes, â€œWhile youâ€™re here, you want me to take your blood pressure?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, thatâ€™s fine. Iâ€™ve had my blood pressure taken about five thousand times.â€ I donâ€™t even know what it means. They go, â€œItâ€™s 150 over 60.â€ I go, â€œIs that good?â€ They go, â€œAh, I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s all a blur. Iâ€™m a doctor. Iâ€™m going to be hitting your knee with a hammer now.â€
Thatâ€™s the oddest one to me of all time. We havenâ€™t got past that? Thatâ€™s like a cartoon from the 1950s. Guy pulls out a hammer, hits your knee with it, you go, â€œAh, my knee! Oh, my God, that hurts!â€ And the guy writes down: â€œExcellent. Very good. Thatâ€™s exactly how you should react when your knee is struck by a hammer.â€
Sometimes doctors just know smart words. You ever see those guys? One time, I remember I was real tired. I had this thing, I donâ€™t know what it was. I say, â€œHey, Doc, I got this thing, Iâ€™m real tired.â€ He goes, â€œSounds like chronic fatigue syndrome to me.â€ I said, â€œReally, whatâ€™s that?â€ He says, well, â€œChronic means always, and fatigue means tired. And syndrome, that means something you got.â€ Anyway, you can pay Agnes 80 bucks on the way out.
Who knows what these doctors mean with their medical gobbledygook. Guy told me yesterday, the doc, he said, Iâ€™m now more of a virus than a host. What does that even mean? Who knows?
Hereâ€™s the problem. You go to doctors too much, they start thinking youâ€™re a hypochondriac and then they donâ€™t take anything seriously, you know?
Word gets around with these guys. Small community, the doctor community. And I made the mistake of one timeâ€¦ one timeâ€¦ I had a Pap smear. Guy smeared my pap, you know? It turned out good. But then word got out that I was a hypochondriac. But Iâ€™m not a hypochondriac. I only think I am.
My friend who does have a medical issue, itâ€™s terrible, heâ€™s 586 pounds. Not a lie. Now, Iâ€™ve been blessed to have the same friends since I was in grade four. Billy, Jimmy, Ricky, me. Now, we all went our different paths, but Jimmy became fat, then he became really fat, then he became obese, then he became morbidly obese. And now, 586 pounds. Itâ€™s incredible. Heâ€™s one of those guys that canâ€™t get out of his house and stuff. But heâ€™s finally decided to change, thank God. So heâ€™s got a psychiatrist in there, we got him a dietician, people are around the clock. One of the three of us go and visit him and keep his spirits up. And itâ€™s great.
But he said something that struck me odd the other day. Last time I saw him, which was about six months ago. The other day. But he said to me, he said, â€œNorm, you wouldnâ€™t believe it, but at one point in my life I weighed 135 pounds.â€ And I said, â€œOh, no, I believe that. I think you weighed every weight up to 586 pounds. I donâ€™t think you just showed up looking like this.â€
[sighs]
My other friend was mentally retarded. Now, I know youâ€™re not supposed to say that anymore. But thatâ€™s what we said then. You know? I understand that term. It means that youâ€™re arrested. Youâ€™re mental capacity has been retarded or arrested. So, anyways, Iâ€™ll say Downâ€™s syndrome, I donâ€™t care. I didnâ€™t say it for a long time on account of I thought people would think I was a doctor. And Iâ€™d have to hit their knee with a hammer or something. I donâ€™t know.
But anyways, I loveâ€“ my best friend had Downâ€™s syndrome, you know? I love people with Downâ€™s syndrome. I wish I had Downâ€™s syndrome. Iâ€™ll tell you why. â€˜Cause theyâ€™re happy. You know what I mean? They are happy! Whatâ€™s wrong with that? Man, I wish I was happy, you know? I was happy when I was with my friend, Iâ€™ll tell you that. I would love to have a friend right now. â€˜Cause how often are you happy? You ever be happy? It happens once in a while, you know. With me, itâ€™s usually when I wake up. I wake up, I go, â€œAh! Goddamn. Iâ€™m glad I bought that Tempur-Pedic pillow. [chuckles] That was the best purchase I ever made.â€
But then the light comes under the door, and bathes over you. Then your life comes in and gets all over you like a cobweb. Youâ€™re like, â€œGoddamn. Thatâ€™s not fun.â€
You ever go in the mirror and look at yourself? Iâ€™m not talking about physically. Just eye to eye. And then you go, â€œGood God, whatâ€™s become of me? [shudders] Iâ€™m going to go back to bed and cover myself up.â€ [shudders] Thatâ€™s when I would like to have a mentally retarded friend next to me. A guy with Downâ€™s syndrome to go, â€œI like bananas!â€ I go, â€œGoddamn, I never looked at it that way. I like bananas too.â€ He goes, â€œTheyâ€™re yellow!â€ â€œGoddamn, youâ€™re right, they are yellow. Ha! What say you and me go buy a yellow banana?â€
See, people get mad at me and yet they pity them! I envy people with Downâ€™s syndrome. You know? They pity them. Now, whoâ€™s the bad person in that scenario? I tell you right now, man, if there was some sort of injection where I could be Downâ€™s syndrome, Iâ€™d take it because Iâ€™d love to be happy all the time. You know? Some people go, â€œOh, mentally retarded people arenâ€™t always happy.â€ I go, â€œWell, I never seenâ€¦â€ You know? You ever see a cynical Downâ€™s syndrome guy? You know? Ever see a guy go, â€œFuck bananas, theyâ€™re yellow. I donâ€™t care. Who cares?â€ I never seen them.
But, happiness. The thing we strive the most. People pity these people that have it. Theyâ€™ll look over at a group of people with Downâ€™s syndrome and go, â€œOh, man, look. Breaks my heart when I see them. You know why? Theyâ€™re happy, right? Itâ€™s on account of they donâ€™t understand lifeâ€™s horrors. Makes me sad, makes me shake my head sadly like this here. And you know the saddest part of all? Thereâ€™s no cure. Theyâ€™ll probably die happy.â€
Anyways, I hope you guys are all doing well. Iâ€™m glad I got my wife, you know, Ruth. Sheâ€™s all right, you know? Sheâ€™s watching a lot of TV. Sheâ€™s got her guilty pleasures, you know? And her guilty pleasure is watching Housewives Of Atlanta. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever seen that. My guilty pleasure is finding elderly gentlemen and shooting them in the leg. No, thatâ€™sâ€¦ thatâ€™s just a joke. That is a joke! I felt it was time I tell a joke. I think it may be in my contract.
Anywaysâ€¦ my wife, man, she ainâ€™t the brightest girl, Ruth. We have whatâ€™s called a hall pass. You know what that is? A hall pass? That means youâ€™re allowed to have sex with any two people that you would like to have sex with because theyâ€™re special. I choseâ€“ and the other partner has to agree to it. So I chose on my hall pass Angelina Jolie and Christie Brinkley. And Ruth, my wife, sheâ€™s so stupid that, you know who she chose? The Mexican guy that mows my lawn and his brother. Of all the people in the world, of all the people in the world.
But I love women, you know? I consider women to be superior to men and Iâ€™ll tell you why. They create life. Think about that. You know what I mean? What do men do? Maybe they eat sour cream and onion chips or something. Women create life for Godâ€™s sakes. Itâ€™s amazing. You know what Iâ€™m saying?
If I was a woman, thatâ€™s all Iâ€™d do, just create life. Iâ€™d go to parties and go, â€œHey, Fred. What do you do? I canâ€™t remember.â€ And Fred would go, â€œIâ€™ll tell you what I do, Loretta.â€ Thatâ€™s my name in the story. Heâ€™d go, â€œIâ€™ll tell you what I do, Loretta. I think you know I work down at the bank for Mr. Abernathy. Andâ€¦ I, well, whatâ€¦ my main job is Abernathy will give me a stack of papers about this big. By the end of the day, if I get them down to about this big, thatâ€™s a goodâ€“â€œ
I go, â€œWait a second there. Iâ€™m sorry. I got to stop you there. Remember how I was telling you how I create life? Human life. The highest form of life. I just got to tell you this. That life just kicked me. Can you possibly wrap your head around that?â€ And heâ€™ll go, â€œAh! Well, Iâ€¦ Look. Abernathyâ€™s never given me that corner office like he promised. And there was plenty of lunches where he brought it up. Ah! But then Henderson showed up. That all changed. Who am I kidding? I should just quit.â€
Anyways, what have we learned from this little fable?
[chuckles]
Itâ€™s funny now, hereâ€™s what I was thinking ofâ€¦ You know how everybodyâ€™s got a name now? Everybody has an identity, you know? Like, letâ€™s say, your sexuality. Letâ€™s say a guy likes a guy. Thatâ€™s a homosexual. If you are attracted to a member of your own gender. If youâ€™re attracted to a member of the opposite sex then youâ€™re a heterosexual. But what about a guy like me? Just whacks off all the time? What am I? I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve got a word.
This is why I was thinking about whacking off. Think about this. Itâ€™s kind of like a psychotic break you got to do. You know? Like, in your mind, in your picture, you have to have a picture there of you with a lady and you got to believe it so much that you donâ€™t even believe whatâ€™s really happening. You know what Iâ€™m getting at?
I donâ€™t know, like, a lot of guysâ€¦ I donâ€™t have a great imagination. A lot of guys will do it with aâ€¦ Playboy magazine, say. Or maybe a Victoriaâ€™s Secret, or something like that. But I ainâ€™t got the imagination for that, you know what I mean? Like, I try, you know, but then Iâ€™ll go, â€œOkay, you come over here with your â€˜Victoria Secrets.â€™ Huh? Iâ€™ll show you your underwear.â€ I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m mean to them, butâ€¦ Iâ€™ll go, â€œWhy donâ€™t you come over and take off your underwear?â€ They go, â€œNo, Iâ€™m not doing that.â€ And I go, â€œNo, Iâ€¦ goodbye! I didnâ€™t think you would. Sorry about that crack about asking you to take your underwear off.â€
Butâ€¦ I donâ€™t have the imagination for that. However, there is this lady that works down the street from me at 7-11. Sheâ€™s not much to look at, but she likes me. Thatâ€™s the important thing. In that way, in that certain way that women like men. And I know she likes me on account of one time I was buying sour cream and onion chips and Vanilla Swiss Almond ice cream, and Iâ€™m getting it, right, and she goes, â€œI like sour cream and onion chips, too.â€ I go, â€œYeah, thatâ€™s interesting.â€ She goes, â€œNo, I really like them.â€ Now I look up, Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ Because sometimes the shadow of the thing is bigger than theâ€¦
Anywaysâ€¦ I knew that she liked me. So then, for the next two months Iâ€™m whacking off. Oh, my God. Now, in my head is me and the girlâ€¦ I donâ€™t think any guy could just, in his head, have himself whacking off. That wouldnâ€™t work. Iâ€™m only talking about men. â€˜Cause Iâ€™ve asked women. Iâ€™ve said, â€œWhat do you do when you lie with yourself and make your finger a blur like a hummingbirdâ€™s wing? What do you think of in your head?â€ And then they go, â€œOh, a hammock.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œOh!â€
So anyways, theyâ€™re a little more advanced. But we have to think of a specific scenario. So my scenario is the lady from 7-11, I go, â€œHey! Theyâ€™re giving you a break. Iâ€™ll show you a break. Come on over here.â€
My jokes donâ€™t even make sense. Anyways, I get â€™emâ€¦ What Iâ€™m interested in is in the moment when the fever breaks. You know what I mean? When that four seconds of issue that you spent so much time going after, it ends. You know what I mean? Youâ€™re thinking of all these things in your head. You just got a psychotic break going that would rival a paranoid schizophrenic. All of a sudden it stops and youâ€™re like, â€œAh!â€ Itâ€™s just me. There are no ladies at all. Itâ€™s just me. [panting] I got to get a hold of myself. Whatâ€™ll I do here? I know. Iâ€™ll go downstairs. Iâ€™ll get a cheese sandwich. [chuckles] Yeah. Iâ€™ll never think about this again. [chuckles] Thatâ€™s right. [chuckles]
Iâ€™ll be honest with you. Sometimes I feel bad about doing that. Self-abuse, you know, lying down with myself. On account ofâ€¦ because Iâ€™m a Christian. You know? But, Iâ€™ll tell you this, a lot of people think Christians are self-righteous. But weâ€™re not, weâ€™re sinning all the time. All the time. For instanceâ€¦ I eat apples. Think about that for a second. Itâ€™s on page one. Worst thing you can do in the world. Iâ€™m munching down on an apple. Ah! You know? Sure, I love apples, butâ€¦ is it worth getting raped by the Devil for all of time? I say no!
Anywaysâ€¦ I know thereâ€™s a God. People go, â€œWell, youâ€™re only a Christian because you grew up in a Christianâ€“â€ And I understand that and thatâ€™s one of my biggest fears. That I picked the wrong religion, you know? That I believed, but then I died and I go, â€œAh! Itâ€™s you! I thought it was the other fella. Ah!â€ I should have been slaying apostates the entire time. Oh well, what are you going to do?
Hey! Did you know this? They finally figured out that Jesus Christ, whether youâ€™re religious or not, that Jesus Christ was actually a historical figure. Probably a historical figure. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s that interesting because itâ€™s only whether he was divine or not that matters.
But they also found, I found this very interesting, they found a new Dead Sea Scroll. And it was a gospel about Jesus H. Christ. It turned out that he was a real guy, you know? He grew up in the town right next to Jesus Christ. So, often he wasâ€“ he had a bad life because people would come up to him and go, â€œHey!â€ â€œMaster, can we touch your hand?â€ And heâ€™d go, â€œIâ€™m not the guy! Iâ€™m a plumber for Godâ€™s sake. Youâ€™re looking for the cabinet maker. Ah!â€ And theyâ€™d go, â€œPlease, Master, let us touch your hand.â€ And heâ€™d go, â€œYou can touch it if you want, but Iâ€™m telling you nothingâ€™s going to happen. I should have just gone with Howard. I donâ€™t like this one bit.â€
Anyways, I thought that was interesting.
But, listen, folks, I donâ€™t want to get depressing, you know? But you got to get a living will, Iâ€™ll tell you that right now. Itâ€™s very important, Iâ€™ll tell you why. Because if you donâ€™tâ€“ Iâ€™ll tell you what a living will is. Itâ€™s if you happen to go into a coma, something like that, the living will tells the doctor what to do. And itâ€™s usually about a plug. A plug in the wall. I hate to bring everybody down, but a lot of you will end up plugged into the wall. Sounds odd, butâ€¦ And Iâ€™m not going to say which one of you because I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s fair. But I made out a very simple one. You know? All itâ€¦ See, hereâ€™s the thing. If you do not make out a living will, you know what happens? You know who decides? Your family. And guess what theyâ€™ll decide? Maybe what they always decide. No, they always decide the same thing. You know? At first they donâ€™t. Because, you know, itâ€™s kind of fun bringing your friends in. Thereâ€™s something lying there, you go, â€œLook at that, huh? Used to have dreams. Now itâ€™s just a gray thing. Oh, well. Used to make apple pies for me.â€
But anyways, the novelty runs out of anything and after a while, you know, of course the family is going to goâ€“ and I know itâ€™s going to be my sister, sheâ€™ll go, â€œOh, yeah, Doc, remember when you were saying, â€˜Did Norm ever discuss what heâ€™d want if he was plugged into a wall?â€™ Well, I donâ€™t know if this counts, but one time I remember we were having lunch and Norm said to me, â€˜You know, if I was ever plugged into a wall then I think that you should, you knowâ€¦ kill me.'â€
And then everybody else in the room goes, â€œI remember him saying that too!â€ And then what if you were in the coma, you can still hear, youâ€™re like, â€œOh, no!â€ But you canâ€™t even get to them. Anyways, what I was going to say is, I donâ€™t even have a plug. I got a whole Byzantine, you know, bunch of different plugs. Surge protectors, all sortsâ€“ because I donâ€™t want some janitor with a wide broom hitting my plug. You know? And then my sister slipping a five to him out in the hallway. I know how things work, Iâ€™ll tell you that. Also, what happens if they go, â€œOkay, letâ€™s pull the plug.â€ Then a guy runs in, â€œI got some great news! Ohâ€¦ did you guys pull the plug?â€ They go, â€œYeah, whatâ€™s the great news?â€ He goes, â€œNothing. No. Nothing at all. Itâ€™s just LeBron James might go to the hall of fame, they say. [laughs] But anyways, you better go home and grieve. You know what one of the best ways of grieving is, they say. Donâ€™t read the newspaper, or look at the internet, or anything. Thatâ€™s what they say.â€
I donâ€™t know, man. Thereâ€™s more in this world than anybody can understand.
Psychology. I donâ€™t understand psychology, Iâ€™ll tell you. I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s real. They say some people got recovered memories. A memory will just come to them, you know? From 30, 40 years ago. Itâ€™s never a good memory. Itâ€™s never like they go, â€œGoddamn, I used to like peach pie. I got to get me a piece of peach pie.â€ Itâ€™s always the most violent, sexual, horrifying incident. You know what I mean? And I donâ€™t like it. I donâ€™t like it.
Because, hereâ€™s the thing with recovered memory. You canâ€™t be sure anymore of what happened. You know? I used to be at parties, and say it with great pride, people would come up to me and go, â€œHey, Norm, did your uncle ever fuck your ass?â€ And Iâ€™d go, â€œNo.â€ And Iâ€™d be happy. I took great pride in that, you know? But now I canâ€™t say that anymore, you know? Because thereâ€™s two possibilities. Either my uncle fucked my ass and I forgot, or he didnâ€™t fuck my ass. So, when people come up to me now and ask me, â€œDid your uncle fuck your ass?â€ All I can say is, â€œI donâ€™t know. Fifty-fifty, I guess.â€ If I understand my advanced math, itâ€™s 50-50.
But I donâ€™t even know if I believe in psychology. You know what I mean? And Iâ€™ll tell you why. Because my friend, everything to this guy has two meanings. You know what I mean? He says, â€œYou know how you have your conscience and your subcoâ€“â€œ
Anyways, one time Iâ€™m with this guy, weâ€™re having dinner, and I take a glass of milk. Iâ€™m drinking the milk. The guy says, â€œHey! You know why youâ€™re drinking that milk, Norm?â€ I go, â€œNo, why?â€ I know somethingâ€™s coming. He goes, â€œThatâ€™s because you miss sucking on your motherâ€™s breast.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œAh!â€ â€œWhat did you have to say that for?â€ And Iâ€™m stuck, you know? What am I gonna guzzle the milk? Thereâ€™s a delicious cold milk there. You know? And you guys donâ€™t know my mother, but sheâ€™s 84 years old, for God sakes. Sheâ€™s a sweet lady and everything, butâ€¦
You know what? I was thinking about my mother the other day because, you know the #MeToo movement and the Timeâ€™s Up movement and all that? This is a moveâ€“ Iâ€™ve never seenâ€“ Iâ€™ve never been through a revolution like this. Itâ€™s very exciting, you know, to see women get what theyâ€™ve always deserved in the first place, you know? But every revolution has its casualties. And for me, itâ€™s people like my mother. Or maybe you have a mother or a grandmother. Itâ€™s those people. I remember growing up with my mother. Sheâ€™d be cooking, sheâ€™d be in the kitchen. â€œDo you have enough gravy? Oh! Thereâ€™s some more turkey. Oh, the turnips! The turnips!â€ Sheâ€™d get the turnips out. Then Iâ€™d go, â€œMa, you got enough to eat?â€ Sheâ€™d go, â€œOh, yes.â€ But sheâ€™d just be eating what was left from us, you know what I mean? And weâ€™d go, â€œCan we help with the dishes?â€ â€œNo, no, watch your football games.â€
I love my mother, you know. She lives right beside me here. Sheâ€™s great. I donâ€™t think my mother has ever spoken a word that had any irony in it. You know what I mean? Sheâ€™s just earnest, sheâ€™s just happy. She knows how to love, she doesnâ€™t judge.
I donâ€™t thinkâ€¦ Sheâ€™ll go sometimes to the grocery store and come back, the other day she did this. Sheâ€™d come back, sheâ€™d say, â€œA funny thing happened at the grocery store.â€ I said, â€œWhat happened, Mom?â€ She said, â€œA woman came in and bought a grapefruit and it cost $1.69 and last week it cost $1.19.â€ And then I said, â€œThatâ€™s not a story, let alone a funny story. I donâ€™t even think that would be considered a story.â€
Anyways, my point is that I would trade myâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what my point is, really.
Oh, yeah! I know! I donâ€™t want to suck her tits! Thatâ€™s what my point was. Maybe that makes me shallow. I donâ€™t know.
Stay safe, folks. I love you.
I would drop the mic, but I paid for it.
* * *
[laughter]
That was sweet, man.
Holy shit.
Tearjerker ending.
Oh, God.
Yup. I thought of two things. The first thing I thought of was, I might owe Drew Michaels an apology. Because he made a special with no audience and I hated it.
Ah!
Because I looked at it like a swimming meet with no water. Like thatâ€™s the whole thing. But thisâ€¦ was very endearing. It was amazing. Thisâ€¦ [grumbles]
[Letterman] The form is different. Itâ€™s not strictly speaking stand-up. Itâ€™s something else. And the great gift could have been to be in a room full of people when Norm did that for those people. Because that would have evaluated, measured, and directed what heâ€™s talking about. And for us to sit here and look at it is not a true test of anything really other than we all love Norm and, my God, he is certainly prolific. Certainly energetic. But we werenâ€™t watching stand-up comedy because it was impossible. But thereâ€™s something there, for sure.
Thereâ€™s no question.
Yeah.
[Chappelle] I also forget how poetic he is.
Yeah.
With Norm, I didnâ€™t know him that well in the â€™90s. Then when my dad died, I had to do a movie with Norm, and I tried everything to get out of that movie because I was inconsolable. I couldnâ€™t get out of it. And working with him was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. It was like, he was the right guy at the right time. I was inconsolable.
Did he talk to you about your dad a lot? What did he do?
Never came up. He just made me laugh.
[Sandler] Yeah, right, right.
He just, you know, it was wistful, and amusing. You know how Norm is. You never knew if he was setting something up or not. We were just hanging out, all of a sudden itâ€™d be like this punchline out of nowhere, butâ€¦ it started to become like aâ€¦ work was like a church I go to. I couldnâ€™t wait to get to work and hang around this guy.
Yeah. Sweet.
[Chappelle] And I knew he was special.
Yeah.
Andâ€¦ Iâ€™ve known people for years and years that didnâ€™t make me laugh as much as he did in that eight or ten weeks. Heâ€™s like a real special person to me. And the way heâ€™s funny, I just never seen someone get at it like that.
Yeah.
The element that I always admired was the connection to the audience. And his asides, and his looks and his pauses were interpreted exactly the way he knew they would be interpreted and that fueled the ridiculous nature of some of the presentation. And without that audience, you donâ€™t get the full measure of Norm.
Yeah.
It was like the audience was his partner. Everybody was in this together with Norm.
I agree. I like the way you said it. The audience was his partner.
That kind of felt like the gentle Norm that when you would sit and hang out after our shows on the road or weâ€™d be on the bus with him. Heâ€™d still be being funny. He would kind of perform like that. Like, heâ€™d say his material to you, heâ€™d kind of commit to it, but he just kept going and going and going. It looked like he was just like, â€œI want to get everything out. Everything Iâ€™ve been thinking about.â€ Anywaysâ€¦
He had, I think, the best word choice of maybe any comedian Iâ€™ve ever seen. He intentionally mispronounces words.
Yeah.
[Sandler] Thatâ€™s right.
[Oâ€™Brien] When he knowsâ€¦ he knows how to say â€œTVâ€, he says itâ€™s â€œthe TVâ€. He came on our show, I think it was his first appearance, he was talking about a Doberman, and he said itâ€™s a â€œDober-manâ€.
And he knows!
But heâ€™s constantly screwing with you on every level.
[Letterman] Right.
But his word choice, he was like Mark Twain. He had this folksy, completely out-of-timeâ€¦ I donâ€™t know if he was born 300 years too late or 300 years too early, but heâ€™s talking in a wayâ€¦ no one speaks like that. And you really appreciate the way he says things. And his timing.
He talks like a 1930s Canadian dock worker.
Yeah.
Does it remind you a bit of Face In The Crowd? Some of the early stuff where heâ€™s just communicating from himself to a radio audience? Thatâ€™s what I thought of early on in this.
[Oâ€™Brien] Yeah. You know, itâ€™s funny because the way I experienced him, as you did, Dave, was really on the talk show format. And later on, when I would look at the clips of him on my show, I would thinkâ€“ I donâ€™t even know that I needed toâ€“ I was there just laughing. But I was in no wayâ€¦ Heâ€™s totally self-fueled. Yes, itâ€™s nice when you hear the audience there, but heâ€™s alsoâ€¦ you know, what heâ€™s doing is so absurd and ridiculous. This was an exercise inâ€¦ I couldnâ€™t do that if you just put a camera thereâ€¦
[Letterman] No.
â€¦and said youâ€™ve got 50 minutes and go. I would become, I would lose my train of thought, or I wouldâ€“ I need other people there for me to find the next thing. Heâ€™s completelyâ€¦ When I look at his appearances that he did with me, I think, I didnâ€™t need to be there. I mean, Iâ€™m glad I was there. Iâ€™m selfishly glad I was there.
[Spade] You need a second to think. I donâ€™t know if heâ€™s got a set list. Thereâ€™s no really looking down, thereâ€™s no fumbling, thereâ€™s no thinkâ€“ it was just kind of go, go, go. I didnâ€™t see where that would be and to remember all that?
The presentation, considering the circumstance, the presentation was robust for Godâ€™s sake.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like the messiness. I like the dog.
The dog and that phone call.
You were saying the guy without the audience. This is just more, there was no choice. Itâ€™s different when he just has to do it. The other guy picked not to have an audience.
Thatâ€™s absolutely right. I didnâ€™t even think it was possible.
Yeah.
I feel like he landed the trick.
Yeah.
His timing is like a drummerâ€™s.
[all agreeing]
Itâ€™s like a jazz drummer.
What would the timing have been with an audience? Still perfect?
I canâ€™t tell, you know. Heâ€™s so nice with it, I feel like it looked like it was supposed to be that. Itâ€™s hard to explain.
[Sandler] Right, yeah.
This is like listening to a good book on tape.
[Sandler] Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Itâ€™s reallyâ€¦
Yeah, yeah, thatâ€™s good.
It reminds me of what I liked about him. Heâ€™s a soothing person to be around.
[Sandler] Yeah, gentle, gentle.
My favorite comedy makesâ€“ is kind of intuitive. It makes people feel safe, like everythingâ€™s going to be all right.
[Sandler] Right.
This guy was in a weird way reconciling his mortality.
[Shannon] Yeah.
Hilariously in front of us. Ironically, heâ€™s no longer with us.
Oh, yeah.
Weâ€™re sitting in the aftermath of the life of Norm Macdonald, watching him be incredibly alive.
[Letterman] But, heâ€¦ his circumstance, he nudged into it several timesâ€¦
Right.
â€¦but didnâ€™t linger. And to us, from this perspective, powerfully meaningful.
He definitely wantedâ€“ Iâ€™m sorry, Molly.
No, you go, Adam.
I was just going to say he definitely wanted to make the point he loves his mom.
Thatâ€™s what I was going to say! There was a moment where you just have this glimpse where he takes a pause and heâ€™s like, â€œSheâ€™s great.â€
Yeah.
[Shannon] Remember?
Absolutely.
It was so touching.
Heâ€™s talking a lot about mortality. Heâ€™s talking a lot about death. Obviously, now that people, you know, comics talk about that all the time, butâ€¦ it has thisâ€¦
How would those have registered in front of a live audience, do you think?
â€œNot wanting to suck his motherâ€™s titsâ€ would kill.
That was murder! He went all the way around the barn for that one.
Thatâ€™s right! He went all the way around the barn. He had this great way of making youâ€¦ heâ€™d plant the seed, walk all over the hill, around the silo, down to the brook. Youâ€™ve forgotten about it, and then he lands that again and itâ€™s joyous. Itâ€™s just joyous, but I, you know, this form makes me so appreciate what I always knew. His face, his eyes, and his eyebrows. Thereâ€™s something almost like a jack-oâ€™-lantern. Heâ€™s got such a greatâ€¦ his expressions when heâ€™s talking about after someoneâ€™s completed the act, when he becomes, â€œWhat am I going to do now?â€ â€œIâ€™ll have a cheese sandwich.â€ Heâ€™s such a terrific performer. Heâ€™s really just got this. And heâ€™s telling the whole story like, I donâ€™t know, a great 1920s silent film comic.
When he smiled, I could picture him as a child.
Aw.
Oh, yeah.
He has aâ€¦ you know, heâ€™s my senior, but heâ€™s got a boyish charm. When he laughs at his own jokes.
Man, him laughing is amazing.
Thereâ€™s something just joyful about watching it.
Does anybody know the length of time it would take him to compile an hour of material? Would that be six months, a year?
He had more material. We were on the road one time and he would swap sets out of nowhere. Heâ€™d be like, â€œIâ€™m gonna try something.â€ He didnâ€™t really talk about it. Weâ€™d say, â€œYou doing this joke?â€ Heâ€™d be like, â€œI donâ€™t know about that.â€
[Spade] Heâ€™d flip a whole set.
Heâ€™d flipâ€“ yeah. One time, in some conversation, he goes, â€œI got a good eight hours now.â€ Or something like that. Eight hours.
You remember that Star Search bit he used to do? The scaffolding in the bit was always the same, but Iâ€™ve never seen him do it the same twice. He would just make up these crazy Star Search intros.
Oh, Star Search.
[Chappelle] Star Searchâ€¦ â€œThis next band has been kicking around the Miami area for the last 15 years. Give it up for â€˜Overnight Sensation,'â€ heâ€™d say. He would do that. He had a million of them. And Iâ€™ve seen him do the bit a bunch of times, never the same. The scaffolding was the same, the lyrics always change.
He also had an infinite collection of old stories. I think probably from rural Canada or traveling salesman stories. And I would be delighted because heâ€™d come out and Iâ€™d be laughing, only person I could say this about, Iâ€™d be laughing before he did anything. Heâ€™d come out from behind the curtain and heâ€™s got those cheeks and those eyes. And Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™ve looked at the tape, Iâ€™m just laughing. He hasnâ€™t done anything yet. Then Iâ€¦ â€œNorm, how are you?â€ Heâ€™s likeâ€¦ [mumbles] â€œBought a farm.â€ And I know immediately this is complete bullshit. You know, the whole thing is a complete waste of everyoneâ€™s time and itâ€™s joyous.
[Letterman] Right. Heâ€™s reveling in it.
Heâ€™s reveling in every second of it.
This wife Ruth he was speaking ofâ€¦
Nothingâ€™s real!
Yeah. Agnes at the desk.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
I can remember reading his autobiography and enjoying it, but being greatly disappointed about ten pages in when I realized it was all fantasy.
[all laughing]
I want to know about Normâ€™s life, but this was other solar system.
We were on the road. It was Adam and Rob Schneider, Norm and a bunch of us. Some nights he would flip the whole set. But some nights he would do like the bomb set. And he would just walk people. He would do it almost on purpose. You know? Some nights he would say, â€œThis is the set youâ€™re gettingâ€¦â€
He didâ€“ this is courtesy of Jim Downey who did â€œUpdateâ€ with Norm. The thing that stuns me is he used toâ€¦ thereâ€™s drafts for Saturday Night Live and then thereâ€™s air. And Norm would do his set for â€œUpdateâ€ in front of the dress crowd. Thereâ€™d be certain jokes that got absolutely nothing. Now, a sketch can maybe do better on air than it didâ€“ but a joke, if it bombs at dress in that format, it will bomb on air. It just will. So he had undisputed proof that his joke was going to bomb. But he liked the joke. Heâ€™d turn to Downey and say, â€œWeâ€™re doing it.â€ And Downey would say, â€œThatâ€™s a great joke.â€ â€œYeah, weâ€™re doing it.â€ Now, thatâ€¦ I like to do well. And if Iâ€™m handed absolute proof that I will fail, I will change course. I will admit it. Iâ€™m notâ€“ that guy, thereâ€™s something in him thatâ€™s unbelievably fearless.
What youâ€™re describing there, when I would watch those segments, they were delightful. There was something more exciting and interesting about the silence and Normâ€™s joy at having landed the dud.
Holding his smile.
It was thrilling. It was heroic.
He was telling us, â€œThis is a good joke and Iâ€™m sticking with it.â€ His eyes would just light up when he was getting nothing. â€œYouâ€™ve got what Iâ€™m serving tonight. This is what weâ€™re serving at the restaurant. This is what youâ€™re eating. There you go.â€ Yeah.
Thatâ€™s a perfect way to put it. Itâ€™s like a master chef. â€œWhat do you know? Fuck your taste buds.â€
The sushi restaurant where they go, â€œWe donâ€™t do California Rolls here.â€
I just like that that guy is certainâ€¦ in his sensibility. Itâ€™s fun to watch.
You get more than a joke and a laugh. You get that tone, you get that attitude. There is that invisible connection. We know what youâ€™re up to, Norm. This is what we love.
Itâ€™s like why rock and roll is cool. The swag of, like, heâ€™s just doing it. Itâ€™s â€™80s hip, bro. It was great.
He came on our show one time, your old studio, The Late Night Show. And heâ€“ I went in just to say hi before the segment. Heâ€™s in the dressing room right outside the double doors. Inconsolable because he had bet on a big game that had just ended.
Oh, yeah! He would get mad.
Iâ€™m there to try and make sure that the guest is in a good mood. Weâ€™re going to have a good ramp up. And I remembered him: â€œThatâ€™s a lot of money!â€
Yeah, yeah.
And I hear the band outside. [mimics band playing] Itâ€™s going to be good time show business with a man that just lost 55 thousandâ€“ Who knows what he lost, you know?
Recently destitute Norm Macdonald.
[Oâ€™Brien] Exactly, yeah.
Did he give that up, do we know?
I donâ€™t know.
I donâ€™tâ€“ I donâ€™t know a hundred percent.
Whenever it was him reading an excerpt from his book or his book on tape, where he describes his gambling addiction so poetically.
Oh, wow.
He talks about roulette.
Roulette.
Yeah.
Itâ€™s a book on tape.
How hopeful it is to beâ€¦
Heâ€™s addicted to the hope of it.
And thereâ€™s no way you can talk about Norm and not, because we all know that gambling was part of his life.
And he, you can justâ€“ in his comedy, heâ€™s just always putting everything on 17 red, or 35 black.
Thatâ€™s amazing.
Itâ€™s really the same, whatever, the same thrill.
Youâ€™re right, thatâ€™s interesting.
â€œIâ€™m not taking that.â€ You know?
I have a funny Norm gambling one.
And this isâ€¦ everything is true because some of it doesnâ€™t make sense.
But we lived in the same building.
I went up to visit him in his room.
We come over to his apartment, that wasâ€¦ going into his apartment was bananas as it is.
But weâ€™re having a nice time and I say, â€œYou got any soda?â€
And I open up his fridge and, I swear to God, Twenty-five thousand dollars worth of chips.
Atlantic City chips are in his fridge. I go, â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€
And he goes, â€œI won big. I won big on Friday.â€
I said, â€œWhy didnâ€™t you cash it in, buddy?â€
He goes, â€œI brought it here so I can talk to Bernie Brillstein to see how I donâ€™t have to pay taxes on it.â€
So I go, â€œOh.â€
He goes, â€œSo I bring it back Monday.
He told me no matter what, I gotta pay taxes so it didnâ€™t work out.â€
So, whatever, I go, â€œOh, that sucks.â€
Anyways, I see him on Saturday Night Live on Monday, I go, â€œDid you cash it in?â€ He goes, â€œI lost it all.â€
[all laugh]
Weâ€™d go down the elevators.
They have limos for us for the SNL to go to the after-party.
So, we get in them and Max, the guy, goes, â€œNorm sometimes takes us to Atlantic City.â€
He skips the party to go right there and that Monday he comes back, he said the same thing, â€œHe keeps chips in his refrigerator because no one looks in the fridge if theyâ€™re robbing him.â€
Oh, thatâ€™s funny!
Thatâ€™s genius.
Better than the Bernie.
Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing.
Thatâ€™s fantastic.
Wow.
You guys are lucky to get to work with him that way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thereâ€™s a few people in my careerâ€¦
Itâ€™s like why I go to the fights if I know Mayweather is fighting.
Because I know this guy is great and heâ€™s only got so many fights in him.
This guy.
[Shannon] I was going to say I really liked him right away.
I just saw himâ€¦ I felt like I understood him a different way.
I felt deep down he was actually very, very shy.
[Sandler] Oh, yeah.
[Shannon] Donâ€™t you think?
Very shy.
And sweet.
[Shannon] And so sweet.
He talked about your parents a lot.
He loved his dad more than anything.
He talked about his dad a lot.
He loved his mom, his brotherâ€¦ and his boy.
Deeply, so sensitive.
When you lost your dad, Dave, and you were talking about that, Iâ€™m sure he really wanted to make you feel so good.
So sweet and thoughtful, probably thought deeply about that thatâ€™s how he would approach it.
It was very, it seemed very thoughtful.
And wildly, disarmingly empathetic.
Itâ€™s very rare that Iâ€™d meet somebody in a professional situation that made me put my dukes down like that.
Like, defenselessâ€¦
This guy doesnâ€™t have an ounce of judgment in him unless itâ€™s hilarious.
Yeah.
And Dave, when does that movie come out?
[laughter]
I remember when you did that movie.
Yeah.
I remember that.
The irony, I really did try to get out of it.
But I couldnâ€™t imagine my life without having done it or getting to spend that time with him.
Do we know if he did any of this material in front of an audience?
We knew some from that tour. That tour was right before Corona, I thinkâ€¦
Remember the day before the lockdown, Norm had some set that went viral.
He did?
It was a cookie jar dunk.
It was, it wasâ€¦
I remember me and my buddies in Ohio were all like, â€œYo, did you see this Norm Macdonald set?â€ It was on YouTube.
Probably still on there.
He destroyed.
He evenâ€“
Right. At the Improv.
When he talked about the pandemic.
It was incredible.
It was a cookie jar dunk.
And you could tell it was off the rip.
It was all the anxiety the day before the whole world goes into lockdown.
Yeah.
And he was just on someâ€¦
â€œFuck it.â€ It felt so good.
Again, it made me feel like everythingâ€™s going to be fine.
If he were alive and were doing this show that we watched tonight somewhere in front of two, three hundred, four hundred peopleâ€¦
killer, standing O?
What would be the impact?
The question to me is heâ€™s clearly touching on some third rail stuff.
And it really depends on itsâ€¦
Yeah, he didnâ€™t have to leave on a big laugh.
He would go on, some of his shit would murder.
Some of his shit would eat it, some people would get annoyed, upset that he said it.
Then, like most of us, you go, â€œLet me get out of this fucking hole and come up with a big joke because Iâ€™m about to get off.â€
Heâ€™d go, â€œAll right. Letâ€™s keep going down.
Weâ€™ll get out on that.â€
Iâ€™m certain that twenty-five minutes of this would kill.
-Yeah.
Right.
This would probably be about, with laughs,
it would haveâ€¦ 35, 38 minutes. Easy.
Youâ€™d have notesâ€¦ youâ€™d have people sayingâ€“
[Spade] Yeah, if you tried it, practiced it.
Plus that cannibal stuff.
When he says, â€œIt gets on red, I go, â€˜Fuck, so close!'â€
Thereâ€™s some stuff thatâ€™s for sure laugh lines.
It would work anywhere.
Then he pulls you away from it for a while.
And theyâ€™re trickier stuff.
Itâ€™s trickier to figure it out.
And he would lose some people.
Itâ€™s hard to separateâ€¦ Iâ€™d buy it.
You know what I mean? Iâ€™m in.
-Yeah.
[Letterman] Thatâ€™s right.
Yeah.
Itâ€™s like watching a four-hour Mooney set.
At a certain point itâ€™s like, Iâ€™m just invested in this
as an experience.
And itâ€™s really hard to separate myself from it.
Itâ€™s fun to watch him acknowledge what would be the silence.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
-I can see.
And enjoy it.
-Yeah.
Enjoy it.
I can see theâ€¦ In his mind there was a crowd there.
He was anticipating his crowd.
Which reminds me again, this guy was very deliberate in how he approached this.
â€˜Cause it does seem like jazz.
It was very methodical.
Itâ€™s funny because heâ€™sâ€¦ you know.
All Iâ€™ve ever heard about Norm is that he was the most widely read comedian.
Very widely read.
Highly intelligent.
I think a great, you know, mathematician. Things that you would never think.
He was talented in all these areas
and choosing, â€œWhatâ€™s my diction, whatâ€™s my word going to be?â€
â€œWhatâ€™s the right word here?
Whatâ€™s it exactly going to be?â€
So you get thisâ€¦
Because he seems reckless,
but heâ€™s also ruthlessly planned everything out
and thought it through.
They donâ€™t seem to go together.
But with him, they do.
Yeah.
But was hisâ€¦ Iâ€™m sorry, Molly.
I was going to say beforeâ€¦ in the last, whatever, 13, 14 years,
he got, as you say, Conan, he was reading four or five books at a time.
Russian literature,
Mark Twain was his favorite author.
He loved Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
But he got really into reading about God and Christianity.
Oh, yeah.
Really wanting to understand God.
Where heâ€™s headed?
And feeling maybe close to death.
Yeah, sure.
Or thinking about death,
but really, really wanting to understand God.
I donâ€™t know how everyone else felt here,
but Norm got sick for quite a while
and he got sicker
and I didnâ€™t know.
I talked to so many people who I was sure knew.
I thought, maybe Iâ€™m the only one that doesnâ€™t know.
So manyâ€¦ He didnâ€™t want anybody to know.
I didnâ€™t know.
Andâ€¦
so, you know, being the self-absorbed person I am,
I think a lot of us, we thought, â€œIs he mad at me?â€
â€œIs there something I did?â€
Because we kept trying to get him to come back on
and we couldnâ€™t. He couldnâ€™t do it.
â€˜Cause I donâ€™t think he was up for it.
And he didnâ€™t want to answer questions about maybe his appearance, but I rememberedâ€¦
Yeah.
â€¦when he went, everybody in the community wasâ€¦
we all thought we were the only one that didnâ€™t know.
We were so upset that we didnâ€™t get a chance to tell him what he meant to us.
I very quickly realized he would not have tolerated that.
He didnâ€™t want any of us to tell himâ€¦
-Heâ€™d get grossed out.
Heâ€™d get very unhappy.
Treat him different or laugh at his jokes.
You reflect on experiences you had with him
during the time he was ill
and wondered if that had manifest itself because of the illness.
[Spade] Right.
Iâ€™m curious as to what his process was, if you knew how he wrote.
My experience was so chaotic.
You know, I thought this guy is Evel Knievel.
Heâ€™s going to jump Snake River Canyon, he doesnâ€™t care.
But he put a ton of work into what he was doing.
And worked it out a lot of the time.
So, I donâ€™t know what that process was,
but this really impressed me with how self-contained it is.
[Letterman] Yeah.
And howâ€¦
He scribbled a lot of stuff down all the time.
He was just like most comedians.
He was constantly writing his jokes down.
[Letterman] Itâ€™s a lot of work.
Yeah.
No laughs. A lot of work.
[Sandler] Yeah.
You said something that reminded me ofâ€¦
I donâ€™t know what story he was telling.
But the story was, in the beginning of the story
heâ€™s telling, he used to go to this Christian Revival Church.
He goes, â€œI donâ€™t really believe any of this stuff.â€
I go, â€œThen whyâ€™d you go?â€
I love what he said, I donâ€™t remember what he was talking about.
He goes, â€œBecause it made me feel good.â€
And the last time I saw him was at The Comedy Store.
And he was uncharacteristically emotional.
Yeah.
And like heâ€¦
when we parted company, he was.
Thereâ€™s a picture of me and him.
And the back of Chris Rockâ€™s head.
I put it in my special.
That picture, itâ€™s at the end of The Closer,
was the last time that I saw him.
[Shannon] Wow.
And he stood there.
He came up, he stood behind me, I looked, hey, looked up.
And I realized he was posing for the picture, in hindsight.
[Sandler] Uh-huh.
Like a gift.
Thatâ€™s nice.
It was a very fitting goodbye.
That is so sweet, Dave.
Yeah.
Hey, man, what about when he was emotional saying goodbye to you on the show?
At the time, like Conan suggests,
I didnâ€™t know he was ill. So, surprised.
In thinking about that moment,
he must have known a great deal about what his future was
and how long it might have been.
I always took it as an enormous compliment
that my emotional situation had affected him.
[Sandler] Right.
But now, to be fair,
this guy knew more than just I was leaving.
Well, he was crazy about you. I meanâ€¦
Absolutely.
Thatâ€™s very sweet.
I saw him on your show once and he said,
â€œIâ€™ve seen more sunsets than I will ever see.â€
He said that to you on the show.
In case you hear different.
Iâ€™m sorry to interrupt, though.
[Oâ€™Brien] No, thatâ€™s okay.
I probably cut him off and said, â€œWe got to get to Al Roker now.â€
He probably was about to say something very profound.
Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s great, Norm.
Al Rokerâ€™s here. He came up three floors to be with us tonight.
And heâ€™s got nothing. Al Roker.â€
I saw him at the SNL 40th.
I didnâ€™t know he had cancer or anything, but I remember as soon as he told me, he was like,
â€œI love you, Molly.â€ He blurted it out right away.
I think I was likeâ€¦ I just had a sense of like,
I could feel that he had this kind of urgency
to say exactly what was on his mind in the moment.
Because maybe heâ€™ll never have that moment again.
I was like, â€œSomethingâ€™s different with Norm.â€
The last time I saw him with any regularity was
we all went on a tour to do stand-up.
The three of you guys?
[Sandler] And a couple of other guys.
We had a text chain of a bunch of us.
We had a text chain.
Weâ€™d all fuck around.
And then one time he was arguing with Schneider about something
about stand-up and he goes,
â€œIâ€™m the best comic out of all of us.â€
And everyone wentâ€¦ â€œYeah.â€
Yeah. Thatâ€™s true.
No one fought back.
They go, â€œOkay.â€
Youâ€™re right.
I think thatâ€™s fair, honestly.
And we go, â€œSure.â€
But he wasâ€¦
the nice thing is we were flying around or on the bus or backstage,
he would come in and do bits.
He wanted to keepâ€“ I like that, you know?
People are still funny, and heâ€™s a good laugher.
And thatâ€™s always nice when a comic is a good laugher too,
instead of just only going one way with it.
They like to crack up with people, and it wasâ€¦ that was a fucking blast.
Didnâ€™t he wear a cowboy hat the whole time?
He bought a cowboy hat. Norm all of a sudden with a cowboy hat.
Walking around.
It was so weird.
On stage he would sit sometimes.
He sometimes would sit.
Sometimes heâ€™d be late in the morning,
because weâ€™re all taking off and Iâ€™d go,
â€œI would just go ahead. Norm, man, we got to get to this place.â€
And heâ€™d give me a look.
Then after he passed away I realized
he was giving me a look like,
â€œWhat the fuck do you want from me? Iâ€™m going through some shit.â€
Heâ€™d be like, â€œYeah, all right.â€
But never any deeper knowledge of it?
Never anything.
Yeah. Wow.
He did get emotional a lot, though.
On the whole tour, he would just all of a sudden
get really teary-eyed and stuff
and heâ€™d be like, â€œThis is wonderful.â€
The tour itself. And hanging out.
Weâ€™d have dinners and breakfast.
[Spade] Yeah.
And shit.
And he was moreâ€¦ Heâ€™d just be so fun to see.
He had so much energy to hang.
The hard part about not telling people, which, it would worry me a little bit, isâ€¦
I got slightly angry because during the thing, he would set up dinners with me and he would keep canceling.
I didnâ€™t know if it was a bit orâ€¦ but it got frustrating because I go, â€œIf youâ€™re scared of Corona, just come over to the house. It will just be me and you, weâ€™ll sit across or whatever.â€
â€œYeah, thatâ€™s what I want.
Iâ€™d like just a good night with Davey.â€
And then he goesâ€¦
That night I go, â€œWhere are you?â€ He goes,
â€œI canâ€™t, itâ€™s COVID.â€
I go, â€œI know, we just talked about this.â€
And then a week later: â€œDo you want to have dinner?â€
And I goâ€¦ fighting to fuck him up.
But I donâ€™t even know if it wasâ€“
I think he would maybe think about it
and then heâ€™d go, â€œI donâ€™t feel good,â€ or something.
But later I was getting irritated because Iâ€™m like,
â€œYou can come over.â€ I didnâ€™t know what was going on,
but if I did, of course, Iâ€™d go, â€œWhatever you want.â€
Iâ€™m a little like that because I would love to have dinner
with each of you but it will never happen.
[all laugh]
Weâ€™ve all tried, Dave.
Weâ€™ve all tried. [laughs]
â™ªâ™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m just an old chunk of coal â™ª
â™ª But Iâ€™m gonna be a diamond some day â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m gonna grow and glow Till Iâ€™m so blue â™ª
â™ª Perfect â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m gonna put a smile on Everybodyâ€™s face â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m gonna kneel and pray every day â™ª
â™ª Lest I should become vain Along the way â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m just an old chunk of coal now, Lord â™ª
â™ª But Iâ€™m gonna be a diamond some day â™ª

[audience cheering and applauding]
[announcer] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Please welcome to the stage a man who really doesnâ€™t need to do this.
[audience laughing]
Ricky Gervais.
[upbeat music playing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
[audience cheering]
[music fades]
Hello. Hello. Thank you.
[cheering continues]
Shush. Thank you very much. Shush. No, shush. Thank you, but shut the fuck up. No fucking whooping orâ€¦ Just laugh. No, but thankâ€¦ Shush. Everyone calm down. Shush! Iâ€™m filming this. Shut up, you cunts!
[audience laughing]
Thank you very much. Umâ€¦ Welcome to my show. Uhâ€¦ Itâ€™s not a show. Thereâ€™s no dancers or jugglers. Itâ€™s basically a bloke talking, um, which is essentially what stand-up comedy is. A bloke talking. Sexist. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
What about all the funny female comedians? Like, umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
No. No. No. Right. No, no, no, no, no. Iâ€™m not doing that. Okay, right. That was irony, okay? Thereâ€™ll be a bit of that throughout the show. See if you can spot it. Now, thatâ€™s when I say something I donâ€™t really mean for comic effect, and you, as an audience, you laugh at the wrong thing â€™cause you know what the right thing is. Itâ€™s a way of satirizing attitudes. Like that first joke, I used the old-fashioned sexist trope that women arenâ€™t funny. Now, in real life, I know there are loads of funny women. Like, umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I did it again. Well spotted. Good.
[audience laughing]
No, but there are. Umâ€¦ Dame Edna Everage. Sheâ€™sâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Uhâ€¦ Eddie Izzard.
[audience laughing]
Sheâ€™s brilliant, inâ€™t she?
[audience laughing]
Sheâ€™s not only a great comedienne, sheâ€™s also a great actress, isnâ€™t she? She was brilliant in that thing as that man, werenâ€™t shâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s good to be back. Umâ€¦ I fell back in love with stand-up on my last tour, Humanity. I played arenas around the world. Netflix bought it for a record amount. It was the most-watched special of the year. I thought, â€œEveryone loves me now. Everyone loves me now.â€ Then I got this tweet.
[audience laughing]
A real tweet, right? â€œCall yourself a comedian?â€ He knows I do.
[audience laughing]
Literally says the word in my Twitter bio.
[audience laughing]
â€œCall yourself a comedian?â€ â€œYouâ€™re about as funny asâ€¦â€ Now, I thought he was gonna go for the jugularÂ and say, â€œMiranda,â€ orâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Come on! Come on, guys. Donâ€™tâ€¦ [Ricky laughing] Iâ€™m joking. Right.
[audience laughing]
â€œCall yourself a comedian?â€ â€œYouâ€™re about as funny as a fart at a babyâ€™s funeral.â€
[audience laughing]
Yeah. He was trying to hurt my feelings. But his big mistake was choosing summat thatâ€™d be fucking hilarious!
[audience laughing]
As if that wouldâ€¦ A fart at a babyâ€™s funeral?
[audience laughing]
Big, echoey church. Everyone just silently sobbing like that. Tiny little coffin.Â Tiny little coffin.
[audience laughing]
And someone farts?
[audience laughing]
Youâ€™d laugh.
[audience laughing]
Even if it was your baby. You know? No.
[audience laughing]
If youâ€™re at the funeral, itâ€™s been dead a week. [surprised laughter] Youâ€™re probably up for a giggle.
[audience laughing]
Particularly if youâ€™re the father. If youâ€™re the mother, you probably still find it hard seeing â€œthe funny side of things.â€
[audience laughing]
Oh, women! [groans]
[audience laughing]
Not all women. I mean, the old-fashioned ones. The old-fashioned women. Oh God! You know, the ones with wombs. Oh.
[audience laughing]
Those fucking dinosaurs. [groans]
[audience laughing]
No, I love the new women. Theyâ€™re great, arenâ€™t they? The new ones weâ€™ve been seeing lately. The ones with beards and cocks. Theyâ€™re as good asâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Theyâ€™re as good as gold. I love them.
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s the old-fashionedâ€¦ And now the old-fashioned, they go, â€œOoh, they wanna use our toilets!â€ â€œWhy shouldnâ€™t they?â€ â€œFor ladies!â€ â€œThey are ladies. Look at their pronouns.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWhat about this person isnâ€™t a lady?â€ â€œWell, his penis.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œHer penis, you fucking bigot!â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWhat if he rapes me?â€ â€œWhat if she rapes you?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYou fucking TERF whore!â€

But that tweet sums comedy up, doesnâ€™t it? How subjective it is. How one person, some people can find them hilarious, some find them the least funny person in the world. When someone says to me about another comedian, they say, â€œOh, theyâ€™re not funny,â€ even if I agree with them, I stand upâ€¦ I say, â€œYou canâ€™t say that. You gotta say you donâ€™t find them funny.â€ I hate it when people say, â€œThat joke was offensive.â€ I say, â€œNo, you gotta say you found it offensive.â€ Itâ€™s about feelings, and feelings are personal. And thereâ€™s loads of types of comedy, and comedy evolves. Thereâ€™s a new type of comedy at the moment called woke comedy, right? No, itâ€™s very progressive, you know? There are clubs where the comedian has to sign a thing saying he wonâ€™t say anything contentious or anything that could offend anyone. Itâ€™s a safe space for the audience. Woke comedy. And, uh, I tried to watch a bit of it, and I decided Iâ€™d rather watchÂ Louis CK masturbate.
[audience laughing]
Canâ€™t mention him anymore. Heâ€™s canceled. Uhâ€¦ Not enough to apologize and move on. You gottaâ€¦ Like poor Kevin Hart. See, Kevin Hart, he got the job hosting the Oscars. His best day ever. He was on Twitter, â€œIâ€™ve wanted to do this all my life.â€ And then someone found these ten-year-old tweets. Look, they were sort of childish, sort of shitty homophobic tweets. It was about his son. He was mucking around. He said, â€œOh, my sonâ€™s doing so-and-so. I hope heâ€™s not gay.â€ There was a massive backlash. He went, â€œIâ€™m not homophobic, sorry.â€ He deleted â€™em, right, and said, â€œIâ€™m really sorry.â€ Ten years later, someone finds a screen grab and goes, â€œLook, heâ€™s done this.â€ And the Oscars go, â€œYou gotta apologize again.â€ He went, â€œNo, Iâ€™ve apologized. I canâ€™t keep apologizing.â€ And heâ€™s right. If thereâ€™s no value to saying sorry and evolving, he might as well just tweet â€™em again.
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s how I deal with shit anyway.
[audience laughing]
But if youâ€™re the type of person to revel in someone getting canceled for summat they said ten years ago, youâ€™re just ensuring that one day youâ€™ll be canceled for summat you said today. You canâ€™t predict whatâ€™ll be offensive in the future. You donâ€™t know who the dominant mob will be. Like, the worst thing you can say today, get you canceled on Twitter, death threats, the worst thing you can say today is, â€œWomen donâ€™t have penises,â€ right?
[audience laughing]
Now, no one saw that coming.
[audience laughing]
There are no ten-year-old tweets of people sayingâ€¦ You wonâ€™t find a ten-year-old tweet of someone saying, â€œWomen donâ€™t have penises.â€ Do you know why? We didnâ€™t think we fucking had to.
[audience laughing]
Liam Neeson. Oh. He nearly got canceled, didnâ€™t he? Liam Neeson. Now, I donâ€™t know why he told this story.
[audience laughing]
But he did, at a press junket to a journalist, right, and he just started saying, uh, â€œIt was 30 years ago, and, uh, my friend came home, and, um, sheâ€™d been raped,â€ right, andâ€¦ Thatâ€™s not the funny bit.
[audience laughing]
[laughs] He said, â€œSheâ€™d been raped.â€ I said, â€˜What did the guy look like?'â€ â€œSaid it was a Black guy.â€ â€œSo I got my cosh and I went out looking for the first Black guy.â€ â€œNothing happened. I came to my senses.â€ But the weird thing about that story is, who has a cosh? Who has aâ€¦
[audience laughing]
But it was touch and go. They canceled the premiere â€™cause of the backlash. People wanted the film to be deleted, and I get it. Some people canâ€™t separate the art form with the artistâ€™s personal life. I know Liam. Iâ€™ve worked with him. Heâ€™s a lovely man. Definitely not racist. But when that broke, even I was like, â€œOh, will I ever be able to find Schindlerâ€™s List funny again?â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I do still find it funny, obviously.
[audience laughing]
But now thereâ€™s so much outrage, and we hear about it, and itâ€™s taken seriously, you know? Thereâ€™s Oxbridge comedians writing for the posh papers, the rules of comedy, theyâ€™re laying it down, laying down the law. And itâ€™s all stuff like, â€œComedy should punch up. You should never punch down.â€ Sometimes youâ€™ve gotta punch down, like if youâ€™re beating up a disabled toddler. Know what I mean?
[audience laughing]
If you punch up, youâ€™ll miss the little cunt. Heâ€™ll win.
[audience laughing]
I like that joke â€™cause it highlights the difference between metaphorical punching down in jokes and actual punching down. But people nowadays want you to believe that words are actual violence, right? Now, you laughed at a joke about beating up a disabled toddler. No one got hurt. If Iâ€™d have actually dragged out a disabled toddler and started beating him up, you wouldnâ€™t laugh, right? Thatâ€™s why I dropped that bit. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
But these people are virtue signaling. Theyâ€™re trying to bring people down to raise their own status, and they say, â€œNo, weâ€™re protecting minorities.â€ Theyâ€™re basically saying minorities havenâ€™t gotÂ a sense of humor, which is so patronizing. And I get that as well, what itâ€™s like to be outnumbered. In this country, weâ€™re still only 5% Black, 5% Asian, 5% LGBTQ, you know? Tiny numbers. Now, Iâ€™m a white, heterosexual multimillionaire, right?
[audience laughing]
[audience cheering]
Umâ€¦ Thereâ€™s less than 1% of us.
[audience laughing]
Butâ€¦ do I whine? No! Do Iâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I donâ€™t mind. I just get on with it. â€œCome on, Rick. Come on, Rick!â€ â€œJust keep fiâ€¦â€ Iâ€™m like Rosa Parks, know what I mean? Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Except I fought for the right to never have to take a seat on a bus, butâ€¦
[audience laughing]
People complain about things they donâ€™t have to watch. It doesnâ€™t affect them, you know? And, again, everyoneâ€™s got the right to be offended and complain, but theyâ€™ve gotta know that weâ€™re not trying to offend. Thatâ€™s not our aim, you know? Weâ€™re tying to make you laugh. Weâ€™re trying to give you a good time. Hereâ€™s the deal, right? So I riffâ€¦ If I say summat tonight thatâ€™s so offensive, that youâ€™ve never heard anything so fucking off the charts in your life, donâ€™t make a scene. Go to the box office after the show. They canâ€™t give you your money back straight away. Thereâ€™s a form you fill out with the complaint, and I take those away, and I shit on them.
[audience laughing]
So thatâ€™s the rules of comedy.
[audience cheering and applauding]
SuperNature. Why SuperNature? Well, for two reasons. One, I wanna debunk the supernatural. I donâ€™t believe in anything supernatural. I believe that anything that exists is by definition part of nature and is explainable, if not now, then eventually. Also, SuperNature â€™cause nature is super enough, you know? Itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s amazing that weâ€™re even here discussing it. Weâ€™re the only speciesÂ that allows the universe to understand itself. The chances of us being here at all, the chances of you being you existing now, the chances of that sperm hitting that egg is 400 trillion to one. And I think life is like a holiday. We donâ€™t exist for 13 and a half billion years, then we have these 80, 90 years if weâ€™re lucky, then we die, never to exist again. Some people are even offended by that. They go, â€œYou canâ€™t say that. This canâ€™t be chance.â€ â€œItâ€™s too good. Someone must have made it all.â€ â€œIâ€™m too special. I canâ€™t just not exist.â€ â€œIâ€™ll live again. Iâ€™ll, uhâ€¦ Iâ€™ll go to heaven.â€ â€œIâ€™ll be with my friends and family or come back as a spirit and walk amongst you.â€ â€œOr Iâ€™ll be reincarnated. Iâ€™ll come back as someone else.â€ Thatâ€™d just be someone else.
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s happened. Youâ€™re not involved. That is justâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€¦someone else, right?
Many people believe in reincarnation, of course. Some people claim they remember who they were in a previous life. Umâ€¦ Thereâ€™s a society in America, of courseâ€¦ Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
In California, of course, right?
[audience laughing]
And they remember who they were in a previous life. Theyâ€™re always someone pretty special in their previous life. Not so much in the life theyâ€™ve got now, right?
[audience laughing]
But I saw a documentary about it, and every year, they have a â€œcome as you wereâ€ party, where they go dressed as the person they were in history. Two Napoleons.
[audience laughing]
So at least one of â€™em is fucking lying.
[audience laughing]
No reincarnation. No ghosts. You seen all the ghost hunter shows? Oh my God, hundreds of ghost hunter shows. Years and years. Celebrity Ghost Hunter. All around the world, thousands and thousands of hours of footage, theyâ€™ve never seen a fucking ghost. Not one. Itâ€™s all like, â€œWhat was that? Oh, itâ€™s just theâ€¦ No, not theâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œDid you hear that? Oh, was it you?â€ â€œNo.â€
[audience laughing]
Imagine if wildlife programs were like that.
[audience laughing]
Imagine watching David Attenborough all these years and he goes, â€œHere on Kilimanjaro, we seeâ€¦â€ â€œOh, no, itâ€™s notâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œAnd by the banks of the Limpopo, the elusiveâ€¦â€ â€œOh, itâ€™s notâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
Youâ€™d stop watching the cunt.
[audience laughing]
Theyâ€™ve never seen a ghost.
The pedo hunter shows, on the other handâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Thereâ€™s usually a couple in the crew just in case.
[audience laughing]
Particularly if itâ€™s a BBC production. Oh shut up!
[audience cheering and applauding]
Thereâ€™s no reincarnation, no ghosts, no heaven, I believe. People canâ€™t get over that. People quiz me on Twitter when they find out Iâ€™m an atheist. They go, â€œYou donâ€™t believe in God at all?â€ I go, â€œNo.â€ â€œDo you pray?â€ I go, â€œNo.â€ They go, â€œWhy donâ€™t you pray just in case thereâ€™s a God?â€ I say, â€œWhy donâ€™t you put garlic over your door just in case thereâ€™s a Dracula?â€
[audience laughing]
I got no problem with praying. I know loads of nice Christians and Muslims and Jews, and if one of my family is very ill, they say, â€œIâ€™ll pray for them.â€ I say, â€œThanks very much,â€ â€™cause itâ€™s a nice gesture. If they said, â€œWe also canceled the chemotherapy,â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œDonâ€™t do that. Donâ€™t do that.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œPray? Fill your boots, son, but letâ€™sâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œLetâ€™s do the praying and the chemotherapy, shall we?â€ â€œâ€˜Cause thatâ€™s the same result as just the chemotherapy, so letâ€™sâ€¦ letâ€™s definitely keep that one, shall we?â€
[audience laughing]
I got in trouble talking about praying on Twitter. Remember a few years ago, that terrible disaster in Oklahoma, the hurricane? People lost their lives, their livelihood, and I donated to the Red Cross. I tweeted about it with a link saying, â€œYou can donate here too,â€ trying to help them, and one of thoseÂ frivolous entertainment magazines from America, their account tweeted this thing that annoyed me. They tweeted,Â â€œBeyoncÃ© and Rihanna send prayers to Oklahoma.â€ And I tweeted back going, â€œI feel like a cunt. I only sent money.â€
[audience laughing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
Someone tweeted me once, â€œWould you come to the bedside of a dying child and tell them thereâ€™s no heaven?â€ I tweeted back, â€œIs it a paid gig?â€
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing] Ohâ€¦
[audience laughing]
I donâ€™t care whether you believe or not, what you believe in, who you pray to. Doesnâ€™t affect me. I just think that nature is super enough, you know? I donâ€™t think we need angels and unicorns. Weâ€™ve got the fucking octopus. That actually exists. Eight legs, nine brains, three hearts, and a beak. Make your fucking mind up! What are you doing? The duck-billed platypus, a monotreme. When scientists first found that, they thought it was a hoax â€™cause it produces eggs and milk. It could make its own custard. It doesnâ€™t, but itâ€¦ it could.
[audience laughing]
It could. It definitely could. [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
But even though we know the chances of us existing at all are astronomical and that life is so short, we waste so much of it worrying about stuff, about things that might never happen, about things that wonâ€™t matter in a week, let alone a year or ten years. Iâ€™m terrible. I worry. Iâ€™m a worrier. I lay awake at night thinking, â€œWhat ifâ€¦â€ and all that, and I hate being stressed. So I try and rule stress out of my life, which is really stressful â€™cause I have to have a plan A and a plan B and a plan C. And if I do all my work, at home, I go, â€œRight, militant. No work. Just relax.â€ â€œJust a glass of wine. Just relax.â€ If summat comes through the door, Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat the fuckâ€™s that?â€
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s usually money. [sighs] Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Right. [laughs] And Jane, my girlfriend, sheâ€™s like, â€œLetâ€™s have a look, shall we?â€ She tries to calm me down. Iâ€™ve been with Jane now nearly 40 years. And weâ€™veâ€¦
[audience cheering]
Thank you. And weâ€™ve always had cats â€™cause Jane read early days thatÂ a cat will make you live longer,Â de-stress you, stops you having a heart attack and stroke if youâ€™re wound up. She was basically trying to save my life. So we got cats. Weâ€™ve always had cats. I think it works. Like, if Iâ€™m really stressed, I go, â€œWhereâ€™s the cat?â€ Right? Fell asleep. â€œWake up!â€ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
â€œWhat?â€ So, no, then I stroke the cat, and Iâ€™m thinking, â€œOh, Iâ€™m stressed.â€ â€œLook, sheâ€™s so unstressed.â€ And I think, â€œThatâ€™s unfair,â€ and that stresses me out a little bit. Iâ€™ve gotÂ the weight of the world on my shoulders. Sheâ€™s got nothing. No conscience, no guilt. You will never see a cat feeling guilty. You will never go into a room and see a cat like that, â€œThatâ€™s fucked up.â€
[audience laughing]
You go, â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œAll the fucking shit in there. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s the matter, mate.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œLike what?â€ â€œLikeâ€¦ like that bloody mouse I killed.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œProbably had a family, didnâ€™t it?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œProbably, yeah.â€ â€œI didnâ€™t have to torture it first.â€
[audience laughing]
They donâ€™t give a fuck.
[audience laughing]
If a cat was big enough, it would kill you and eat you. Theyâ€™re the opposite to dogs. This sums up the difference between cats and dogs once and for all. The cat has got a barbed penis. True. Google it. Careful. Right, butâ€¦
[audience laughing]
A barbed penis, right? Two reasons. One, it holds the female in place during mating. So it slides in easy, then it goes, â€œOh, run? Oh, you canâ€™t.â€
[audience laughing]
And, two, when it withdraws, that pain causes the female to ovulate. Think of a different way, mate. And that makes me think maybe there is a God â€™cause, I mean,Â maybe he did cats and dogs â€™cause theyâ€™reâ€¦ He went, â€œBoom, there you go.â€ â€œCats and dogs, youâ€™re ballpark furry mammals.â€ â€œYou live at home. Itâ€™s a good gig. You get fed. â€œWhat sort of penis were youâ€¦ hoping for? â€œDog.â€ â€œDoesnâ€™t matter.â€ â€œWhatever youâ€¦ Itâ€™ll be the best penis ever.â€ â€œJust summat that matches my onesie, just a little, uhâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œMaybe a little furry mound. Summat lady dogs would like.â€ â€œA little furry mound with a little pink lipstick in it.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œFurry lipstick. Good choice.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œCat.â€
â€œGimme a fuck-stalk with hooks.â€
[audience laughing]
The cat is the only animal that domesticated itself. Itâ€™s true. Just wandered into civilization about 10,000 years ago and went, â€œMeow! Feed me,â€ right? They made the meow up for us. They donâ€™t do that in the feral state. â€œMeow!â€ They learned that weâ€¦ â€œAw!â€ And it works. My cat goes, â€œMeow!â€ â€œAw!â€ I let my cat do anything it wants. It can sleep or go where it wants. If we get a parcel in the post, if I undo it, right, and if she gets in the box, â€œAw!â€ I canâ€™t throw it away. We got about 17 all over theâ€¦ mansion. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
And if weâ€™re watching telly, me and Jane, if it gets in our lap, such aÂ privilege, we donâ€™t move. Even if we need a wee, we donâ€™t wanna disturb it. The other one gets the drinks all night. â€œAw!â€ And people say to me, â€œYou spoil that cat.â€ I go, â€œYeah, I do. Itâ€™s a cat.â€ Itâ€™s not a person. Whatâ€™s the worst that can happen if you spoil a cat? It doesnâ€™t grow up to be fucking Boris Johnson. Itâ€™sâ€¦
[audience laughing]
No, I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t get political. Umâ€¦ Although he is out of his depth, okay?
[audience laughing]
I mean, he started off by saying women in burkas look like postboxes. Now, itâ€™s not up to Boris Johnson what a Muslim woman wears on her face. Itâ€™s up to her husband.
[audience laughing]
Notâ€¦ Not my rules.Â Not my rules.
[audience laughing]
This wonâ€™t be in the special. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing]
[audience applauding]
Edit.
[audience laughing]
Yeah, cats, inâ€™t they?
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
No, Iâ€¦ I do love cats. Umâ€¦ I really love dogs. We havenâ€™t got a dog â€™cause we travel too much, usually. But wherever we are in the world, New York or London, we go for a walk every day just to meet dogs, in Central Park or Hampstead Heath. I know about 200 dogs by name now, and you always meet a few of your little friends, and it sets me up for the day. Itâ€™s like my fucking heroin. And if you meet a brand-new dog, you go, â€œHello,â€ heâ€™s never met you before, and if youâ€™re nice to it, heâ€™s just met you, and suddenly youâ€™re bestâ€¦ Heâ€™d do anything for you. â€œNeed a kidney?â€ They are amazing, dogs. It makes me laugh, that sign people put on their house, â€œBeware of the dog.â€ That makes me wanna go in the house to meet it. So if you wanna keep me out of your house, put up a sign that says, I dunno, â€œBeware of the AIDS,â€ you know?
[audience laughing]
Although thatâ€™s not as good as it was, is it, AIDS? No, seriously, itâ€™s like all diseases let you down, but that wasâ€¦ I mean, in its heyday, it was fucking amazing, wasnâ€™t it, AIDS?
[audience laughing]
Coronavirus? Fuck off. That couldnâ€™tâ€¦ couldnâ€™t hold a candle to AIDS.
[audience laughing]
In the â€™80s, two blokes talking, it would be, â€œOh, will you suck my cock?â€ â€œFuck off. Youâ€™ve got AIDS. Iâ€™d die.â€ Now itâ€™s, â€œGive it here. Iâ€™ll take pills for the rest of my life.â€ Thereâ€™s noâ€¦
[audience laughing]
But the bigots jumped on it in the â€™80s, the Christian right, all fundamentalists, actually, by going, â€œThis is Godâ€™s wrath.â€ â€œThis is Godâ€™s punishment for homosexuality.â€ Imagine thinking that. What are you imagining in your head to think thatâ€™s true? So you think Godâ€™s in heaven, do you, and heâ€™s looking down on civilization, and he suddenly goes, â€œIâ€™m sick of all this bummingâ€?
[audience laughing]
â€œI mean, what theâ€¦â€ â€œOh, come on, lads! Whatâ€™s goingâ€¦ What?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œOh, look atâ€¦â€ â€œIâ€™ve warned â€™em. Itâ€™s in the Bible.â€ â€œNo bumming.â€ Not in those words.
[audience laughing]
Leviticus 28:11. â€œAny man who lieth with another man as he doth a woman, they are both an abomination and shall surely be put to death.â€ Basically, no bumming, right?
[audience laughing]
So he went, â€œTheyâ€™re taking the piss. Iâ€™ve gotta do summat.â€ â€œI know. AIDS.â€ Like that. Like he did with light, just like, â€œOh, itâ€™s dark. What can I do?â€ â€œLight,â€ right? â€œLet there be light.â€ The same with this. â€œLet there be AIDS.â€ â€œAnd there was AIDS.â€ Not on earth, but up in his laboratory, right? So heâ€™d made the AIDS, all there, horrible little things, right, â€œThere you are.â€ [growls] You couldnâ€™t see â€™em, but he could see â€™em. [growls] Like that, right? And he went, â€œRight, youâ€™re AIDS.â€ They went, â€œWeâ€™re what?â€ He went, â€œYouâ€™re AIDS.â€ They went, â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ â€œItâ€™s, like, the worst disease ever.â€ They went, â€œOh, brilliant.â€ And he wentâ€¦ Netflix have already bought this. Fuck â€™em, right?
[audience laughing]
â€œYouâ€™re AIDS.â€ â€œRight, what do we do?â€ â€œRight, I want you to kill homosexuals.â€ â€œWhy?â€ â€œI donâ€™t like watching â€™em.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œDonâ€™t watch â€™em, then.â€ â€œIâ€™ve got no choice. Iâ€™m omnipresent, soâ€¦â€ â€œIâ€™m watching 50 million people bumming right now.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œSo, you knowâ€¦â€ â€œRight. So what do we do?â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna put you down on earth.â€ â€œWhere?â€ [sighs] â€œAfrica, right?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWhy Africa?â€
â€œTheyâ€™re dying anyway.â€
[audience] Oh!
Thatâ€™s not me saying that, is it? Thatâ€™s God. Thatâ€™s God saying that.
[audience laughing]
[sighs]
[audience laughing]
â€œWhereâ€¦ where in Africa?â€ â€œOh, just in an arse, right? Iâ€™m gonna put you inâ€¦â€ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
â€œIâ€™m gonnaâ€¦ â€œâ€In all the shit?â€ â€œYes, yes. Iâ€™m gonna put you in an arse.â€ â€œThat is where youâ€™re gonna do a lot of your best work through the 1980s.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œRight? So Iâ€™m gonna cram you in an arse, right?â€ â€œThen what?â€ â€œRight.â€ â€œIf a cock comes in, that shouldnâ€™t be there, right?â€ â€œGet in the cock as well.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWhat, all of us?â€ â€œNo.â€ â€œSome of you get in the cock, some of you stay in the arse in case another cock comes along.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œAnd if I know this arse, there will be another cock.â€ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
â€œSo some of us get in the cock, some of us stay in the arse.â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œThen what?â€ â€œKill â€™em both, right?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œSo kill all homosexuals?â€ â€œExactly.â€ â€œWhat, even lesbians?â€ â€œNo, not lesbians, right?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWhy?â€
â€œâ€˜Cause I like watching them.â€
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing]
[audience applauding]
[Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
But all diseases let you down eventually, not just AIDS. Umâ€¦ After AIDS, it was SARS, wasnâ€™t it? Remember SARS? â€œOoh, gonna wipe out humanity.â€ Didnâ€™t. Then, uh,Â Ebola, the flesh-eating disease. â€œOoh, Ebolaâ€™s come to London!â€ Some nurse got hot for the weekend and that was it, right? Then Zika virus. Remember those babies born with half a head? â€œZika virus!â€ â€œDonâ€™t worry about it.â€ â€œOh, Iâ€™m pregnant!â€ â€œStart knitting a hat.â€
[audience laughing]
You know? Talking of abortion, umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Now, I donâ€™t wanna divide the room, um, but Iâ€™m pro-choice. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s anything to do with me or any man what a woman does with her body. But on theâ€¦
[cheering]
Thank you. On the flip side, there are people who are anti-abortion. Not just people who wouldnâ€™t have it for themselves. They want no one to have it. Thereâ€™s a small percentage that are really militant. Of those, thereâ€™s a small percentage that are fuckingâ€¦ Thereâ€™s ones in America that are like terrorists. They bomb abortion clinics, put fetuses through your door, and theyâ€™ve got this propaganda machine that goes, â€œLiberals, theyâ€™re aborting babies at nine months, pulling them out of the vagina, liquidizing them.â€ Like, crazy conspiracy theory, right? And now theyâ€™ve got the Internet. So theyâ€™ve got fonts and memes. Itâ€™s like science to them. And this thing goes round. Youâ€™ve probably seen it. It goesâ€¦ Iâ€™ve heard different derivations of it, like, â€œThis was a real lecture,â€ or, â€œThis was a real questionnaire.â€ Nonsense. Itâ€™s all made-up. It goes like this. â€œA woman is pregnant. She already has five children.â€ â€œTwo are deaf. Two are blind.â€ â€œOne is mentally retarded.â€ â€œShe has syphilis. Should she have the baby?â€ â€œNo?â€ â€œWell done. Youâ€™ve just killed Beethoven.â€
[audience laughing]
What are you talkingâ€¦ That makes no fucking sense at all. Okay, keep it fair. Letâ€™s do the opposingâ€¦ So, okay, thereâ€™s another woman. Sheâ€™s pregnant. Two children, great hearing, great eyesight, really smart. She hasnâ€™t got syphilis. Should she have the baby? Yes? Well done. You just gave birth to Hitler.
[audience laughing]
Now, I donâ€™t wanna divide the room, but Iâ€™m not a fan of Hitler. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Hear me out. Iâ€™ve got my reasons. Listen, listen, listen. And itâ€™s sci-fi. Whenever I see a sci-fi series, thereâ€™s always one where they invent the time machine and they go back in in time and try to kill Hitler. And if theyâ€™re successful, they come back to the present, and itâ€™s worse â€™cause theyâ€™ve mucked up the time-space continuum. Of course it is. You change the slightest thing in history, it has a catastrophic effect. I wouldnâ€™t change anything, even if I could. My lifeâ€™s too good. I canâ€™t take that chance. Know what I mean?
[audience laughing]
If scientists came to me and went, â€œWeâ€™ve sorted it.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t have to go back in time. Just press this button.â€ â€œIt kills Hitler before the Holocaust, before the war.â€ â€œThe present is exactly the same, except it makes you a bit more ginger,â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œNo.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWhy should I suffer?â€
[audience laughing]
But whenever you see one of those fluff pieces, whenever they askÂ in one of those questionnaires celebrities do, thereâ€™s, â€œWhatâ€™s the first thing youâ€™d do if you had a time machine?â€ They all say, â€œOh, Iâ€™d go back and kill Hitler.â€ Really? Youâ€™d go backÂ and buy Microsoft shares, you fucking liar, right?
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™ve interviewed people on my radio show in America, and I always ask that question for a laugh, and they all say, â€œOh, Iâ€™d go back and kill Hitler.â€ I go, â€œPeople tried at the time.â€ And now they say, â€œOh no, Iâ€™d go back and kill him when he was a baby.â€ So youâ€™d go back and find baby Hitler, right, who hasnâ€™t done anything wrong yet, and just strangle him?
[audience laughing]
Also, have you seen Hitler when he was a baby? Oh my God, absolutely adorable. Look at that.
[audience laughing]
Look at his little face!
[audience laughing]
Youâ€™d go back, and youâ€™d go, â€œIs that Hitler?â€ â€œYeah.â€ Youâ€™d go, â€œOh, you little Nazi, you!â€
[audience laughing]
I know what youâ€™re thinking. Why have I got a picture ofâ€¦ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
â€¦baby Hitler on my phone? Thatâ€™s my business. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
What if I do masturbate over it?
[audience laughing]
What? What if thatâ€™s the only thing I masturbate over? Thereâ€™s no victim, no crime. You could call the police now, have them come to my house, and theyâ€™d say, â€œWe heard you admitted youâ€™re a nonce.â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œYeah, but only for pictures of dead baby Hitler,â€ right? Iâ€™d go, â€œCheck the rule book.â€ And theyâ€™d go, â€œYeah, good as gold.â€
[audience laughing]
Right. â€œDo you wanna see where I masturbate?â€ â€œYeah, go on.â€ So I take them down to the wanktorium, right?
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s basically a converted wine cellar. But itâ€™s that picture blown up 100 times, right, just around the walls, like that, dripping with 40 years of come.
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™ve only lived there five years, so I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
That wonâ€™t be in. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
No, but, uh, people do have a problem with Hitler. Umâ€¦ [Ricky laughs]
[audience laughing]
They wanna go back and kill him, and I say, â€œChill.â€ â€œHitler is the man who killed Hitler, inâ€™t he?â€ Give him his due. Due. D-U-E.
[audience laughing]
I donâ€™t worry about dying. Umâ€¦ Or I donâ€™t worry about being dead â€™cause I wonâ€™t know about it. That is the best thing about being dead. You donâ€™t know about it. Itâ€™s the same as being stupid, right?
[audience laughing]
Itâ€™s only painful for others, right? I worry about how I die. I donâ€™t wanna die alone in agony, or I donâ€™t wanna be found in a wardrobe hanging by a belt, wearing ladiesâ€™ tights, covered in amyl nitrate, know what I mean? Iâ€™m not into that shit, so if I am found like that, just know that one of my mates has stitched me up, right?
[audience laughing]
I donâ€™t worry about dying. I donâ€™t do anything towards not dying, if you know what I mean. I eat and drink too much every day, have done for 40 years. Day and night, I eat and drink too much. People say to me, â€œRick, if you gave up the booze, youâ€™d live an extra ten years.â€ I go, â€œBut theyâ€™re the last ten years, the shit ten years.â€ I donâ€™t want them, right? If I gave up booze now and IÂ made it to 80 and someone said, â€œYou can have an extra ten years,â€ if I could go, â€œOh, great, Iâ€™ll have 20 to 30 again,â€ thatâ€™d be perfect, but, no, you gotta have 80 to 90. Have you any idea how awful it is being 90, right? Iâ€™ve seen 90-year-olds sitting in an armchair, and they go, â€œArgh!â€ And you go, â€œWhat?â€ They go, â€œIâ€™ve broken every bone in my body!â€ â€˜Cause theyâ€™re brittle. Theyâ€™ve got dust for blood. They bruise up blood clots. They got hernias popping out everywhere, right? If youâ€™re 90 years old and you get to the kitchen by yourself to make a cup of tea, if you lift that kettle and itâ€™s too full, thereâ€™s a very good chance your stomachâ€™ll come out of your arsehole.
[audience laughing]
So eat and drink as much as you want and just fucking die is my advice.
[audience cheering and applauding]
Thank you. [laughs] I should say Iâ€™m not a doctor. [laughing]
[audience laughing]
I do see a doctor once a year or once every two years. I have to have medicals for things like this and TV shows, and, uh, I go private, right? Itâ€™s 600 quid. Itâ€™s three hours long. But they do everything. Blood sample, stool sample, urine sample, ECG, ears, nose, throat, bollocks, the finger. Everything, right? And you have to fill out this big form, write a lifestyle thing. That takes fucking ages. I tell the truth, except units of alcohol. I work those out, then I halve them, right?
[audience laughing]
And when he gets to those, he still goes, â€œThatâ€™s an awful lot.â€
[audience laughing]
And I think Iâ€™ve won. I go, â€œIs it?â€
[audience laughing]
And, uh, at the end of the three hours, theyâ€™ve got all the results back from the lab, and heâ€™s got this big computerâ€¦ Itâ€™s like body composition. And from there, they work out your percentage chance of a stroke, heart attack in one year, five years, ten years, and mineâ€™s always about the same. It always gets worse with age. Nothing you can do about that. But Iâ€™m always likeâ€¦ Iâ€™m at the end of healthy weight. Iâ€™m just nearly obese. Iâ€™m just right, oh, like that. I was prediabetic once. I had to sort that out. And now Iâ€™m pre-gout, right?
[audience laughing]
Pre-gout, right? And so he tells you all that and goes, â€œSo, what are we gonna do about this?â€ And I wanna go, â€œWhat do you mean, â€˜weâ€™?â€ â€œIâ€™ve just made you 600 quid, mate, right?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYouâ€™re gonna fix it, and Iâ€™m gonna carry on.â€ You donâ€™t take a car to the garage and he goes, â€œTires are bald.â€ â€œBig endâ€™s gone. What are we gonna do?â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna fix it, mate, and Iâ€™m gonna pay you.â€
[audience laughing]
He went, â€œYou need more fiber in your diet.â€ I wanted to go, â€œGet me wine with fiber in it, then.â€ â€œI can afford anything. You must be able to invent that.â€ He said, â€œYouâ€™re heavily constipated.â€ I wanted to go, â€œGet in there with a spoon, son.â€
[audience laughing]
And then they always leave it right to the end. They donâ€™t even look up. They go, â€œAnd can I give you a rectal exam?â€ Which means I have to go, â€œYes, please.â€ I justâ€¦ I want them to surprise me on the way out. â€œBye.â€ â€œBye.â€ â€œAnd thatâ€™s fine.â€ â€œThank you.â€
[audience laughing]
But thereâ€™s a big build-up. And as theyâ€™re washing their hands, theyâ€™ve gotta say, â€œOh, um, would you like a chaperone?â€ So youâ€™re gonna have your finger up my arse, and now you got a mate watching? No, just do it.
[audience laughing]
And they lay you on this bench, on your back to start with, pants and trousers round your ankles, knees apart like a little frog.
[audience laughing]
And they do the balls first, right. And Iâ€™m nervous at a doctor, Iâ€™m really nervous, so Iâ€™ve got no balls, right?
[audience laughing]
He has to dig them out like a tortoiseâ€™s head, know what I mean? Itâ€™s just like a little fist of fear down there. Itâ€™sâ€¦ [laughs] And I fucking hate it. I goâ€¦ [gagging] Like that, right?
[audience laughing]
I stillâ€¦ Itâ€™s horrible, right? And then they turn you on the side and lube you up and goâ€¦ the finger up the arse. Thatâ€™s great. Not great. Thatâ€™s not why I go, butâ€¦
[audience laughing]
â€œMe again.â€ â€œYou were here yesterday.â€Â â€œCome on.â€
[audience laughing]
But this one time, it was an old man, andâ€¦ It was still a doctor, not just an old man.
[audience laughing]
â€œDoctor said he couldnâ€™t make it, so I thought Iâ€™dâ€¦ Iâ€™d have a go.â€
[audience laughing]
There was a sort of, like,Â old-school GP. He was about 75, little shirt and tie, tweed jacket. And he was sitting on an armchair, and he didnâ€™t put me on the bench. I was just standing up, and he went, â€œJust pop your pants and trousers down.â€ So I justâ€¦ So he was littleâ€¦ So he was head-height to my balls, and, as I say, Iâ€™m nervous at the doctor, so I jabber. I talk. I think, â€œIf I put â€™em off, they wonâ€™t find the cancer.â€ And so he started doing the balls, and I went, â€œWhat are you looking for there, exactly?â€ And they usually go, â€œShush,â€ and they goâ€¦ And he didnâ€™t. He went, â€œThatâ€™s a good question.â€ And he sat back, and he started telling me all about cancer. So now Iâ€™m just having a chat, right?
[audience laughing]
And he went on for ages. He was loving it, right? And I remember it felt rude to do that, so I was going, â€œOh, right, right.â€
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing]
I do work out a bit. Um, I actually joined a gym, literally on my road, I discovered. Iâ€™ve got a gym in my house. I got bored with that. I, uhâ€¦ But I thought, â€œIf I join the gym, if I pay a year in advance, Iâ€™ll try and get value for money. Thatâ€™ll make me go.â€ Then I remembered, â€œOh, Iâ€™m fucking rich. It doesnâ€™tâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
I could join a different gym every day for a laugh. Just go along and go, â€œThereâ€™s Â£2,000.â€ â€œSee you tomorrow.â€ â€œYouâ€™ll never see me again.â€
[audience laughing]
And, uh, I go about once a month, and I sort of do ten minutes on the machines, and I run home, like that. I donâ€™t use the changing rooms. Iâ€™ve got a thing about public changing rooms. I always have, and Iâ€™ll tell you why. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the same in ladiesâ€™ changing rooms, but men are so proud of their offal, right? If Iâ€™m in a public place, I have a shower, one minute, towel, corner, pants on, right? Thereâ€™s blokes walking around naked before the shower, talking. â€œHow you doing?â€ After the shower. There was one bloke in the shower way too long. He took ages, right? And he got out, no towel, just dripping wet, just went up to the mirror and started doing his hair first.
[audience laughing]
There was me and this really fat bloke once in the changing room. I was getting changed, and he was really big. Like, 350 pounds, right? And he was naked on one of those precision scales. And he was there for fucking ages like that, and I wasâ€¦ He was like that for ages. I wanted to run over and go, â€œMate, youâ€™ll never be an astronaut.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œIt doesnâ€™t need to be this accurate. â€œJust pop some pants on and take a fucking gram off.â€
Iâ€™m not having a go at fat people. As I say, Iâ€™m fat. Iâ€™m overweight. Know why? â€˜Cause I eat and drink too much. Thatâ€™s what does it. I donâ€™t judge fat people. I just know how they got fat. If I see a fat person, I go, â€œWell done,â€ you know? â€œYouâ€™ve eaten way more than youâ€™ll ever need, same as me,â€ right? If I see a fat couple, I go, â€œYeah, that works,â€ right? But then as theyâ€™re walking along and you see their little fat toddlers and you go, â€œAw, thatâ€™s not fair,â€ right?
[audience laughing]
And the mother always goes, â€œThey love cake.â€ â€˜Course they love cake! Theyâ€™re baby mammals. Weâ€™re the same species as we were, like, 200,000 years ago. Weâ€™ve got a hunter-gatherer brain, right? All this affluence is so much faster than our human biology. So when you get one of those cakes from the supermarket thatâ€™s packed with fats and sugar, your brain goes, â€œFucking hell, thatâ€™s amazing!â€ â€œKeep eating that. There might not be food tomorrow.â€ But there will be food tomorrow. The fridge is full, and your mumâ€™s on the phone to Ocado. Know what I mean?
[audience laughing]
Now thereâ€™s even a stigma. Doctors get in trouble for saying to someone, â€œYouâ€™re overweight.â€ No, thatâ€™s a politicalâ€¦ No, itâ€™s like fat shaming. You donâ€™t get cancer shaming. Heâ€™s trying to save your life. There was a school that tried to ban the word â€œobeseâ€ â€™cause they said it was derogatory toâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what to call â€™em. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Round children, right?
[audience laughing]
But thatâ€™s the polite word. Thatâ€™s the word we invented so we didnâ€™t say â€œfat little fucker.â€ Donâ€™tâ€¦ Donâ€™t keep changing words â€™cause one person gets offended. Also, fat people arenâ€™t offended by the word â€œobese.â€ They did it all. Theyâ€™re jolly, arenâ€™t they? Theyâ€™re jolly. You see a fat boy, you go, â€œAll right, fatty?â€ [laughing] â€œYeah, yeah, yeah!â€
[audience laughing]
[laughing] â€œOh yeah!â€ Blop, blop, blop. [laughing] â€œYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!â€ And they go to the doctor. â€œCome in.â€ [laughs] Blop. [laughs] Doctor goes, â€œFuck me.â€ Oh. [laughs] â€œAm I obese?â€ [laughing] â€œNo, youâ€™re morbidly obese.â€ [laughing]
[audience laughing]
â€œWhat does that mean?â€ [laughs] â€œMeans youâ€™ll die of it.â€ â€œOh, does it?â€ â€œAll right.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWhat, straight away, orâ€¦â€ â€œNo, youâ€™ve got diabetes, so youâ€™ll have your legs amputated soon.â€ â€œAnd if you carry on, youâ€™ll die later of stroke and respiratory, heart failure.â€ â€œOh, right.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œIs there anything I can do?â€ â€œOf course. Start working out and eat healthy.â€ â€œYouâ€™ll be right as rain.â€ â€œOh, right.â€ â€œBut you wonâ€™t, will ya?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œNo. No.â€ I feel sorry for them, even though itâ€™s their fault. When you see one of those documentaries on telly, like The 600 Pound Man or summat, and heâ€™s being winched out of his house to go to hospital, right? If youâ€™re dangling from a crane, rightâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Right?
[audience laughing]
And you see a film crew, rightâ€¦
[audience laughing]
[Ricky sighs] â€¦you know you fucked it.
[audience laughing]
And then, you know, as I say, they wake up the next day. Theyâ€™ve had their legs amputated. Itâ€™s really sad, and theyâ€™re crying, and Iâ€™m crying. Theyâ€™re going, â€œWhy did I let it go this far? Iâ€™m so stupid.â€ Then they get philosophical about it, and they go, â€œI never really used the legs, soâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
And by then, itâ€™s lunchtime, and soâ€¦
[audience laughing]
And they go to the nurse, â€œDidnâ€™t throw them legs away, did you?â€ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
Guys, do you ever act more working class around builders?
[audience laughing]
I do. I can be walking around leafy Hampstead, right. Book of poems, right.
[audience laughing]
Scarf, right.
[audience laughing]
Just humming Brahms, right.
[audience laughing]
And some scaffolders go, â€œRicky!â€ â€œAll right, cunts! How you doinâ€™, boys?â€
[audience laughing]
And I donâ€™t know why I do it. [laughing] I donâ€™t know whyâ€¦ why I try and impress them. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated with human behavior, right? But as I said at the beginning, weâ€™re the only speciesÂ that allows the universe to understand itself. But we see all nature through our eyes, so it all comes back to us. Why are we here? What makes us? Is it our genetics or the environment? The old nature versus nurture argument. The psychologist Piaget was once asked, â€œWhatâ€™s more important for the intellect of a person? Nature or nurture?â€ And he replied, â€œWhatâ€™s more important for the area of a field?â€ â€œLength or width?â€ All right, if you donâ€™t know the answer, just fuckingâ€¦
[audience laughing]
But psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, itâ€™s still in its infancy, and we still know so little about the brain. And 150 years ago,Â we knew nothing. It was justâ€¦ It was all guesswork, right? And, uh, like, everything was just mental. If you werenâ€™t a white, heterosexual, married, Christian man, right, if you deviated too far, â€œMental.â€ They just went, â€œMental,â€ like that. Homosexuality? â€œMental. Mental illness.â€ You were put in an asylum for life, or worse, tortured. Women who fell pregnant out of wedlock, â€œMental.â€ Asylum for life, right? And now we understand things more. Weâ€™re more tolerant. Weâ€™reâ€¦ I think itâ€™s going too far the other way, though, because now nothingâ€™s mental. You canâ€™t find summat that someoneâ€™sâ€¦ Nothing is considered mental. Everything is a syndrome or an addiction or a preference, right? I could have my legs removed, have wheels put on, identify as a pram, rightâ€¦
[audience laughing]
And if you say Iâ€™m mental, youâ€™re a bigot, right?
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s a bit hack, that joke, now, isnâ€™t it? â€œIdentify as a thing, then.â€ Itâ€™s a bit old-fashioned, but Iâ€™m gonna leave it in to annoy people, right? Because thatâ€™s the bit thatâ€™ll offend people. Same as humanity. I talk about AIDS, famine, cancer, the Holocaust, rape, pedophilia, but the one thingÂ you mustnâ€™t joke about is identity politics. The one thing you should never joke about is the trans issue. â€œThey just wanna be treated equally.â€ I agree. Thatâ€™s why I include them.
[audience laughing]
You know?
[audience cheering and applauding]
But they know Iâ€™m joking about all the other stuff, but they go, â€œNo, he must mean that,â€ right? Like a joke is a window to the comedianâ€™s true soul. Itâ€™s justâ€¦ Thatâ€™s just not the case. Iâ€™ll take on any view to make the joke funniest. Iâ€™ll pretend to be right wing. Iâ€™ll pretend to be left wing. Iâ€™ll pretend to be clever. Iâ€™ll pretend to be stupid. Whatever makes the joke funnier, without prejudice. Okay, full disclosure. In real life, of course I support trans rights. I support all human rights, and trans rights are human rights. Live your best life. Use your preferred pronouns. Be the gender that you feel that you are. But meet me halfway, ladies. Lose the cock. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m saying.
[audience laughing and applauding]
Thatâ€™s allâ€¦
[audience applauding]
[audience laughing]
And itâ€™s mad to think joking about summat means youâ€™re anti-it. Like, I made a joke about self-ID. In fact, I wish self-ID had been around when I was a kid. Iâ€™d have used it to get shit. Iâ€™d have gone to my mum. â€œMum, Iâ€™m trans.â€Â Sheâ€™d have gone, â€œWhat?â€ Iâ€™d have gone, â€œIâ€™m either trans or I need a new bike.â€
[audience laughing]
Sheâ€™d have gone, â€œYou need a new bike.â€
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™d have gone, â€œYouâ€™re the boss.â€
[audience laughing]
But I, uhâ€¦ I grew up in the â€™60s. Jesus. I had, like, Victorian parents. We hadnâ€™t heard of any of this. But what if I was a teenager now in these really woke, progressive times, right, and I had really cool, hippie parents, right, and I went, â€œMother, Father, Iâ€™m transâ€? Theyâ€™d go, â€œOh goody, thatâ€™s so fucking trendy.â€
[audience laughing]
And my dad would go, â€œBagsy I pick the vagina.â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œThank you, Daddy,â€ right? Pfft. Right?
[audience laughing]
Then thereâ€™d be a montage, and Iâ€™d go to hospital. Iâ€™d have all the electrolysis. Iâ€™d grow my hair. Iâ€™d haveâ€¦ Iâ€™d have a big fanny, I think. No. No, if someone else is paying, Iâ€™ll have the big one. Know what I mean? â€œDad trying to buy me with minge. Fuck you, Dad.â€ Right? Big fanny, boobs, right, and, uhâ€¦Â Pfft. Right? [laughing]
[audience laughing]
No, Iâ€™dâ€¦ Iâ€™d come out, and Iâ€™d emerge. Iâ€™d be a real woman. Iâ€™d be Vicky Gervais. Iâ€™d be Vicky Gervais, right?
[audience laughing]
Yeah. No, Iâ€™d be a real woman, right? And you canâ€™t change your sexuality, so I find women attractive, so Iâ€™d beâ€¦ Iâ€™d be a lesbian. Iâ€™d be a little lesbian fella called, um, Vicky Gervais, right? Right? And Iâ€™d probably be a butch lesbian â€™cause of all the testosterone till then. Also, I like the fashion. Jeans, black T-shirt, short hair, beard! No, Iâ€™d beâ€¦ No, Iâ€™d be a real lesbian called Vicky Gervais, lesbian about town, right? And so, Iâ€™d, uhâ€¦ Iâ€™d go down to Brighton, right, and, uh, Iâ€™d go into a lesbian bar, right, and Iâ€™d go, â€œHi.â€ Pool table. Winner stays on. Iâ€™d be there all fucking night. Voom. Right?
[audience laughing]
All right. This joke isnâ€™t worth it for the punchline. The punchline is shit. So just enjoy the journey, right? [laughs] Anyway, so I look around, and I find one of those pretty lesbians. [laughs] This is so childish and misinformed, it hurts. Iâ€™m gonna leave it in though. Right, soâ€¦ No, Iâ€™d find a pretty lesbian. Iâ€™dâ€¦ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
This is pathetic, right? Even for me. I canâ€™t do this with a fucking straight face! Right, right, rightâ€¦ [Ricky laughing] And Iâ€™d go over like that. Iâ€™d go, â€œHi. Are you a lesbian?â€ Sheâ€™d go, â€œYeah. Are you a lesbian?â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œYeah, just a bit. Look at that.â€
[audience laughing]
Sheâ€™d go, â€œThat is a lovely fanny.â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œFucking cost enough.â€ Sheâ€™d go, â€œWhat?â€ â€œNothing.â€ And then Iâ€™d be wooing her, right? Iâ€™d be doing all theâ€¦ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™d be complimenting her on her lezzie ways. Iâ€™d go, uhâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™d go, â€œOh,â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œI love your Doc Martens,â€ right? Sheâ€™d go, â€œOh, thanks.â€ Pfft. Right?
[audience laughing]
[speaking indistinctly]Â Pfft.
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™d go, â€œOh, those are big earrings.â€ â€œYeah.â€ Right? Then sheâ€™d go, â€œWanna come back to my place and lez off?â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œYeah, just a bit.â€ So we go back. We get naked. I boob her up. I donâ€™t know whatâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Minge her off? Iâ€™d do that one. Iâ€™d do that one. Definitely do that one, right? Iâ€™d google it. Iâ€™d fucking google it, right? And Iâ€™dâ€¦ Right. Sheâ€™d go, â€œYou wanna wear a strap-on dildo and give me a good seeing to?â€ Iâ€™d go, â€œYeah.â€ So Iâ€™d put a strap-on on. Iâ€™d put the big dildo there on my new fanny like that and tie it at the back. And thatâ€™s when Iâ€™d kick myself.
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
[Ricky laughing] I told you it was shit, didnâ€™t I tell you? [Ricky laughing] Oh God.
[audience laughing]
Oh. But one thing that isnâ€™t ambiguous whether itâ€™s nature or nurture is racism. No oneâ€™s born racist. Youâ€™ve gotta learn that shit, okay? And, okay, I donâ€™t wanna divide the room. Iâ€™m not a fan of racism. Umâ€¦ No, hear me out, right? Iâ€¦ I donâ€™t careÂ whether youâ€™re Black, white, brown, European, Africanâ€¦ Youâ€™re going, â€œThatâ€™s all right, Black, white, brown, European, African.â€ â€œWhat about the fucking Eskimos?â€ Racist, right? â€œTheyâ€™re fucking weird, Rick.â€ They are not weird, just different. â€œThey live in the snow.â€ Yeah, that is their little house, the snow. So? â€œThey wear a dead sea lion for their cloâ€¦â€ Yes, thatâ€™s their clothes. A dead sea lion. But hereâ€™s the thing about racism. You drag one out of his hole in the snow and peel him out of his sea lion outfit, and heâ€™s standing there naked, you take a closer look. Heâ€™s basically a cold Chinaman.
[audience laughing]
Soâ€¦
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing] I know you canâ€™t say â€œChinamanâ€ anymore, right?
[audience laughing]
I canâ€™t believe you ever could because that is the laziest labeling of a demographic Iâ€™ve ever heard. So the first one lands on our shores, and we gather round, going, â€œWhere are you from?â€ And he goes, â€œChina.â€ And we go, â€œOh, youâ€™re a Chinaman.â€ And he goes, â€œIâ€™m a what?â€ â€œYouâ€™re a Chinaman.â€ â€œA Chinaman?â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s my wife?â€ â€œDuh. Lady Chinaman.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWhy donâ€™t you call me by my name?â€
â€œI donâ€™t know your name, do I?â€
â€œItâ€™s Ling.â€
â€œLing?â€
â€œYeah.â€
â€œIs that your first name or your surname?â€
â€œBoth.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œLing Ling?â€
â€œHerro?â€
[audience laughing]
Right, no. Right. Right.
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughs] Remember, irony. Okay?
[audience laughing]
Also, thatâ€™s not me saying that, is it? Itâ€™s the little Chinaman, innit? Soâ€¦
[audience laughing]
If heâ€™s all right with it, thenâ€¦
[audience laughing]
That wonâ€™t be in. Right, okay.
[audience laughing]
Fucking hell, have I got anything for this fucking special?
[audience laughing]
Oh, this is all right. Right. Umâ€¦
[audience laughing]
Did anyone have a pedo teacher when they were at school? Yes, yeah. Yeah.
[audience laughing]
[laughs] Round of applause for pedo teachers, yeah!
[audience cheering and applauding]
Fucking hell. Unbelievable.
[audience laughing]
Thatâ€™s another thing. I think whereas people are now trying to be so politically correct, theyâ€™re trying to out-woke each other, soon someoneâ€™ll say, â€œYou canâ€™t say â€˜pedoâ€™ anymore.â€ â€œItâ€™s a derogatory term. It offends people who are child-addicted,â€ right? So youâ€™re gonna have people going to the doctor going, â€œDoctor, I think Iâ€™m child-addicted.â€ Right? The doctorâ€™ll go, â€œOh, you poor thing. How do you feel?â€ â€œI feel like I wanna fiddle with kids.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œThat is one of the symptoms.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œDonâ€™t worry. Sit down.â€ â€œWeâ€™ll get you into a facility at taxpayersâ€™ expense, and weâ€™ll wean you off children.â€ â€œHow does that work doctor?â€ â€œYou know when they give heroin addicts methadone?â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œWell, weâ€™re gonna start you on dwarfs, right?â€ [laughs] â€œIt might work. It mightâ€¦â€ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
â€œIt might work.â€ [Ricky laughing]
[audience laughing]
[laughs]
[audience laughing]
â€œHow does that work?â€ â€œLet me think. I havenâ€™t thought it through.â€ Right, okay. No. Umâ€¦ â€œSo what you do is come into the facility.â€ â€œWeâ€™ve hired loads of dwarfs, and weâ€™re not open during the panto season.â€ â€œWe canâ€™t get the staff.â€ â€œSo youâ€¦ you come inâ€¦ you come in Febâ€¦â€ Shush. â€œYou come in February to November, right?â€
[audience laughing]
â€œWeâ€™ve hired loads of dwarfs, and weâ€™ve dressed them up as schoolchildren, and they just run around the campus like that.â€ [laughs] â€œTheyâ€™re free-range dwarfs.â€
[audience laughing]
â€œTheyâ€™re free-range dwarfs, and they look like theyâ€™re about six years old, but theyâ€™re above legal age. Youâ€™re not breaking the law.â€ â€œTheyâ€™ve been paid. Itâ€™s consensual.â€ â€œYou just go up to one you fancy, pull down his little trousers, fiddleâ€¦â€ â€œHey, Doctor, I said I was a pedo. I didnâ€™t say I was gay.â€ â€œDo you think thereâ€™s, like, homophobia in the pedophile community?â€ Like, one pedophile, heâ€™s all smug. Heâ€™s heterosexual. Heâ€™s abducting a little girl. Heâ€™s taking a little girl into the forest. He sees another pedo with a little boy, and he goes, â€œYou fucking bender.â€
[audience laughing]
Thereâ€™s a London borough that tried to ban registered pedophiles living within one mile of a school. Now, say what you will about pedos, but theyâ€™re not lazy. Know what I mean?
[audience laughing]
A lot of â€™em are bus drivers. Thatâ€™s nothing. [laughs]
[audience laughing]
You know? So this pedo teacher, rightâ€¦ True story, this. It was about 1976. I was about 14. And, uh, looking back, I feel a bit sorry for him â€™cause he was probably late twenties, and he was a nervous sort of guy, and he was obviously gay, and he had a fling with one of the older boys, who might have been 16, 17. So now, would have been totally legal, but then, technically a nonce. Banished. Convicted. Never heard of again. Big scandal, right? And when it broke, I went home that day. My mum was there, and she went, â€œDid he touch you?â€ And I went, â€œNo.â€ She went, â€œYou sure?â€ I went, â€œYeah.â€ She went, â€œHe couldnâ€™t have fancied you, then.â€
[audience laughing]
So now my mum is winding me up about me not being attractive enough to be sexually abused, right? What if I had got a complex? What if I had thought, â€œIâ€™ll show herâ€?
[audience laughing]
Iâ€™d come in at midnight. â€œWhere you been?â€ â€œSucking off bus drivers. Thatâ€™s what you get.â€
[audience laughing]
But that was typical of my mum. My mum, she was the salt of the earth, but she just said what she wanted, right? Sheâ€™d do anything for you, but she reserved the right to moan about it.
So, growing up, our next-door neighbor, Mrs. Dawson, she was about 25 years older than my mum. So when my mum was 60, this old lady was already, like, 85, 86. My mum was the last living witness to her existence. She lived alone. My mum did everything for her. Went shopping for her, did the housework. Made her lunch, sat with her for a while. She went back, made her tea. This went on and on. I remember calling home once. My mum was, like, 70. And I went, â€œI called earlier. You were out.â€ My mum went, â€œI was round Dawsonâ€™s.â€ I went, â€œOh, how is she?â€ My mum wentâ€¦ [sighs] â€œShe just wonâ€™t die, Rick.â€
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing] I have very fond memories of growing up in Reading, um, which is whyâ€¦ Yeah, why I never go back.
[audience laughing]
Wherever I am in the world, I bump into someone from Reading. â€œIâ€™m a Reading boy.â€ â€œOh good.â€ That should be enough, but it never is. They always want more. They say things like, â€œOh yeah, you knows Norman Taylor, donâ€™t you?â€ I never know this person. I go, â€œOh, no.â€ They go, â€œYeah, he knows you.â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™m on the telly, mate. Umâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œYou went to Ashmead School.â€ â€œYeah, yeah, yeah.â€ â€œYou knows Pete Shepherd.â€ â€œWhen was he there?â€ â€œ1993.â€ â€œYeah, I was 31, mate. I wasâ€¦â€
[audience laughing]
â€œHe knows you.â€ â€œDoes he?â€ â€œHas he got a telly?â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œThatâ€™s whatâ€™s happened here.â€
[audience laughing]
But I do like old stories. I donâ€™t tell showbiz stories. Theyâ€™re boring to me. I like real stories. Whenever Iâ€™m working up a tour, I think of things that have happened to me and how my lifeâ€™s changed. And I thought of one for this tour, and it was hugging, right? No oneâ€™s been hugging for the last couple of years, which I preferred. I liked that. I never liked hugging. I liked it when you couldnâ€™t hug. It always felt awkward. I didnâ€™t hug anyone growing up. I didnâ€™t hug anyone till I came to London. A working class kid on an estate in Reading, you donâ€™t hug people. You donâ€™t hug your fucking dad, granddad, or your brother. You wind â€™em up. You take the piss. Thatâ€™s our hug, right? Iâ€™ll give you an example. We were at our dadâ€™s funeral, and I was in the graveyard with my brother Bob. Bob was having a cigarette, and our uncle Mike came along. We hadnâ€™t seen Mike for, like, 25 years. Last time we saw him, he was, like, 50, and now heâ€™s, like, 75. He hadnâ€™t aged well. He was an old man. And he came up to us and went, â€œHello, boys.â€ And Bob sort of looked at him and recognized him and went, â€œFuck me,â€ like that. And then Bob looked around the graveyard and went, â€œIs there any point you going home?â€
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing] Right?
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing] And Uncle Mike laughed and went, â€œAlways nice to see you, Bobby.â€ And that was their hug. Know what I mean?
Iâ€™ll give you another example. When I left school, my best mate was a bloke called Mark. We did everything together. We took a year out before college to earn money to get pissed, really. And we did. It was the best summer ever. And, uhâ€¦ But then summat happened. His, uhâ€¦ His grandmother died, and he livedâ€¦ he lived with her, so it was a big deal. And, uh, he went to the funeral, and the first place he came after the funeral was my house. He sat down in his little black suit, and he was just quiet. I didnâ€™t know what to say. No hugging, right? So I went, â€œHow was it?â€ He went, â€œIt was awful.â€ Said, um, â€œShe was cremated, and we all went outside to watch the smoke go up, and the wind changed, and it all blew in our faces, right?â€
[audience laughing]
And I went, â€œIn your mouth?â€ He went, â€œYeah.â€ I wentâ€¦ I took a chance.
[audience laughing]
I said, â€œDid it taste bitter?â€ And he went, â€œYeah.â€ I went, â€œThat was her clitoris.â€
[audience laughing]
[Ricky laughing] Right?
[audience laughing]
And Mark just went, â€œFucking hell, Rick,â€ like that, right? And then he started laughing. And that was our hug. Do you know what I mean? Oh.
Iâ€™ll leave you with one final story, right? Itâ€™s another true story. If I say theyâ€™re true, they are. I promise, theyâ€™re all true. And, uhâ€¦ My favorite are the school stories, and this is probably my favorite school story ever. It was 1976 again, so, uh, I was about 14, and we had a kid in our class called Gary Masterman. And Gary developed Touretteâ€™s syndrome. Every sentence had a swear word in it. He had a tic. We learned all about it in assembly. Gary was up there. All the teachers, all the kids knew him. He was a popular lad, right. And, umâ€¦ Yeah, nice guy, Gary Masterman. But sometimes his tics seemed relevant. Iâ€™ll never forget, we were having this lesson with a young female teacher called Miss Wilkie. She was at the blackboard. She was doing calling-out suggestions. Canâ€™t remember what it was about. Sheâ€™d go, â€œSimon, what do you think?â€ â€œYeah, thatâ€™s good. Yes, that works. Brian, what do youâ€¦â€ â€œYeah. Yeah, good. Yeah.â€ And she went, â€œGary.â€ He went, â€œIâ€™ll finger you, miss.â€
[audience laughing]
And she just went, â€œAnyone else?â€
[audience laughing]
And she pointed to Sean Dixon, and Sean went, â€œYeah, Iâ€™ll finger ya.â€
[audience laughing]
Youâ€™ve been amazing. Good night.

She all in the kitchen, butt naked on her tippy toes, looking for batteries.
â€œOh, my god. The feelingâ€™s going away. I need some batteries.â€
All in the kitchen drawers, â€œoh, my god, whereâ€™s the motherf*cking batteries?â€
They finally take the batteries out the remote control.
â€œGet the channel you gonna watch. Put the motherf*cking remote control down. Iâ€™m taking the batteries out of here.â€
[High-pitched buzzing]
They get mad when we got a porno tape in the motherf*cking house.
â€œKeep these b*tches out of my house!â€
Motherf*cking frisbee -threw the motherf*cker.
â€œI donâ€™t know them b*tches. They live in San Diego.â€
Women love to catch a n*gga jacking off.
Thatâ€™s why you got to have the remote control right here on your lap -so you can hit â€œstopâ€ and put your d*ck under your shirt.
â€œWho is that?â€
Son!
Thatâ€™s how women walk in the door on your ass â€” just like this.
â€œWhat are you doing?â€

This is how they come around the corner like this.
â€œCaught your ass, didnâ€™t I? Smell funny in here.â€
â€œWhat it supposed to smell like? My balls is out. Cherries?â€
And, ladies, you got to watch these men.
Just â€™cause a n*gga got money donâ€™t mean he got his d*ck cut right when he was a baby.
N*gga pull his d*ck out, and motherf*cker got a turtleneck.
â™ª I think this brother got a turtleneck â™ª
â€œGirl, he got money, but he got blanket lint on his d*ck.
What do I do?
What do I do?â€
Iâ€™m feeling good, motherf*cker.
We got a black president.

[Cheers and applause]
I feel like I can sell weed right in the middle of the street.

Look at that little walk he got.
You see that little walk?
I seen him almost fall one time.
See, this n*ggaâ€™s a pimp right here.
Lips purple -he smoking them grape swisher sweets?
Look at his lips.

Oh, he somewhere right now with his shirt off, eating chicken wings, counting his money.
â€œOh, I raked up pretty good.â€
He just look at you with that little smirk like that.
You know how bush look at you, like, â€œyou know I f*cked you. But what you gonna do about it? Nothing!â€
They tried to f*ck Obamaâ€™s oath up.
You see when he had his hand up?
He had to stop and look at the man like, â€œIâ€™ll slap the shit out you up here if you mess my shit up. Try to read my oath with a now and later in your mouth.â€
You know Obamaâ€™s real.
He getting them threatening calls, too.
He got the same pressure of a n*gga that got 30 kilos in the basement.
[Imitates telephone ringing]
â€œhello?â€
â€œIâ€™m gonna kill you, n*gga.â€
â€œHello?!â€
â€œIâ€™m gonna kill you, motherf*cker. You think you the shit.â€

[Laughter and applause]
I know who it is, Michelle. Itâ€™s Jesse Jackson. Stop playing on my f*cking phone. No, you canâ€™t come to the white house, n*gga. Trying to call me a b*tch on the mike one night.â€
They caught Jesseâ€™s ass hating on him.
â€œTalk about suck my d*ck, n*gga.â€
They caught Jesse. Caught you, didnâ€™t they, Jesse?
He sitting up there at the inauguration, crying, like he just so happy, looking like a drunk-ass Pekinese, justâ€¦ â€œman, that sure was supposed to be me. Keep hope alive.â€
Heâ€™s just a rotten motherf*cker, man.
You got Martin Luther King shot, man.
Pop!
â€œWatch out, king! Goddamn it! Get out the way!â€
â€œJesse, they was after you.â€
â€œI know who it was. I know that. I tried to f*ck his wife. Letâ€™s get out of here.â€
Ah, shit.

Look at white people. â€œI donâ€™t act like that. My son doesnâ€™t do that.â€
You come home from school, little Timmy in the garage making a bomb.
â€œWhat are you doing, Timmy?â€ â€œNothing, mom! Get out of here now! Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re f*cking out of here!â€
You ainâ€™t never heard of a little black kid killing they mama, have you? â€˜Cause there will be a shootout in that mother. You know, black mothers got instincts like they in Vietnam.

[laughing]
Iâ€™m a n*gga just like yâ€™all. I got lucky and got in show business.
I got three baby mamas, four felonies.
Didnâ€™t graduate from high school, grew up poor on the motherfuckinâ€™ food stamps.
Yeah, we grew up on food stamps.
Yeah, you remember them food stamps.
But sometimes your mama would sell â€™em to get her hair done.
â€œIâ€™m gonna get my hair done this month. I ainâ€™t gonna fall like that. Yâ€™all ainâ€™t gonna do me like that this month.â€
She sell some of the food stamps, weâ€™d be hungry that last week.
â€œSomething ainâ€™t panning out. Your hair look good, but we hungrier than a motherfucker these last four days.â€
Sometimes, the mailman be late with the food stamps.
My motherâ€™d go tell, â€œGo look for him. Go find the mailman.â€
[chuckles]
Iâ€™d be on that bicycle, riding like a motherfucker, looking for him.
My brotherâ€™d be on the handle bars like this.
I tried to sell cocaine, man. I ainâ€™t bullshitting, I did.
I tried to sell it, but I was an unsuccessful thug.
A n*gga fronted me a kilo one time, I ainâ€™t know how to get rid of it.
I didnâ€™t know who to sell it to.
I went to my auntie and said, â€œYou know anybody who do dope?â€
â€˜Cause you know, if you give a n*gga an eight-ball, he gonna turn it into what?
A quarter ounce.
The quarter ounce gonna turn into what? A half ounce.
The half gonna turn into a whole ounce.
The whole ounce gonna turn into two. The two gonna turn into four.
Now, the four gonna turn into more.
You got a quarter key. You got nine ounces.
Whatâ€™s that nine gonna turn into?
Eighteen.
Eighteen gonna turn into what? Thirty-sixâ€¦
Look at the drug-dealer n*ggas in here. N*gga said, â€œThirty-six.â€
I tried to sell cocaine in the â€™90sâ€¦ when n*ggas was on the corner with the dope under their motherfucking mouths like thisâ€¦
[muffled] â€œThem police round here like a motherfucker. Iâ€™m swallowing this shit, police ride up on me, n*gga. [muttering incomprehensibly] I ainâ€™t got nothing. As soon as they roll up, Iâ€™m swallowing this shit.â€
You remember n*ggas sold cocaine in the â€™90s?
Theyâ€™d bring white people in the neighborhood. [chuckles]
But theyâ€™d tell the white people, â€œStay in the car. Iâ€™m gonna go over there and get it for you. Stay in the car. Donâ€™t talk to nobody.â€
Itâ€™d be a white couple sitting in the car, sweating.
â€œAll right, go ahead.â€
Thatâ€™s when the n*gga go in the projects.
N*gga walk in the projects.
â€œAll right, look. I got the white people sitting in the car around the corner, okay? They got $150. They want to spend it. They want an eight-ball right now. But they got the money. They spending all weekend. Okay, now put itâ€¦ Okay, now do something for me now. Now give me something. Do something for me now. Shit. I done risked my life out there. Do something for me now. Show me something.â€

About an hour later, here come the n*gga again.
â€œOkay, they ready again. Okay, they got a ten-speed, $200 and aâ€¦ and a cable box. They ready.â€
Later on that night, here come the white people by theyself.

[laughs]
Yeah, itâ€™s a lot of n*ggas in here. Yâ€™all better watch the police. Shit.
â€˜Cause the policeâ€™ll put a hurtinâ€™ on your ass, Jack.
No, for real.
And white people be talking about, â€œThose n*ggers are resisting arrest.â€
How the fuck a n*gga resisting arrest?
Fuck that. You donâ€™t even see the police.
You just be riding and one n*gga say, â€œYou know the police behind us?â€
Thatâ€™s when you find out whoâ€™s going to jail.
When your buddy say, â€œMan, you know I ainâ€™t go to court that time.â€
â€œWell, you goinâ€™ in the morning, n*gga, if they pull us over.â€
The n*gga in the back seat, â€œI got some pills in my pocket.â€
â€œYou better eat â€™em, motherfucker.
You better not leave nary a Fruity Pebble in my back seat.â€
And jailâ€™s the wrong place to be on ecstasy at, ainâ€™t it?
You in there in the cell, sweating and horny as hell.
[audience laughing]
Your fucking head fall off your shit.

And when you go to jail, ainâ€™t nobody did nothing in jail.

â€œDid you know yourâ€“â€œ
â€œWhen?â€

Put the head back on it.
Mexicans ainâ€™t got no license, registration, nothing.
Police pull them over, â€œLicense and registration.â€
â€œYes.â€
â€œDo you have a license and registration?â€
â€œYes.â€
â€œStep out the car.â€
â€œNo, no, no.â€

â€œGet out the fuckinâ€™ car.â€
And white people get out of the car when the police get out.

â€œYou want to tell me why the fuck you just pulled me over back there?
Get your fuckinâ€™ hands off me!
Donâ€™t fuckinâ€™ touch me like that!
Get in the car, Rebecca.
Donâ€™t put your fuckinâ€™ hands on me. I donâ€™t give a fuck!â€
Thatâ€™s the booger move right there.
You ever see a n*gga in your car doing that? N*gga likeâ€¦
How many of yâ€™all ever wiped a booger on your friendâ€™s car seat?
Donâ€™t lie, motherfuckers.

Ladies, yâ€™all need to start sharing that pussy.

You think â€™cause itâ€™s with you all the time that itâ€™s yours all the time.

I canâ€™t go to God with no money, man.
Heâ€™s tired of hearing n*ggas coming to him, broke.
Yeah, thatâ€™s what n*ggas say, man.
â€œIâ€™m coming to you, God, but I gotta get this money first. I got three more pounds to get off. I gotta fuck with the devil for two more months. And after that, Iâ€™m coming to you. See me through the bad that you do.â€
Yeah.
I tried to be a Muslim one time and got caught with a ham sandwich the third day I was in it.
They was like, â€œBrother, brother, brother, what kind of sandwich is that?â€
I said, â€œI was just fittinâ€™ telling you, I quit. I donâ€™t wanna do this shit no more. And take this fuckinâ€™ flying saucer off my head.â€
[audience clapping]

Peed in the bed.
I was in special classes.

I was in special ed from the first to the twelfth.
I was a senior in high school and never switched classes, that isâ€¦ Thatâ€™s humiliating right there, man.
The bell rings, â€œSit back down.â€ I said, â€œB*tch, the bell just rang.â€
â€œThatâ€™s not your bell, Michael.â€
â€œWhenâ€™s my bell?â€
â€œAt the end of the day.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah.â€
â€œPut your helmet on.â€
I said, â€œI ainâ€™t putting no fuckinâ€™ helmet on, b*tch.â€
[audience laughing]
When you in them special classes, other kids be walking past the room, looking in the room.
I got a buddy in a wheelchair want to be a pimp, talkinâ€™ about, â€œLook, there go some b*tches. Take me out the chair and set me on the hood of the car.â€
I saidâ€¦ â€œNow, what the fuck is that gonna do? Itâ€™s gonna make you more pimp-ish or something, n*gga, â€™cause you sittinâ€™â€¦â€
The air out of all this n*ggaâ€™s legs. This n*gga on the car like this.
The legs flat on the car. All this swelled up.
I knew what was gonna happen.
My buddy said, â€œWatch out, get him, get him.â€
This n*gga was sliding down the hood of the car.
I said, â€œOh, Lord.â€
[audience laughing]
It was a Cadillac. The emblem caught that n*ggaâ€™s shirt.
His mother was mad. [chuckles]
â€œWhat the fuck yâ€™all put him on the goddamn car for?â€
Yeah, man, I was watching Good Morning America with my mother, and 2 Chainz was rapping, and my mother said, â€œWhoo! Whoopi Goldberg rapping now.â€
I said, â€œMama, that is not no goddamn Whoopi Goldberg.â€
I talk about all the entertainers, and then when I see â€™em, I act like I ainâ€™t said nothing about â€™em.
â€œMan, whatâ€™s happeninâ€™?â€
â€œNo, thatâ€™s that bullshit, Mike. I seen you on your thing. I seen you on your thing, man.â€
Yeah, I talk about everybody.
I was talking about Stevie Wonder one time.
And that motherfucker walked on RnB Live. I was like, â€œOh, Lord.â€
But I stopped being nervous. I was like, â€œHe donâ€™t know Iâ€™m in here.
Why should I let him fuck my night up?â€
But one of his fuckinâ€™ managers or something told on me.
I sat there and watched the n*ggaâ€™s lips.
He talkinâ€™ about, â€œThere go Mike, right there.â€
Stevie looking for me now, and this n*gga like thisâ€¦
â€œWhereâ€™s he at? Whereâ€™s he at?â€
Talkinâ€™ about, â€œStevie want to talk to you, Mike.â€
Iâ€™m trying to walk out, he talkinâ€™ about, â€œWhatâ€™s up, Day-day?â€
Iâ€™m mad now. I was like, â€œSteve, you better get out my face before you see for the first time. Iâ€™m fittinâ€™ to unblind your ass right now.â€
â€œAll these beautiful songs Iâ€™ve been making up for many years, you wanna talk shit?â€
[audience laughing]
This n*gga tried to hit me. I said, â€œThis n*gga swung on me?â€
I told him, â€œYeah, Iâ€™d be mad at that beautician for letting you walk out of there with them braids starting right here. Where they do that at, where the braids start right here in back?â€
He got to wash his face way up here and come down.
[chuckling]
Yeah, for real. Shit.
â€˜Cause I like when old men get in a fight. They be nervous as hell.
When old men get in a fight, there be change all over the floor.
There be, like, $1.80 on the ground.
Kids be like, â€œThey was fighting like a motherfucker.â€
â€˜Cause thatâ€™s how them old men who can fight get into it, you know.
One of them old n*ggas named Pat Henry walk up in the pool hall.
â€œYeah, whatâ€™s going on, man? Whatâ€™s this shit I heard, you supposed to had aâ€¦ You supposed to had aâ€¦ [stutters] took an alternator from me over here on 30th Street the other night?â€
â€œMan, ainâ€™t nobody doneâ€¦â€ [mutters incomprehensibly]

Thatâ€™s how them old men attack, real quick.
â€œLower yourâ€“ N*gga, I kill your ass in here. Get him on the ground, Tony.â€
I went to a strip club in LA the other day, Starz.
[audience cheering]
No, never again. These b*tchesâ€¦
There wasnâ€™t one star in there.
These Billy Bob Thornton-looking-ass b*tchesâ€¦
You know youâ€™re in a ghetto strip club when the DJ stops the music and says,
â€œLaquitia, your grandmama outside waiting on you. Laquitia, your grandmotherâ€™s outside waiting on you.â€
Them white strip clubs, they real smooth.
â€œThatâ€™s right, folks. Coming to the stageâ€¦ She goes by the name of Lexus. Thatâ€™s right, fellas. Two-drink minimum, Sexy Wednesdays.â€
[imitating dance music]
Skinny-ass white girl come out there with a baggy thong on.
[imitating music continues]
Thong just dangling in the crack of her ass, like, â€œYeah.â€
[laughs]
Yeah, my whole family think Iâ€™m funny but my grandmother.
Everybody be laughing in the house, and then my grandmother says, â€œHe ainâ€™t that funny to me.â€
I said, â€œWhoâ€™s funny to you?â€
She said, â€œBill Cosby.â€
[audience] Oh!
â€œHe gave me some tea.â€
I said, â€œAnd what happened?â€
She said, â€œI donâ€™t remember.â€
Yeah, my grandmother used to sit on the toilet like this with a cigarette.
[laughs]
And just open her legs and thump the ashes out.
[imitates thumping]
Sometimes sheâ€™d lift her whole ass up. Pow! Pow!
My grandmotherâ€™d call the police on everybody in the hood and then come down there with a nightgown on.
â€œWhat happened down here? What happened?â€
Every time I tell my grandmother Iâ€™m about to go, she say, â€œYeah, let the Lord bless you, or the mortuaryâ€™s gonna dress you.â€
I saidâ€¦ â€œWhat kind of shit do you say to somebody walking out the door?â€
But see, my grandmother, sheâ€™s a great woman, you know.
And I know sheâ€™s going to heaven.
[playing gentle melody]
Yeah.
And a lot of you think youâ€™re going to heaven, but youâ€™re not.
[audience laughs]
You see, when God calls your crooked Christian-ass homeâ€¦ the spirit is gonna leave your body and go into a 30-minute orientation.
And in that orientation, thatâ€™s when that beautiful angelâ€™s gonna float down and give you some paperwork to fill out.
â€œAnd donâ€™t lie, motherfucker. This is going straight to God.â€
And when they go to God, they say, â€œGodâ€¦ the first manâ€™s here.â€
â€œLet him in.â€
â€œItâ€™s a Mexican.â€
[Latin dance music playing]
[audience cheering]
â€œHola, JesÃºs. My name is JesÃºs, too. And I was wondering, can I bring the rest of my family here with me? I clean your clouds. I put an extension on your wings.â€
â€œYou already snuck 40 of your cousins in here, JesÃºs. And pick all them oranges and Chiclets up off the ground that you dropped. It smells like Fabuloso in here now.â€
[playing gentle melody]
â€œNext man, who is it?â€
â€œItâ€™s an Asian.â€
â€œLet him in.â€
[East Asian music playing]
[exclaims]
â€œGod. You are very, very good God. I want to know if you have a beauty supply store up there. I like to sell all your black angels lace front wigsâ€¦ hair greaseâ€¦ wave cap, brushâ€¦ cocoa butter.â€
â€œAll of my angels have natural hair. Thanks anyway, Kum Fuk Mi Sun. Next man, who is it?â€
â€œItâ€™s a white man.â€
â€œLet him in.â€
[dramatic piano playing]
[rock music playing]
[yelling] â€œI waited in that line for 15 fuckinâ€™ minutes! I shouldâ€™ve been first, you know. Is there a Starbucks up here anywhere?â€
â€œNext man, who is it?â€
[music stops suddenly]
[piano melody resumes]
â€œItâ€™s a black man.â€
â€œLet him in. Let him in. I said, let him in.â€
â€œGod.â€
â€œWhat?â€
â€œHeâ€™s late. He said heâ€™ll be here in 10, 15, 20, 30 minutes. Oh, look, God! Heâ€™s here.â€
[piano stops suddenly]
[funk music playing]
â€œOh, Jesus, Lord. I couldnâ€™t wait to see you! [exclaiming] Let me get a picture with you, baby. Yeah, Iâ€™m fittinâ€™ to post this right now. Look, God, listen. I know Iâ€™ve been late on my child support. That weed I was selling is legal. Can you help a n*gga get his car fixed?â€
[music stops suddenly]
I fucked the joke up.
Hit the black music again.
[funk music resumes]
â€œOh, Lord, Jesus! Oh, n*gga! Oh, Iâ€™ll tell you, Godâ€¦ Oh, man. Look, check this out. Look, I know Iâ€™ve been late on my child support. That weed that Iâ€™m selling is legal. You remember I got shot on Figueroa? And you brought me back to life? I appreciate all of that.
[music fading]
God, listen to me, man. I know I ainâ€™t been right out there in them streets. But I had to do what I had to do to take care of my familyâ€¦ you know. And I know you know that Iâ€™m a realâ€¦ Iâ€™m a real n*gga, you know.
[audience laughing]
I believed in you more than any of these n*ggas around here. I stayed praying to you. Can you help a n*gga get his car out the shop?â€
Thank yâ€™all. Thank you so much! Thank yâ€™all! Iâ€™m Mike Epps. I love yâ€™all! LA!

â™ª And away I pranced â™ª
â™ª It was a flirty thing Iâ€™d seen some of the skinny hot girls do â™ª
â™ª But Andrew was just like â™ª
â€œGimme my hat back.â€
â™ª I cried the whole way home â™ª
â™ª I thought Stealing someoneâ€™s hat was sexy â™ª
â™ª But now I sing in dimly lit bars â™ª
â™ª Andrew voted for Trump and has a car â™ª
I donâ€™t have one.
â™ª Boys never wanted to kiss me â™ª

[cheering and applause]
Give it up for Henry Koperski on the keys.
[audience cheers]
So, welcome to heaven. This my show. [laughs] You look at me, you think, â€œOkay. She has it all.â€ And itâ€™s true. I do. Ooh. Iâ€™m young. Oh. Iâ€™m gorgeous. Ooh. But, just this morning, I had one sip of cold brew and ruined my only butthole.
[laughter]
Stars, theyâ€™re just like us. I am so happy to be doing this in New York City.
[cheering]
Mmm! New York City, where I, for lack of a better term, do actually â€œlive.â€
The other day, I was dry-swallowing my birth control pill as I Citi Biked up the Williamsburg Bridge and I was like, â€œOh, my God. I guess I am the voice of my generation.â€ And itâ€™s exhausting, but someone has to do it. [burps] Iâ€™m sorryâ€¦
[audience laughs]
Oh, Iâ€™m sorry. I literally canâ€™t stop creating content. If this gets too tall, I will try to fuck it. So we have toâ€¦ She has a type.
I recently quit my job because I couldnâ€™t wake up and go there. Does that resonate with anyone?
Yeah.
So, now Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of lying on my bed, just kind of waiting for the retweet, thatâ€™ll [clicks tongue] turn it all around.
Social media is perfect, â€™cause you can watch people you barely know sort of unravel in real time. Which I absolutely foot pop jâ€™adore. No, jealousy is cool, â€™cause itâ€™s like swallowing a house that you just set on fire.
[audience laughs]
Not to be this bitch, but a pandemic, colon? Not what I had in mind. So ranâ€¦ Literally, so random. I was like, â€œI did not know this was an option.â€ I was way more concerned with things just falling on my head. Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff thatâ€™s up. And here I am beneath. But a pandemic is what we ultimately got. Which was rock and roll, normal and cool.
The last year was absolutely exquisite. I gained a lot of weight over the last year, which isnâ€™t good or bad. It isnâ€™t good or bad. Notâ€¦ It isnâ€™t good or bad. So, it isnâ€™t good or bad to gain weight because isnâ€™t good or bad.
And can you tell I had therapy two times this week?
Yes.
Oh, my God. A standing ovation so early in the show. I did not see that coming. Um, but itâ€™s cool.
One perk of gaining weight is that, obviously, my tits got huge. If you didnâ€™t notice, itâ€™s because you hate women. My tits got big enough that I can now, like all the great poets who came before me, titty fuck my boyfriend.
[audience cheers]
Thank you. Thank you. No, no. And thatâ€™s not why I do it.
I donâ€™t like being the girl whoâ€™s like, [whining] â€œMy boyfriend, my boyfriend,â€ I feel like girls who are like, [whining] â€œMy boyfriend, my boyfriend,â€ are the same kind of girls who are like, [in nasal voice] â€œThere is actually too much sugar in fruit.â€ [in normal voice] â€œSo, for me, itâ€™s a dessert.â€
And then their mouth goes all the way around their face. But I can officially titty fuck myâ€¦ Donâ€™t you sometimes wish there were different words for things? But now my tits are big enough that I can wrap â€™em â€™round my boyfriendâ€™s cock.
Did you thinkâ€¦ Be honest. Did you think youâ€™d hear â€œcockâ€ this early in the show? Cock is such a porny word.
I famously love porn, if my boyfriend tells me the girl looks like me. Otherwise, it is bad for women. And thatâ€™s just where I stand on that issue.
So, I was, for the last time, titty fucking my boyfriend. Humble brag. Andâ€¦ when he cameâ€¦ [clicks tongue] Yeah. Could hear a freaking pin drop. When he came, [smacks lips] he made a sound Iâ€™ve never heard before. And I was like, â€œ[chuckles] Okay. Iâ€™m a sex goddess.â€ I turn to him, I sayâ€¦
[clicks tongue]
â€œHow was that for you?â€
And he goes, â€œIt was actually almost painful.â€
Um, feminist win much?
Yes. Iâ€™m doing the work.
Oh, thereâ€™s such a good energy in here. Iâ€¦ Youâ€™re family.
[audience cheers]
I love. I love.
What a summer. Itâ€™s been a time. I hate the summer. All Iâ€™ve ever done in a bikini is sob.
But one thing I love about summer, I have to say, is those hot, hot summer anthems. So, if the DJ could just drop that track real quick, thatâ€™d be sick.
Iâ€™m really more of a dancer than a comedian. Dancer first, choreographer second, model third, comedian fourth.
[audience whooping]
Shh. Let me do my thing.

â™ª But I got something I must share So, listen up, hey, hey â™ª

[cheering]
Um, I think everyone has heard by now, but I want to be up front about this. I have some exciting news. Iâ€¦ [chuckles] recently read a book.
[scattered laughter]
[cheering]
Thank you. [mouthing] Thank you. I love you. I have a rare disease where if I read a book, the whole time Iâ€™m looking at it, Iâ€™m like, [chuckles] â€œLook at you. Reading a book.â€ â€œYou stupid, stupid slut.â€ Just â€™cause I donâ€™t like to read, write, argue or be alone, doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not an intellectual.
[cheering]
Thatâ€™s my crowd work.
I actually won a very prestigious award lately. Hold for applause. I won an award for leaving my home without my phone for 42 minutes.
Yeah. Thank you.
And, no, and thatâ€™s not why I do it. And thatâ€™s not why I do it. When I did that, I had what critics and fans alike are calling â€œa lady in a movie moment.â€
â€œWhatâ€™s that? Whatâ€™s that? What could that possibly be? What is that?â€
So, â€œa lady in a movie momentâ€ is when something happens to you that might happen to a lady in a movie.
So, for example, if you, umâ€¦ if you check the mail with your little keyâ€¦
Lady in a movie.
[laughter]
If you hold a baguetteâ€¦ If youâ€™re even near a baguetteâ€¦
Lady in a movie.
And if you, say it with me, run into your ex on the street, that is full-blown, hundy p, lady in aâ€¦
[audience] Lady in a movie.
Thank you.
Oh!
It feels good to be at home.
So, I did recently, like a cartoon, have a lady in a movie moment.
I ran into my ex on the street. [scoffs]
And he was wearing a suit.
He looked incredible. Which is, as we know, illegal.
And I was wearingâ€¦
Whatâ€™s it called when you, like, donâ€™t shave your legs for three months and then you shave â€™em really quick and thereâ€™s blood everywhere?
[audience laughs]
So, I was wearing that. And we ran into each other, and heâ€™s one of these people who uses your name in a sentence. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Whoa. [chuckles] If you use my name in a sentence, you need to either fuck me or kill me. Thereâ€™s no in-between.
On this occasion, he kind of chose to do neither, which was, of course, a power move and not at all related to how he feels about me.
Iâ€™m sorry. I just choked on my own human tongue.
Breakups are cool. Right? Iâ€™m a guyâ€™s girl. Breakups are cool. Breakups are freaking sick. Breakups are cool because itâ€™s like you have a best friend and then they die.
[audience laughs]
And then, instead of going to their funeral, you go and fuck a long-haired guy named Randy in the back seat of a red Mazda in the parking lot of a water park.
And when you ask him to drive you home, he goes, â€œI canâ€™t. Iâ€™m on shrooms.â€
What stage of grief is that?
Which one? No. Okay, thatâ€™s good.
Get back to me on that. Iâ€¦ I learned a lot from my ex, though. Itâ€™s cool.
I never thought, and Iâ€™m sorry, I get choked up when I talk about this.
But, I, umâ€¦ [exhales]
Here I go again. He knows.
I never thought [sighs] that I could love someone who can watch an entire movie while sitting upright in a wooden chair.
But love works in mysterious ways.
I mean, she really, really does.
My ex and I lived together for three years.
And we actually kept living together two months after we broke up.
Which is, of course, say it with me, good for the environment.
Oops, I just ran for office.
Oops, I just won.
[audience laughs]
Thankfullyâ€¦ [chuckles] Imagine.
[audience laughs]
No, thank you.
[vocalizing whooshing] Umâ€¦
Wheneverâ€¦ Whenever I thinkâ€¦ Iâ€™m like, â€œWho decides where the streets go?â€
I think about that a lot.
And all I think is, â€œI am so glad thatâ€™s not my job.â€
So, thankfully, I live by myself now.
When I first moved into my own apartment, I fully developed a, say it with me, new personality.
I have a lot of new traits now.
I recently went to a Chipotle at 10:45 a.m.
Doctorâ€™s orders.
And when I walked in, I was likeâ€¦
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m cool. When I walk into Chipotleâ€¦
Up here, Iâ€™m allâ€¦ At Chipotle, I get it.
Iâ€™m likeâ€¦
[audience laughing]
[smacks lips]
I walk into a Chipotle and the guy working thereâ€¦
Yes, a man. Important for the story.
Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat do you want?â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay. He wants to have raw dog sex with me.â€
No. I say, â€œHello. I would like a chicken burrito bowl.â€
â€œI know guac is extra and Iâ€™ll take the hottest sauce.â€
He goes, â€œ[scoffs] You sure?â€
[moans]
I was like, â€œOh, my God.â€
[in young girl voice] â€œAm I sure?â€
Mmmâ€¦
â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
â€œI never thought about that before.â€
[smacks lips]
â€œI donâ€™t think about big boy questions like that.â€
â€œIâ€™m just a little girly.â€
â€œI think about little girly things like earrings.â€
â€œAnd shoes. I donâ€™t know about big boy stuff like that.â€
â€œIâ€™m just a little baby with titties.â€
[in normal voice] Oh, Iâ€™m sorry. I just completely blacked out.
Did I do something?
Wait, did I say something annoying?
I donâ€™t think we should kill all the men.
Hold for applause.
But I donâ€™t think men should be allowed to make movies.
[audience member whoops]
Superhero movies are so boring I could melt into the Earth.
I donâ€™t care about movies that are about, like, sandâ€¦ or rope, or space.
The only kind of movies I want to watch are where a woman looks at herself in her medicine cabinet mirror and saysâ€¦
[in deep voice] â€œHello, stranger.â€
[in normal voice] Thatâ€™s kind of the genre that works for me.
That being said, I do wanna be the first person in a Marvel movie whoâ€™s never seen a Marvel movie.
So, DM me.
You know, itâ€™s sad.
I do have a hard time with men, but even Iâ€¦ Even I canâ€™t resist. Even I get a bit horny thisâ€¦
[audience whooping]
â€¦time of year.
â™ª Love is in the air tonight â™ª
â™ª Those summer lights Are twinkling bright â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m sitting here Sipping an iced coffee â™ª
â™ª I wonâ€™t feel bad for being A little bit naughty â™ª
[audience laughs]
â™ª Iâ€™ll eat a cookie or two â™ª
â™ª Itâ€™s just that time of year â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ll stay out later than I should â™ª
â™ª Might have a glass of wine On a school night â™ª
â™ª Baby, itâ€™s just that time of year â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ll take the scenic route home â™ª
â™ª Itâ€™s just that time of year â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ll dig a really deep hole â™ª
â™ª Itâ€™s just that time of year â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ll keep digging that hole Till thereâ€™s a very deep hole â™ª
â™ª Baby, itâ€™s just that time of year â™ª
[exclaims]
â™ª When I drag you in the hole â™ª
â™ª Babe, you wonâ€™t feel a thing â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ve knocked you out with a shovel â™ª
â™ª When you wake up in that hole Wonderinâ€™ how you got so low â™ª
â™ª Know itâ€™s â€™cause you touched My lower back at a party four years ago â™ª
â™ª And then you made That joke about raping me â™ª
â™ª And when I see your friends â€˜Cause itâ€™s that time of year â™ª
â™ª When the boysâ€™ll close down the bar â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ll let them know with my eyes â™ª
â™ª There will be no surprise â™ª
â™ª If you touch me I will destroy your life â™ª
â™ª And when you slowly die â™ª
â™ª â€˜Cause itâ€™s that time of year â™ª
â™ª When the nights They get, oh, so cold â™ª
Brr.
â™ª Youâ€™ll wish you were safe at home â™ª
â™ª Drinking with your bros â™ª
â™ª But instead youâ€™re dying in a hole â™ª
â™ª â€˜Cause you treated me Like I was your property â™ª
â™ª And ever since then Youâ€™ve been dead to me â™ª
â™ª And the last thing you see Will be my face â™ª
Good night.
[audience applauding, cheering]
Ooh.
Okay. I feel so randomly safe with yâ€™all. So comfortable.
Family, family, family.
I can reveal now, at this point in the programâ€¦
[laughs]
In high school, my nickname was Critter.
I think â€™cause Iâ€™m conventionally attractive andâ€¦
[audience laughs]
I didnâ€™t love it because Critter was shortened to â€œCrit.â€
To me, that sounded a lot like â€œClit.â€
And I was like, â€œWhatâ€™s happening with my one life?â€ Butâ€¦
Honestly, now, like, I am a lot like a clit. Iâ€™m extremely sensitive, I love to be touched, and straight guys just donâ€™t know what to do with me. Sometimes they want to fuck me, and sometimes they think Iâ€™m like a fun aunt â€™cause my energy is likeâ€¦
[hums]
And Iâ€™m always at restaurants moaning along when the waiter tells me the specials. Iâ€™m always like, â€œMmm, risotto.â€
Mmm. â€˜Cause itâ€™s always a mushroom risotto. Fuck yes!
[audience] Whoo!
Wow!
That mushroom risotto joke is an absolute banger.
Umâ€¦ Thank you so much. Have a great night. No.
You wish. You sick fucks.
But I got more to give.
I actually was supposed to go to my ten-year high school reunion recently.
But I couldnâ€™t go because I was, um, jerking off on the floor of my apartment.
â€œWhy the floor? Why the floor? Why the floor?â€
I was too lazy to close the window curtain that looks into the bed.
So, I was like, â€œFloor it is.â€
And I think everyone here knows, but I do actually have a mirrored armoire in my bedroom.
If you donâ€™t know what an armoire is, now would be an awesome time to leave the show.
[audience laughs]
Thank you.
Bye.
So Iâ€™m jerking off on the floor.
And the way I do it is beached-whale style, which means I just lay on my hand and [trills] away.
And when I looked up into my mirrored armoire, I saw something I really wouldnâ€™t wish on anyone.
I sawâ€¦ [chuckles] in its organic, hardy, grass-fed, natural stateâ€¦ my O face.
Without the performance of sex, the pressure of another, I saw what I looked like when I cum, which isâ€¦
[audience laughing]
So, when I cum, this is actually my O face.
I donâ€™t want to be like this.
By the way, if my face was symmetrical, I would not be up here doing this shit.
Goes without saying, I donâ€™t want to be this way.
I want to be the kind of girl who just wears jeans.
I wish I could doâ€¦ You know when people do that?
I canâ€™t jump even a little.
This is literally me jumping as high as I can.
I wish I could be the kind of girl whoâ€™s likeâ€¦
Sometimes peopleâ€™s legs go up.
I want to be the kind of girl who just doesnâ€™t like the taste of beer.
The kind of girl who can save half a sandwich for later.
The kind of girl who can go into a coffee shop and just stare at sheet music.
[sighs]
Just clutch it and stare at it and be like, â€œI get this.â€
[audience laughs]
I want to be the kind of woman whoâ€™s out to lunch with friends, sheâ€™s draped in silks, draped in silks, draped in silks.
The restaurant, of course, white tablecloth, white tablecloth.
And she starts to laugh because she remembers something funny, a memory maybe.
But before she does, she stops herself.
She saysâ€¦
[laughing]
â€œI was in love once.â€
So thatâ€™s the kind of girl I want to be.
But I have career goals too.
[woman] Whoo!
Girl boss.
Um, I really, reallyâ€¦ And this is serious.
This is off the record. I really want to wear a bonnet on screen.
Does anyone have one?
I have such a face for hats.
I have the worldâ€™s roundest face. Thank you.
No. Donâ€™t all stand up at once.
I really want to wear a bonnet on screen. Umâ€¦
And then my second career goal is I want to be in a film where Iâ€™m going on a first date, and as Iâ€™m kissing my suitor goodnight, I close the door shut to my apartment, and then I turn around and I justâ€¦
Yes. I slide against that door.
I hooked up with a guy I met on a first date once â€™cause Iâ€™m a slut.
Take back the word.
And mid-moment, he was like, â€œOh, yeah. I love that fat, fat ass.â€
And I was likeâ€¦ â€œMaybe one fat was enough.â€
[audience laughs]
I do. I do. Iâ€¦ I know.
I gravely want to be thin because of society.
[playing piano]
Because thin privilege is real.
If youâ€™re thinâ€¦ This is my ideal body type.
If youâ€™re thin, you can be famous for smoking a cigarette and looking sad.
If youâ€™re fat and thereâ€™s a photo of you smoking a cigarette and looking sad, itâ€™s a campaign for something.
Itâ€™s some D.A.R.E. shit. You know what I mean?
[chuckles]
But mostly I want to be thin so I can wear whatever clothes I want, whenever I want.
Because, as we all know, womenâ€™s clothing sizes are totally fucked.
And thatâ€™s what this songâ€™s about.
â™ª Donâ€™t understand Why yâ€™all wonâ€™t make bigger clothes â™ª
â™ª I want the styles that youâ€™re making A size zero â™ª
â™ª Donâ€™t understand why Yâ€™all wonâ€™t just listen to me â™ª
â™ª You dumbass bitch I am just trying to give you my money â™ª
â™ª Take my money, take, take my money Make it easy on me â™ª
â™ª Take my money, take, take my money Just make a size 14, okay â™ª
â™ª Take my money, take, take my money A lot of fat people have money â™ª
â™ª So, take my money, please â™ª
â™ª Canâ€™t figure out how many hours I have logged â™ª
â™ª Sobbing in dressing rooms And fighting with my mom â™ª
â™ª I donâ€™t have time to grab Thirteen pairs of jeans â™ª
â™ª Jeans are a myth They are a fraud â™ª
â™ª They are not relaxing â™ª
â™ª Tell me, have you ever felt at ease In a pair of jeans? â™ª
â™ª They are so stiff Theyâ€™re an invention of the patriarchy â™ª
â™ª I know in the â€™50s it was empowering To be like, â€œWeâ€™re wearing menâ€™s pantsâ€ â™ª
â™ª But now they make womenâ€™s jeans so tight I canâ€™t sit upright â™ª
â™ª Donâ€™t get me started On boyfriend jeans â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ve never been Thinner than any man that I have dated â™ª
â™ª I like a skeleton man It must be a subconscious thing â™ª
â™ª Like if I fuck this skinny guy I wonâ€™t have a chubby daughter â™ª
â™ª That Iâ€™ll have to fight with In the dressing room â™ª
â™ª Shout out to Urban Outfitters I mostly cry at Urban Outfitters â™ª
â™ª Why do they make All their clothes so tiny? â™ª
â™ª I love their stuff â™ª
â™ª I really, really love their stuff â™ª
â™ª And I wish they would make it bigger Now make it bigger so I could wear it â™ª
â™ª Take my money, take, take my money Make it easy on me â™ª
â™ª Take my money, take, take my money Just make a size 14, okay â™ª
â™ª Take my money, take, take my money â™ª
[scatting] â™ª Money â™ª
â™ª So take my money please â™ª
Bridge!
â™ª Tell me, have you ever seen An old painting? â™ª
â™ª The skinny girlâ€™s milking a cow The fat girl is just laying â™ª
â™ª Because, before, the richer the person The bigger they are â™ª
â™ª But even today, donâ€™t you know Fat people still have credit cards â™ª
â™ª Take my money, make it easy on me â™ª
â™ª Take my money, take my money Make a size 14 â™ª
Mosh pit me.
â™ª Take my money, take â™ª
Mosh me.
â™ª Take my money â™ª
Mosh me.
â™ª Take my money please â™ª
Mosh pit me.
â™ª Because when I was younger I was traumatized trying to find jeans â™ª
â™ª That were the right size â™ª
â™ª If they fit around my waist They were way too long â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™d have to call my mom Have her bring me along to the tailor â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™d say cut â€™em off Make â€™em short enough for me â™ª
â™ª Sheâ€™d go, â€œNo, no, no. Just roll â€™em up What if you grow?â€ â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™d say, â€œI donâ€™t want to know What happens if I growâ€ â™ª
â™ª â€˜Cause if I wear my jeans like that All the girls at school will go â™ª
â™ª â€œWhy are your jeans rolled up You fat, fucking stupid bitch?â€ â™ª
They wonâ€™t say that, but theyâ€™ll mean that.
You know what I mean?
â™ª And now whenever I see A little girl on the street â™ª
â™ª I want to cry â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, my God You have no idea how bad it getsâ€ â™ª
â™ª So, I put that shit out of my head â™ª
â™ª But sometimes Iâ€™ll be walking On the street in New York City â™ª
Iâ€™ll see a person. Iâ€™ll say, â€œOh, my God. Is that person okay?â€
â€œIs that person okay?â€
â€œThat personâ€™s so small.â€
My friend will turn to me and say, â€œThatâ€™s a kid. Thatâ€™s all.â€
â€œThatâ€™s a kid. A lot of people have them.â€
And if you thought about something other than yourself
â™ª For five fucking seconds Maybe youâ€™d know that â™ª
â™ª That you could Have a whole entire life â™ª
â™ª If you just stopped Constantly thinking about your size â™ª
â™ª But I said, â€œSociety made me this way And Iâ€™ll never changeâ€ â™ª
â™ª â€˜Cause Iâ€™m tired â™ª
â™ª Society made me this way And I donâ€™t want to change â™ª
â™ª â€˜Cause itâ€™s hard to change Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned â™ª
â™ª So Iâ€™ll blame my problems On someone else â™ª
â™ª Which is cool and healthy And really good to do â™ª
â™ª So take my money, wonâ€™t you? â™ª
[applause and cheering]
[Catherine laughs]
Whenever I tell people I want to lose weight, theyâ€™re like, â€œYou should go to the gym.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI know.â€
For sure. [chuckles]
But whenever I go to the gym and I see people with abs, itâ€™s like, â€œWhy are you still here?â€
â€œYou did it.â€
Like, â€œGet a hobbyâ€¦ for once.â€
I donâ€™t know.
I justâ€¦ I know working out is good for mental health.
I do suffer from depression, or as I like to call it, â€œCrying because outside smells like the past.â€
I love nostalgia. It hurts and feels bad.
Boop.
But when I go to the gym, I just cannot connect with those people.
If youâ€™re someone who uses and cleans a blender every day, itâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s really going on?â€
[audience laughs]
Whatâ€™s going on?
[playing piano]
If youâ€™re someone who signs up for, like, â€œmud fuck run.â€
Or itâ€™s like, â€œWe run for a month.â€
â€œAnd you never come home.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œWhat is that?â€
I just worry about you.
And soâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna sing this song for you.
â™ª I see you on the West Side Highway â™ª
â™ª In your Lululemons â™ª
â™ª Itâ€™s harrowing That you were born in 1997 â™ª
â™ª It seems to me like You really have it all going on â™ª
â™ª So whyâ€™d you post on Facebook That youâ€™re running a marathon? â™ª
â™ª Why do you think we all want to know? â™ª
Oh.
â™ª What are you running from? What are you running from? â™ª
â™ª What are you running from? â™ª
â™ª Running a marathon Is clinically insane â™ª
â™ª What are you running from? â™ª [smacks lips]
â™ª What are you running from? â™ª
â™ª Have you tried just telling your friend That youâ€™re sad instead? â™ª
â™ª I like a gentle jog too, yeah It helps to shake things loose â™ª
â™ª When I jog I feel like I could Almost shit like Iâ€™m a normal girl â™ª
â™ª But when you tell me That youâ€™re running 26.2 â™ª
â™ª It makes me think that youâ€™re burying Years of inherited trauma â™ª
â™ª Why do you think we all want to know? â™ª
â™ª Oh â™ª
â™ª What are you running from? What are you running from? â™ª
â™ª What are you running from? â™ª
â™ª Running a marathon Is clinically insane â™ª
â™ª What are you running from, seriously? â™ª

â™ª Have you tried just breaking up With that finance guy instead? â™ª
â™ª I like a finance dude, too, yes â™ª
â™ª Slept with one or two, too â™ª
â™ª One time I fucked one who had a jersey With his own name on it on his wall â™ª
â™ª And when I turned around He took the condom off â™ª
â™ª And when I turned back around I was like, â€œWait, what?â€ â™ª
â™ª And he was like, â€œWait, what?â€ â™ª
â™ª And I was like, â€œI saw what you didâ€ â™ª
â™ª And then he called me a bitch â™ª
â™ª I was like, â€œI need money for the morning after pillâ€ â™ª
â™ª And he threw forty dollars cash at me â™ª
â™ª And that was actually the first weekend I ever lived in New York City â™ª
â™ª What are you runningâ€¦ What are you running from? â™ª
â™ª Running a marathon is clinically insane What could you be running from? â™ª
â™ª What could you Possibly be running from? â™ª
â™ª Have you tried Just going for a little walk? â™ª
â™ª Or eating one of the little Boozy milkshakes? â™ª
â™ª Double the fun Why donâ€™t you go to one of those places â™ª
â™ª Where they scrape Parmesan cheese Out of the big wheel? â™ª
â™ª Put that online, baby Oh, yeah, fill the void â™ª
[cheering and applause]
At this point in the show, I know youâ€™re thinking, â€œOkay. So, sheâ€™s beautiful and talented.â€
â€œThereâ€™s no way that thereâ€™s anything up here.â€
But Iâ€™m actually a brilliant poet and writer.
And so Iâ€™m gonna share some of my poetry.
Uh, could you give us a little mood music? I think that would be good.
[plays piano]
Oh, my God. Wow.
[audience laughs]
Takes me back.
[laughs]
Sorry. I just thought of something, but itâ€™s for a different show.
[audience laughs]
Hmm.
[sighs]
â€œA poem I wrote last night when I couldnâ€™t go to sleep, because there are no sheets on my bed because I perioded on my other sheets and cannot be bothered to put new ones on.â€
â€œIâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t text you back about borrowing my adult sized tutu for your sketch comedy show.â€
â€œI was on the L train trying to recall how I knew the guy sitting across from me.â€
â€œTurns out it was from sex. Thank you so much.â€
So this next poemâ€¦
[audience laughs]
This is called â€œPoem I wrote after my therapist got mad at me for thinking everyoneâ€™s mad at me.â€
â€œI just found out â€˜dogâ€™ isnâ€™t short for something.â€
â€œItâ€™s actually just called a dog, which is fine with me.â€
â€œIâ€™m in the kitchen, alone. Which is romantic in a way.â€
â€œAnything can be romantic if you sigh a lot.â€
â€œOne time, I told this guy I loved him.â€ He said, â€œI donâ€™t know what love is.â€
â€œAnyway, he just got engaged.â€ Thank you.
[audience laughs]
â€œPoem I wrote after I masturbated while wearing AirPods.â€
It could happen to you, so be vigilant.
â€œSometimes, being an adult means washing your hair.â€
â€œSometimes, the only way to know if a guy is definitely straight is if he Instagrams a building.â€
â€œSometimes I feel like if I look at my phone, I will die or worse, not die.â€
â€œItâ€™s insane when you ask someone to give you space and then they do.â€
Thank you.
This next poem is called â€œA poem I wrote after you told me your ex is â€˜actually really cool.'â€
â€œA guy on the street said I looked like I was studying audio engineering in school.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œHe told me he liked my outfit. He told me to have a â€˜cool day.'â€
â€œIâ€™m googling how long a stroke lasts.â€
Thank you.
â€œPoem I wrote after you went down on me and then called me â€˜dude.'â€
[audience laughs]
â€œI have a disease where I never want to get out of the Uber.â€
â€œBecause then it means I have to be somewhere.â€
â€œFor years Iâ€™ve been suffering from a serious addiction to Adam Driver and Jason Schwartzman, even.â€
â€œMaybe my crush hasnâ€™t texted because Iâ€™m out of town.â€
â€œBut then again, I never told him I was going out of town.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œIâ€™m always horny and looking for somewhere to charge my phone.â€
â€œThe Paris Review came in the mail today and I performed reading it.â€
â€œI canâ€™t write if no one is watching.â€
â€œI canâ€™t stop checking my pussy for weird bumps.â€
â€œOne time I went to the doctor and when she told me I gained fifteen pounds, I was like, â€˜Thatâ€™s a lot.â€™ And she was just like, â€˜Yeah.'â€
Thank you.
[applause and cheering]
I love sex because it famously has no consequences.
[audience laughs]
I was recently at the Newark Airport. Brag.
And I saw a headline on a magazine. Vintage.
And it read, â€œCouple fucks themselves off side of cliff.â€
Where were you?
When you found out?
How you were going to die?
Because for me, I was like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s an option.â€
[audience laughs]
I love fuck.
I have some sexual fantasies I want to share with you all.
My first sexual fantasy is that Iâ€™m in a mahogany room.
Built-in bookcases. Built-in bookcases. Built-in bookcases.
And Iâ€™m sitting in a velvet wingback chair.
And I put my ring finger to my temple and I just say, â€œUgh. I worry. I do.â€
[audience laughs]
And then my other sexual fantasy is that he makes me cum, damn it.
Am I right, ladies? Is that a lot to ask? Honey, Iâ€™m looking for a guy tall enough that I donâ€™t have to get on my knees when I want to blow him.
Thatâ€™s right. I want to stand up, dick should be here.
[audience laughs]
I hooked up withâ€¦
[chuckles]
I hooked up with this guy I met at a bar because Iâ€™m brave, and he was like, â€œI actually biked to this bar. I can bike us back to my place.â€
â€œYou can ride on my pegs.â€
And I was like, [in British accent] â€œAbsolutely not.â€
[smacks lips]
[audience laughs]
[in normal voice] He was like, â€œNo. itâ€™s okay. It can hold 120 pounds.â€
And I was like, â€œOkay, you donâ€™t know what math is. You are my type.â€
[audience laughs]
I just feel like itâ€™s like every chubby girlâ€™s nightmare to be carried in a playful way.
Like, Iâ€™m pretty sure when I was born, the nurse, like, picked me up and handed me to my mom, and I was like, â€œItâ€™s okay. You can put me down.â€
[audience laughs]
Itâ€™s sad.
After I slept with him, I woke up with a, say it with me, bump on my pussy.
Just lucky, I guess. Foot pop, jâ€™adore.
And I was like, â€œGreat. I need to reach out to my gynecologist about this.â€
So, I had to access her through, say it with me, The Portal.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™m sâ€¦
Why are doctors absolutely, clinically addicted to making you enter through a portal? Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ â€œIâ€™m here.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œCan I just get an email orâ€¦â€ They want you to be likeâ€¦
[audience laughs]
They want you to be full Narnia vibes to talk to them about your broken pussy. A portal? Oh, my God. What year is it?
Okay. I donâ€™tâ€¦ I hate sci-fi.
Thereâ€™s enoughâ€¦ Thereâ€™s enough stuff hereâ€¦ thatâ€™s really interesting.
We donâ€™t have toâ€¦ We donâ€™t have toâ€¦ I donâ€™t need anything with wings.
Bitch, I have â€™em.
Oh, my God. So, I was like, â€œI need to take a picture of this to send to my gynecologist.â€
So, I went into my studio, which is obviously an empty room with a full-size mattress on the floor.
And I took out my camera, which is obviously an iPhone rose gold Plus with a cracked screen, â€™cause Iâ€™m fun.
Spread my lips and I took an image.
I wish that were the end of the story.
Iâ€™m going to do a lap.
When I looked at that image, umâ€¦
Are you okay to hear this?
Ally.
[audience laughs]
Feminist ally. When I looked at the image, it was one of the most harrowing things Iâ€™ve ever seen.
One, I used flash. Rookie mistake.
Two, I didnâ€™t understand the reach of my camera.
So, when I looked at the picture, I didnâ€™t only see my spread pussy lips, which I expected.
But, in the background, I saw what can only be described as my dead-eyed face.
[audience laughs]
No expression. Just a corpseâ€™s head, really.
So, I had to crop that out for legal reasons.
And when I sent it to my gyne, she was like, â€œThereâ€™s nothing wrong with you.â€
I know thereâ€™s a long history of doctors not believing women, but in my case, doctors shouldnâ€™t believe me because
Iâ€™m what many medical professionals have called a dumbass bitch. Thank you to my fans.
[audience laughs]
But it was stressful. Oh, my God.
And the thing about stress is that when youâ€™re stressed in New York City, thereâ€™s only one place to go.
[playing piano]
â™ª Upstate, Upstate Maybe everything will change â™ª
â™ª Upstate, Upstate If I go for two days â™ª
[audience laughs]
â™ª Upstate, Upstate Think of the Instagrams Iâ€™ll take â™ª
â™ª Think of the four pages Of a novel Iâ€™ll read â™ª
â™ª Think of all the trees â™ª
Oh!
Ooh, look at all the trees, Iâ€™m worldbuilding.
Look at all those trees.
Wow.
â™ª I do think trees are medicinal â™ª
â™ª The Japanese have this principle Called a â€œforest bathâ€ â™ª
â™ª The idea being that â™ª
â™ª Youâ€™re cleansed By walking through nature â™ª
â™ª But instead I live in New York City â™ª
â™ª Which is an amusement park from hell â™ª
â™ª If youâ€™re an adult who likes Disney Wellâ€¦ â™ª
[mutters] â™ª Get help â™ª
â™ª Oh â™ª [chuckles]
â™ª Baby, please, ooh Itâ€™s just not my thing â™ª
â™ª Sorry, itâ€™s fucking creepy Ha-ha â™ª
â™ª Upstate, Upstate, ooh â™ª
â™ª I can draft tweets by a lake â™ª
â™ª Sipping coffee a bit farther â™ª
â™ª From where I normally sip coffee â™ª
â™ª This is how you make Your problems disappear â™ª
â™ª Ask anyone, the best way To make your problems go away â™ª
â™ª Is to go just three miles away From where you normally are â™ª
â™ª It always works I fucking love it â™ª
â™ª Upstate, Upstate, ooh â™ª
â™ª Thereâ€™s a diner Where you can eat a egg â™ª
â™ª Look outside the window At the changing of the seasons â™ª
â™ª So, fuck, why am I crying for no reason Fuck â™ª
â™ª Apples â™ª
â™ª Have you heard about apples? â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m going apple-picking With thirteen of my closest friends â™ª
â™ª And six of their sexual partners â™ª
â™ª Apples Well, maybe if I touch an apple â™ª
â™ª All my problems will fade And fall like autumnal foliage â™ª
â™ª You know, one time in college â™ª
â™ª I went apple-picking with a boyfriend â™ª
He was so tall.
â™ª He recently told me not to contact him â™ª
â™ª He has a new girlfriend now She wears high heels â™ª
â™ª And takes pictures of tortellini â™ª
â™ª I respect her, I laud her â™ª
â™ª I respect her She has good taste in men â™ª
â™ª Did I mention he was tall? â™ª
Help. Help. Spin. Fuck!
â™ª Instead of Upstate, I think â™ª
â™ª What I really need is to live in a box Where I canâ€™t touch my cell phone â™ª
â™ª Unless I stick my hand Through a trapdoor â™ª
â™ª That buzzes when I touch it â™ª
â™ª Fuck, Iâ€™ll develop, yes â™ª
â™ª A Pavlovian response To touching my cell phone â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ll be healed Isnâ€™t it funny? â™ª
â™ª And when I say â€œfunnyâ€ I mean deeply sad â™ª
â™ª That Iâ€™m addicted to my cell phone Cell phone â™ª
â™ª Does anyone still call it a cell phone? Itâ€™s really just a phone â™ª
â™ª Isnâ€™t that interesting? God, my work is so groundbreaking â™ª
â™ª Upstate, Upstate I might miss a call or respond late â™ª
â™ª If someone texts me, I might actually Have a reason not to respond right away â™ª
â™ª Upstate, Upstate â™ª
â™ª Think of all the friends Iâ€™ll fucking hate â™ª
â™ª After sharing a two-bedroom Airbnb Six or seven ways â™ª
â™ª Upstate Iâ€™ll wear flannel â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ll get a boyfriend So I can go to Beacon â™ª
â™ª Or Cold Spring If you have a boyfriend â™ª
â™ª Youâ€™re legally allowed To go to Beacon or Cold Spring â™ª
[applause and cheering]
[sighs]
Hide your boners, boys.
I have a hormone disorder in my ovaries.
Okay. Everyoneâ€™s rock-hard in the crowd.
I have polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS, or â€œPecosâ€ for cute. Boop, boop, boop.
[beeping playfully]
Everything online about womenâ€™s health is like, â€œWe donâ€™t know.â€
[audience laughs]
I get really bad migraines with visual auras.
Which means Iâ€™m inherently interesting.
And when you ask a doctor, â€œWhat are migraines?â€
Theyâ€™re all just likeâ€¦
So I have PCOS.
Let me tell you about PCOS.
Itâ€™s honestly iconic. Umâ€¦
The symptoms are one, youâ€™re fat. No, stop. Two, you are losing hair on your head, but, three, you have hair on your face, and four, you have acne.
So, itâ€™s sort of this, like, waking nightmare in which youâ€™re both young and old at the same time.
Itâ€™s like that optical illusion where the young womanâ€™s looking away and the old womanâ€™s looking down.
[audience laughs]
But in this case, itâ€™s just you looking at yourself in the mirror thinking, â€œMaybe God isnâ€™t a woman.â€
[audience laughs]
But if she is, I want to meet her.
Um, if I have to die, which Iâ€™m not super interested in, I know that, literally, on my death bed, Iâ€™ll be, like, surrounded by millions of loved ones.
And in my last dying breath Iâ€™ll be likeâ€¦
[gasping]
â€œDoes my hair look better [sniffs] half up or full down?â€
[audience laughs]
Those are a hundy p gonna be my last words.
How I really want to die is hosting a fabulous dinner party.
Twelve people. Yeah. My apartment in my fantasy you can have a table that thatâ€™s big.
Thatâ€™s thatâ€™s big.
Thatâ€™s that big.
Hard to say, easy to write.
Came to me like that.
[audience laughs]
Ooh.
Jâ€™adore. I canâ€™tâ€¦
I literally donâ€™t know a single word of French.
English, I can do.
Oh, my God. I once was studying abroad, â€™cause Iâ€™m so interesting.
And I was studying abroad and I was out clubbing with these, like, hot Italian guys.
And they were likeâ€¦ [laughs] They were like, â€œYour English is really good.â€
[audience laughs]
And I was like, â€œMm-hmm.â€
At first I was like, â€œItâ€™s the only language I speak.â€
But then I thought about it and I was like, â€œMy English is really good.â€
[audience laughs]
And whatâ€™s so bad about taking a compliment?
Especially as women. Especially in this industry.
We have to learn to stop apologizing and just say, â€œYeah. My English is really good.â€
[audience laughs]
So, how I want to die is Iâ€™m at this dinner party and everyoneâ€™s having their own bottle of wine, and thatâ€™s normal and fine and no one notices.
And then the person next to me goes, â€œOh, my God. I love that painting.â€
And I say, â€œOh, thank you. My friend painted that.â€
And then later in the evening, Iâ€™m lying in bed with my lover.
And he looks to me and he says, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?â€
And I say, â€œYou know, I justâ€¦â€
â€œI feel a kind of longing that resembles sadness only in the way that mist resembles rain.â€
And then I expire.
[audience laughs]
And heâ€™s like, â€œWas that a Wordsworth poem?â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œI think it was Longfellow. Canâ€™t remember.â€
From beyond.
From the beyond we argue about who wrote that line.
Um, goals.
I am in love right now, as insane as that sounds.
[audience whooping]
I know.
And the only way Iâ€™ll be single again is if he gets hit by a bus, which isâ€¦
For some reason, Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s such a common way to die.â€
Is it?
[audience laughs]
Okay. Now, Iâ€™m living in fearâ€¦ for the first time ever.
If I have to be single again, thatâ€™d be a disaster.
But in the meantime, I wrote this anthem for anyone out there who is single, who is looking for love, because I want love.
Because, well, I want everything.
[audience titters]
[piano music playing]
[mouthing]
[audience laughs]
â™ª Lately I feel like In that movie Love Actually â™ª
â™ª When Colin Firth sits at his desk â™ª
â™ª And says â€œWell, Iâ€™m alone again naturallyâ€ â™ª
â™ª I know Iâ€™m not Supposed to like that movie â™ª
â™ª I know itâ€™s problematic, says Buzzfeed â™ª
â™ª But romcoms have chemically altered The state of my brain â™ª
â™ª Anyways, the point is Iâ€™m single â™ª
â™ª And, hey Iâ€™m looking to, good rhyme, mingle â™ª
â™ª Yeah, Iâ€™m the horniest woman in America Havenâ€™t you heard? â™ª
â™ª I want to be objectified I know that isnâ€™t right â™ª
â™ª I know Iâ€™m not supposed To say things like that â™ª
â™ª Turn my feminism switch on But I want to be depraved â™ª
â™ª Yeah, I want to be Your fucking sex slave â™ª
â™ª Liz Phair said it best When she said â™ª
â™ª â€œI want to fuck you like a dogâ€ â™ª
â™ª I guess thatâ€™s romance to me â™ª
â™ª I think actually Thatâ€™s just what I need â™ª

â™ª Tell me why would I want Something that I already have â™ª
â™ª My therapist says Iâ€™m erotomanic So I googled that in a panic â™ª
I donâ€™t think she knows what it means.
She also told me I look like Jared Leto. Different story.
â™ª Anyways, erotomania Is a rare type of schizophrenia â™ª
â™ª Where you think Everyoneâ€™s in love with you â™ª
â™ª And thatâ€™s not really my thing â™ª
â™ª No, what I really like Is to have a $12 craft beer â™ª
â™ª And fight with the person Iâ€™m actively fucking â™ª
â™ª About whether or not theyâ€™re actually Sexually attracted to me â™ª
â™ª God, itâ€™s so fun to kind of Put salt in that wound, ah â™ª
â™ª Last week this guy asked me If I wanted to be his girlfriend â™ª
â™ª And then un-asked me four days later â™ª
â™ª Now every place we kissed Is on a special list â™ª
â™ª Of historic venues in New York City Because they are haunted, you see â™ª
â™ª The spell that his jawline cast on me â™ª
â™ª Is scarier than Any ghost Iâ€™ve ever seen â™ª
â™ª Oh, God, I donâ€™t want to die I really donâ€™t want to die â™ª
â™ª I donâ€™t believe Iâ€™m gonna die â™ª
â™ª I donâ€™t believe My parents will die either â™ª
â™ª When we talk about that, I say â™ª
â™ª â€œOkay If either one of you guys Decides to dieâ€ â™ª
â™ª â€œIâ€™ll just fucking kill myself, tooâ€ â™ª
â™ª They said, â€œHey, what would That really accomplish?â€ â™ª

Got a seat at theâ€¦ on theâ€¦ At the White House. Thatâ€™s some good shit right there. My man Amp Harris, man been throwing parties and helping the community forever.

[cheering]
â€˜Cause I know yâ€™all seen my new Netflix TV show, you know what I mean? Based out of Indianapolis. Monty was like, â€œYeah, I see you got you a new show with Tommy Davidson.â€ I said, â€œThatâ€™s Wanda Sykes.â€ Yeah, â€™cause these little young dudes, man. Theyâ€¦ Woof! Ooh. [Exhales] They need some help. Thatâ€™s what they need. Yeah. â€˜Cause these little kids are disrespectful nowadays. Little motherf*ckers. Like I said, the grandmas is different, you know what Iâ€™m saying? Yeah, the f*cking grandmas is different, man, shit. Remember, back in the day, them grandmas in our neighborhoodâ€¦ You catch eye contact with an old lady, she say, â€œGo to the store for me.â€ Oh shit. Now you gotta follow this old-ass lady in the house. House hot as hell. â€œLet me show you. It cost $1.89.â€ â€œCome here. Iâ€™m gonna show you what it is. Come on up here.â€ â€œReach up there and get that out of there right there.â€ â€œItâ€™s back there by the orange juice.â€ â€œAndâ€¦ and baby, get you something.â€ â€œGet you something.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna get me something. You might not get all your shit.â€ Thatâ€™s what I do to old ladies around. I take their money. Yeah, thatâ€™s some real shit, man. But I love telling jokes, know what I mean? I canâ€™t see myself doing anything else, you know? Yeah. These little young dudes around here, they are scary, you know. I was at a gas station the other day. Some young dudes was sitting in the car. I know they was talking â€™cause they was laughing. I was like, â€œWhat the f*ck is funâ€¦ â€œ. Soon as I walked back, â€™cause I have some braids. Motherf*cker was like, â€œTight braid head ass.â€ I was likeâ€¦ I heard it, but I was like, â€œF*ck them motherf*ckers.â€ I just went in the gas station. Man, I walk out, and I hear another motherf*cker, â€œBig short ass.â€ I said, â€œOh hell no.â€ I walk up to the car, I look down across, say, â€œLittle motherf*cker! Let me tellâ€¦â€. And when I look, they had a machine gun in the back seat. I said, â€œGod bless you, little brother. Yâ€™all have a good day. Take it easy.â€ Let me get the f*ck away from here, shit. That was a good thing Dave Chappelle did. But I wouldnâ€™t advise a motherf*cker that ainâ€™t got no money to do it. F*ck around and say something about the LGBTQTs. You better have some money. Say the wrong shit about them, them f*ckers be outside.
[chanting] â€œF*ck Mike Epps!â€ â€œF*ck Mike Epps!â€ â€œF*ck Mike Epps!â€
And mean it too. I tell men all the time, â€œHey, man.â€ â€œDonâ€™t be angry about gay people.â€ â€œâ€˜Cause if you too angry, it look like you hiding something.â€ They donâ€™t bother me, no. I see them all time. Iâ€™ll see â€™em at the airportâ€¦ â€œMike Epps!â€ I was like, â€œCalm down. First of all, calm down.â€ â€œStop making all the goddamn noise so everybody see us over here.â€ â€œI wanna take a picture with you.â€ I said, â€œIâ€™m taking a picture, man.â€ Iâ€™m looking around. I was like, â€œMan.â€ We finna take the picture. Everything cool. Something told me look down, so I looked. He taking a picture looking. I said, â€œNo, n*gga. We ainâ€™t taking that picture right there.â€ â€œWith your face looking at me, n*gga, we ainâ€™t doing that one.â€ He finna have me on Entertainment Tonight, n*gga.
[singing Entertainment Tonight theme]
I got married again, you know. I got a new wife, you know.
[audience cheering, whooping]
Hope I donâ€™t f*ck this one up, you know. [chuckles] Yeah, man, being married is a motherf*cker, man. Especially when youâ€™re in show business. â€˜Cause pussy just fall out the sky. Hey, hey! You gotta step over. â€œExcuse me, pussy. Iâ€™m gone.â€ â€œGonna f*ck my life up.â€ I love being Black, man. If I died and came back, I still wanna be a n*gga. Ainâ€™t that something?
[audience cheering loudly]
Look at the white people. â€œYou sure you wanna do that again?â€ You goddamn right. Itâ€™s hard being Black, but itâ€™s fair, â€™cause when you Black in America, shit, you know you start off on zero, you know what I mean? You donâ€™t never start off on ten, you know. You need people that started off on ten to help your zero ass. You know what I mean? So, yeah, itâ€™s hard being Black. Black people been through so motherf*cking much that white people, if you talk about them, theyâ€™ll just say, â€œI understand.â€ â€œGo ahead. Go right ahead.â€ â€œYou guys, itâ€™s unfair. Go right ahead.â€ â€œI understand.â€ [chuckles] Yeah, shit. African-American, shit, â€™cause everybody got somewhere to go but us. If the Mexican get mad, he can go back to Mexico. Ifâ€¦ ifâ€¦ Yeah. If the Asian get mad, he can go back to Asia. If we get mad, we ainâ€™t got no motherf*cking where to go. I thought it was Africa until I went. Motherf*cker was like,
[in African accent] â€œYou are not one of my real brothers.â€
[in normal voice] I was like, â€œWhat?â€
[in African accent] â€œYes, my brother. You are not one of my brothers.â€ â€œYou are very lazy.â€ â€œYou do not take advantage of your education.â€
[in normal voice] I said, â€œCan you drive this cab a little faster?â€ â€œAnd get some deodorant immediatelyâ€¦.â€ â€œWith your over-educated, underpaid ass.â€ Everybody think they going to heaven, and theyâ€™re not. God knows your crooked Christian ass. And if anybody ever left here before you and went to heaven, I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s your mama, your daddy, brother, sister, cousinâ€¦ They went so you could get in. â€˜Cause you wasnâ€™t getting in. You wasnâ€™t invited. Itâ€™s who you know. [chuckles] As soon as you get to heaven, man, the pearly gates are standing there and everybody wanna get in. Itâ€™s like a club. You canâ€™t get in. Everybodyâ€™s trying to get in. The big bodyguards are standing there, and Jesus come out like a promoter. He let all the bad bitches in. â€œLet her in.â€ â€œThem two right there. Let that girl in right there.â€ â€œLet the two girls.â€ â€œOh, Iâ€™ll text you.â€ [chuckles] Yeah. You wasnâ€™t going to heaven. But all them Black ghetto mothers in heaven, theyâ€™ve been letting their sons in. They got a side door up there. Them Black mothers been lettinâ€™ them, â€œCome on, baby, come on. Get in here!â€ â€œYou smell like weed. Come on!â€ â€œPut the wings on. Put the wings on.â€ â€œZip it up. Flap, flap!â€ â€œAct like youâ€™re a angel.â€ I love yâ€™all, Indianapolis. God bless yâ€™all.

<END>

<START>
Manâ€¦
We were waiting for you.
Iâ€™m happy youâ€™re here. Iâ€™m happy all of you are here. I have so much to tell you. Youâ€™re comfortable? You can talk back to me. I want you guys to feel that. This only works if we feel like family. I know the cameraâ€™s here and itâ€™s a whole thing. Itâ€™s a big night, itâ€™s a lot of pressure. That kinda thing, you know? I want you guys to feel as comfortable as I hope to be. We got a lot of shit to talk about. Iâ€™m happy youâ€™re here. I need you.
I wanna talk about secrets! Secrets! I should whisper it, right? I carried a lot of secrets my whole life. I feel like I was birthed into them. One of my biggest, one of my last held secrets is my name. My name is not Jerrod. Welcome to the show, everybody. I thought we were being honest tonight. Jerrodâ€™s my middle name. I was given the name Jerrod by my brother, Joe. Heâ€™s, like, seven years older than me. They just trusted a kid to name a kid, but whatever. Iâ€™m thankful for that. Without him Iâ€™d have to go by my real name, my first name, which we donâ€™t talk about. It is not good. I donâ€™t like it. Iâ€™ve always hated that name, no one calls me that except for my mom.
My dad named meâ€¦ He combined his dadâ€™s first name and my momâ€™s dadâ€™s first name and mushed them together. Not to make something elegant, like William Edward or something like that. Itâ€™s more like Toyotathon.
I hate that name. Iâ€™ve hidden that name my whole life. I used to get it removed from the yearbook. Every year in high school I would bribe somebody. Itâ€™d cost me 20 dollars to get my first name taken out of it. I never let people see my driverâ€™s license. I had it taken off my bank cards. Iâ€™ve always been ashamed of it. Iâ€™ve always hidden it. And itâ€™s funny because itâ€™s a name given to me to honor two people. Itâ€™s supposed to be this gift to both my granddads.
And it almost seemed kind of fucked up that I hide that, that I like tuck it away, but thatâ€™s because you donâ€™t know my grandfathers. If you knew them, youâ€™d know keeping a secret is the only way to honor them. Thatâ€™s kind of who they were. They were granddads.
Iâ€™m named after two men who most of their lives, most of their sex lives at least were secrets. My momâ€™s dad had four kids with my momâ€™s mom, his wife, and four kids outside of that marriage, just kind of scattered about. My dadâ€™s dad had five kids with his wife and about 23 outside of the marriage. Yeah. I come from a long line of cool n*ggers.
23. Dillon, South Carolina. Jim Gowens is his name. We donâ€™t have the same last name because my dad was an outside kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thereâ€™s no easy way to say your grandma was a side piece. I wanna say it was something else. Theyâ€™d prefer I used terms like â€œaffairâ€ and whatever, but nah, thatâ€™s not what it was. She was fuckinâ€™ a married n*gger and thatâ€™s justâ€¦
So my grandma had three kids by a married man, my uncle Pete, my dad, my aunt Nell, and his wife found out and confronted my grandma about it. I like to think it was on some â€œColor Purpleâ€ shit, like she crossed the field or whatever. But she confronted my grandma and demanded that she stop sleeping with her man, and my grandma fucked him again and had my Aunt Cat. I think sheâ€™s where I get my ambition from.
My aunt Cat is proud of that, by the way. Sheâ€™ll tell everybody her origin story. Sheâ€™s like: â€œDonâ€™t nobody tell me who to sleep with.â€ â€œAnd then she fucked him again and had me out of spite.â€ â€œThatâ€™s me, Iâ€™m the spite baby.â€ She loves that shit.
But we donâ€™t really talk about it. We donâ€™t really talk about it. My dad doesnâ€™t really know his dad, but he still felt enough pride to name me after him.
My momâ€™s dad was also like a cheater, but she lived in the house that he was cheating from. And so when youâ€™re that family, you learn not to say shit. My mom, I guess, learned from her mom.
Iâ€™m trying to paint a picture of a world before Destinyâ€™s Child, where women got cheated on and it didnâ€™t play out like a Terry McMillan novel. It was much more quiet than that. They just kind of existed with the secret. They knew, but they didnâ€™t know. Itâ€™s weird, itâ€™s like generations of that, generations of just seeing things, not seeing things.
I saw my parentsâ€™ sex tape. This is kind of a side tangent. I was about twelve years old. I came home from school early. I would watch my dadâ€¦ If you got a dad or an older brother, they mightâ€™ve had a porn stash. This was the â€™90s. My dad kept his tapes in a Nike box in the bedroom closet on the top shelf, beside a gun and a jar of nickels.
And I remember putting this tape in, and it was about 15 seconds before I started recognizing the bedroom. I know those sheets, they got lemons on them.
But thatâ€™s the thing, I never told my family. I never told my parents that Iâ€™d seen that. Itâ€™s odd because itâ€™s one of those thingsâ€¦ You canâ€™t talk about sex with your parents, not that anybody really wants to, but you just canâ€™t. And youâ€™re only here because your parents fucked, isnâ€™t that kinda funny? Your dad came in your mom and youâ€™re here.
Have you ever been watching a movie with your parents and a sex scene came on and you just gotta be, like, â€œnope, no itâ€™s notâ€.
Things that exist, but donâ€™t exist. Itâ€™s things that are right there, hiding in plain sight.
My father had me and my brother with my mom, and then he had four kids with a bitch named Raneta. Itâ€™s not that I hate her name. Itâ€™s just that it sounds like a villain in a Tyler Perry movie.
And other kids, he had other kids. My dad was, he was really out there, man. He was really, really out there. And I knew about it since I was a kid. It was a small town, and itâ€™s a secret that he thought he was keeping from the family. He thought he was doing a good job keeping the secret. But I found out. I never told him that I knew. My brother found out. He didnâ€™t tell him.
Itâ€™s funny to live in a house with someone knowing who they are, knowing that theyâ€™re cheating on your mom and not saying anything to him.
He used to go out on Friday nights, he would say he was going to work. My dad is a truck driver, which by the way, if youâ€™re cheating on your wife and youâ€™re looking for a profession that allows just long blackout dates, get your CDLs and hit the road. I really recommend it.
He would say he was going to a second job on Friday nights, but he would get dressed up, and I mean dressed up by North Carolina dad standards. He tucked his t-shirt into his jeans. He would say he was going to work with cologne on. Do you understand what Iâ€™m saying? Itâ€™s just, like, a liar.
And it would just leave me as a kid knowing thatâ€¦ Itâ€™s weird to know it, to know, to really, really know, and not say anything. I was scared. I didnâ€™t know what to say. I donâ€™t know what I couldâ€™ve done. I donâ€™t know if I wouldâ€™ve said anything if I had the courage, because I only saw this secret as something that couldâ€™ve torn our family apart. If my mom found out, I thought it would be over. He was fucking my homeboy TJâ€™s aunt. This was this story TJ told me about, and thatâ€™s hard because TJ, he didnâ€™t want to snitch. In the hoodâ€¦ I didnâ€™t wanna snitch!
He told me, he was like: â€œMan, I came home from school the other dayâ€ â€œand I went to my auntâ€™s houseâ€ â€œand your pop was just there on the couch.â€ What? Heâ€™s like: â€œYeah, yeah, yeah, he was just on the couch.â€ He saw my dad sitting on the couch. He walks in, heâ€™s excited to see my dad. He knows my dad very well, they used to play Madden together. He knows him. Heâ€™s like: â€œMr. Carmichael, what are you doing here?â€ And my dad, being caught, under pressure, you know what he did? He just squinted his eyes and pretended he was somebody else. I donâ€™t know how that was supposed to work. He literally was just like: â€œMr. Carmichael? I donâ€™t know who youâ€™re talking about.â€ He just grabbed his shit and got the fuck outta there. My father. And TJ was there with his aunt and he said: â€œDo you know who that was?â€ â€œThatâ€™s my best friendâ€™s dad. Thatâ€™s Joe Carmichael.â€ And she said: â€œJoe Carmichael?â€ â€œHe told me his name was Jerry Rice.â€
Thatâ€™s right, thatâ€™s right. My father was telling bitches his name was Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice. Do you know how absurd that is? And I got so many questions, things he wonâ€™t talk about. Did you say it? Did you act surprised? â€œDid you go: What? Thereâ€™s another Jerry Rice?â€ Was it all part of the game? Did he go: â€œYeah, my name is Jerry Rice. I know. I get it all the time.â€ How did he react?
He was a wild man, he was really out there, really, really out there, just holding it in, just holding it all in. He had a double or triple bypass surgery, I guess thatâ€™s where it went. Itâ€™s fine. Iâ€™m paying for his health insurance. Donâ€™t groan for the man. Iâ€™m keeping him alive right now.
I made him tell my mom. It became too much. Itâ€™s a secret that I think I was happy keeping as a child because I thought it made sense for the family, but then it was embarrassing, first of all. Because people knew. It seems like everyone knew, but my mom, and thatâ€™s really tough because my mom is a very sweet, loving, trusting, Christian, God-fearing woman, who was just standing by her man, trusting her husband. And my dad was just, you know, he was really out there.
I got really drunk in London and I was like: â€œItâ€™s time.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna confront him about it.â€ And itâ€™s hard. This was hard because this is a tough man. Again, he kept a sawed-off shotgun in the closet by the porn, and itâ€™s not easy. Itâ€™s not easy. I was really afraid, but I remember starting the call saying: â€œListen, this will all go well as long as you donâ€™t lie to me.â€ And I was just almost in tears and just so emotional. â€œI know about everything, man. I know about Renita,â€ â€œand the kids, and the blah blah blah,.â€
You know what he said? He actually said: â€œI always knew youâ€™d be the one.â€ Thatâ€™s what he said. He knew.
So I made him tell my mom. He waited until I was back home in North Carolina to tell her, fucking pussy. I know, thatâ€™s a pussy thing to do, right? He waited. He needed the support. He waited until I was home. And this was his big plan to tell my mom. He was like: â€œOkay, so you and your brother, you take her out to dinner.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna stay home. And then you bring her back from dinner.â€ â€œYou drop her off, sheâ€™ll come in the house, and then Iâ€™m gonna tell her.â€ And I was like: â€œOkay, you want me to hide a gun behind the toilet, too?â€ â€œWhat kinda Godfather plan is this?â€
But I went along with it. It took a lot for him. That dinner was the worst dinner Iâ€™ve ever had in my entire life. I took my mom to a hibachi restaurant.
Earlier that day, I had taken my nieces to see the â€œTrollsâ€ movie. I love going to the movies with my nieces. Itâ€™s the best. Theyâ€™re not my kids so I can just get high and do fun shit with them, itâ€™s the best. And weâ€™d seen the â€œTrollsâ€ movie, and I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve seen it, spoiler alert. The premise is that these are these colorful trolls that are singing and all types of shit, and if something devastating happens to them, they lose all of their color. I remember thinking that the whole dinner, that whole night is just looking at my mom, just looking in her eyes going: â€œSheâ€™s going to lose her color.â€ It was really, really scary.
Mind you, all of this happened at a hibachi grill, so Iâ€™m looking in her eyes, but thereâ€™s a flame and we gotta clap every couple minutes. Heâ€™s juggling salt and pepper shakers. â€œYay, okay. My mom is about to be fucking destroyed,â€ â€œbut this is a great trick.â€ I get mad when I donâ€™t get a Japanese chef. Sometimes theyâ€™re Mexican and theyâ€™re just passing them off asâ€¦ Anyway. How many Japanese chefs are there in North Carolina? Iâ€™m piecing this together now.
I brought her home. I dropped her off. I went to my brotherâ€™s house, and we waited by the phone very, very anxiously, me, my brother, and sister-in-law just waited, very nervous. And then my mom called. I could hear in her voice that sheâ€™d been crying. And Iâ€™ll never forget, her first words were: â€œIâ€™m okay.â€ And he told her, begged for her forgiveness. She forgave him, she stayed.
Itâ€™s kinda anti-climactic, I know. She actually made him breakfast the next morning. Iâ€™ll never forget that fact. And mostly because itâ€™s an embarrassing fact to admit. Itâ€™s not how I thought the story would play out. Itâ€™s somehow worse. But it was out in the open.
And once that was done, I was left alone feeling like a liar because I had a secret, one that I kept from my mother, and my father, and my family, my friends, and you, all of you, professionally, personally. And the secret is that Iâ€™m gay.
Thank you for that.
We love you.
Thatâ€™s very sweet. I really appreciate that. It means a lot. And Iâ€™m accepting the love, I really appreciate the love. My, kind of, ego wants to rebel against it, you clap and youâ€™re very sweet and youâ€™re very kind, and I appreciate it. Part of me wants to be like: â€œIâ€™m fucking gay.â€ â€œIâ€™m not fucking retarded.â€
Because I can feel it, bro. I can feel it. Thereâ€™s a lot that happens coming out. Iâ€™m telling you guys and I see the Yankee fitteds. Some of yâ€™all are just like: â€œShit, we at a gay show, bro?â€ This is for HBO. You know how many n*ggers just turned the TV off saying to their girl right now â€œwe gotta watch something elseâ€? Like, yâ€™all clapped. A lot of you clapped and you felt it. Some of you didnâ€™t really wanna clap. You were just like: â€œWe gotta do that shit. Weâ€™re in New York and thereâ€™s cameras.â€
Thatâ€™s okay, I get it. I came out to my friends.
We love you.
I wanna accept that, you know? It feels like I didnâ€™t earn it. Itâ€™s like, what did I do, suck a Dominican dudeâ€™s dick? And then yâ€™all clapped for that, you know? Because I rebelled against that. I really did, bro, I rebelled against it my whole life. I never thought Iâ€™d come out. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever, ever, ever come out. Probably at many points in my life I thought Iâ€™d rather die than confront the truth of that. I didnâ€™t actually say it to people, because I know it changes peopleâ€™s, some people, it changes their perception of me. I canâ€™t control that. Iâ€™m from an environment where I was, kind of, raised to be a man, whatever that means. Didnâ€™t expect gay babies, you know what Iâ€™m saying? You donâ€™t see old ladies looking at a toddler being, like: â€œLook at his cheeks. I bet heâ€™s gonna be a top.â€ â€œGet that baby some prep now.â€
I feel you, bro. Iâ€™m with you. Iâ€™m from the hood. Sometimes Iâ€™ll be in the shower like: â€œN*gger, Iâ€™m really gay. Fuck, dude!â€ You know? Shit is shocking to me, too. I didnâ€™t know. Itâ€™s fucked up all my relationships. I had a boyfriend, me and that n*gga talked to each other like men. Weâ€™d say shit like: â€œI wanna suck your dick, bro.â€ None of that gay shit over here. Sometimes weâ€™re making out and just whispering â€œno homoâ€ to each other. Just tonguing that n*gger down being, like, â€œpauseâ€.
I feel you. I got mostly straight friends. Them n*ggers didnâ€™t wanna hear that shit. My homeboy, Jamar, saidâ€¦ This is one of my best friends. I let him sleep on my couch when he needed it. I was always there for him. He told me he felt like he was tricked into having a gay best friend. He said: â€œI wouldâ€™ve never signed up for this.â€ And I said: â€œN*gger, you owe me 85000 dollars.â€
Gotta accept the love, man. I need the love. I need it. I was really out here lying, though.
Thatâ€™s the thing, I came out too late, a little too late. That â€œit gets better shit is for the kidsâ€. Thatâ€™s not for an adult man figuring himself out. They donâ€™t want that. Nobody wants that shit. All my friends felt like I was just duplicitous, like I was just lying to them. They didnâ€™t know who I was. They all reacted like Sally Field in Mrs. Doubtfire. They were like: â€œThe whole time?â€ They were very mad about that shit.
It cleared up my relationship with all my black homegirls. My friend Ashley told me before I came out she could sense it. She was like: â€œPlease just tell me youâ€™re gay so this all makes sense.â€ I guess there are only so many times you can Facetime a woman to see if your outfit looks okay before they start having some questions. They were the toughest. Black women were the toughest people to come out to, but also the most supportive. Iâ€™m very, very thankful for all of the black ladies in my life who have supported me through that, through all of it, all of it. Theyâ€™re not homophobic at all. Theyâ€™re racist as a motherfucker. They donâ€™t like that I had a white boyfriend. See? You see what Iâ€™m saying? You see that change? You can be gay, but n*gger, what? You date white boys, really? Is that a shock? Surprise, surprise. No more secrets. Iâ€™m gonna tell you all.
You heard her say â€œwowâ€? Thatâ€™s the sound of a Black woman that feels doubly betrayed.
My sister is on that shit, too. Listen, Iâ€™m used to it. I grew up just in the hood on some real strong masculine shit. It plays out. Look, Iâ€™ll say this, I actually think that it is important to say this, I believe in the black family. I think that black men should marry black women, and have black babies and raise them to be smart, just good citizens, educated. I think thatâ€™s very, very important. A hundred percent. I think gay black men should be able to fuck whoever the fuck we want. What is the consequence? There are no black babies coming from the kind of sex I have, okay? Itâ€™s all getting flushed. It doesnâ€™t matter. Doesnâ€™t matter.
The black girls, they try. I would send them pictures of my boyfriend and they would ignore that heâ€™s white. They would just be likeâ€¦ I remember I sent a picture to my homegirl Tiffany and she was like: â€œHe got some pretty glasses.â€ I was like: â€œNah, bitch, itâ€™s not the glasses.â€ â€œLook at the skin of my vanilla king.â€ I didnâ€™t call him that. Iâ€™m hiding nothing from you guys.
But your name.
Now you guys are too much like my family. Letâ€™s go back to the audience-performer relationship we had before. Itâ€™s a lot. Iâ€™m really happy we had this moment ofâ€¦
My brother texted me earlier today and said: â€œIâ€™m missing my first special taping,â€ â€œbut I know itâ€™s necessary. I love you.â€ Thatâ€™s very sweet. I love him. Heâ€™s there for me as much as he can be. He tries. He tries and I love him. I love him a lot. I love Joe so much. Heâ€™s all I got in a lot of this. I wish heâ€™d try harder. Iâ€™m probably a little mad at him, a little bit mad. Heâ€™s my big brother, heâ€™s supposed to protect me. He loves me despite, thatâ€™s the thing. Itâ€™s a little condescending, you know? Itâ€™s love with an asterisk. â€œI donâ€™t really fuck with the gay shit, but I still love you.â€
Thatâ€™s that masculine shit. I could feel the distance between us. And I hate that because no one would want that. It makes me feel unwanted. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. Itâ€™s like heâ€™s looking down on me and accepting me despite.
Itâ€™s especially hurtful just because I make so much more money than this n*gger. Itâ€™s not even close. I donâ€™t wanna be gross and talk about money, but the difference is millions and millions of dollars.
I love my brother a lot. Heâ€™s a nice guy. Nice asâ€¦ Iâ€™m saying that. He has five kids who I love a lot, a lot. My nieces mean a lot to me. My oldest niece, Joliette, sheâ€™s fourteen now and I like talking to her. I think sheâ€™s so smart and sheâ€™s really beautiful. Her face reminds me of my momâ€™s. I have a five-year-old niece and then four-year-old twin nieces and I love them. I like spending time with them because Iâ€™m not hiding anything when Iâ€™m with them, Iâ€™m just with them. Weâ€™re just there playing. Weâ€™re just eating ice cream or theyâ€™re trying to braid my hair. They are easy to talk about it with, you know? Joliette, thereâ€™s no pre-tense.
Itâ€™s harder with the older ones. I came out to my dad again. I say again, cause he forgets. Itâ€™s cognitive dissonance. I have to remind him. I have to re-up every so often. Thereâ€™s a part of him that likes that I came out. I donâ€™t think he necessarily wants a gay son, but he likes that me coming out takes some of the heat off him. Like when he first found out he was like â€œno, itâ€™s coolâ€, â€œI fucked up, you fucked upâ€. â€œYou gay, I did what I didâ€¦ Que seraâ€¦â€ My fatherâ€™s dream is that Iâ€™m bi. Thatâ€™s all he wants. Thatâ€™s all he wants, the hope, somewhere on the horizon, that Iâ€™m still getting pussy. Thatâ€™s all he wants. Heâ€™s probably actually disappointed in both of me and my brother. Heâ€™s probably looking at us like: â€œWait, so you gay and you only fuck your wife?â€ â€œWhat kinda nerds am I raising here?â€
I told my dad, I said: â€œI know two things for a fact.â€ â€œI will never be an astronaut and Iâ€™m a gay man.â€ And you know what my father said? He said: â€œDonâ€™t give up on the moon, son.â€
I hid it from my mom for the most part. I was afraid that her reaction would be to just go inside with it. I love her a lot. I love her dearly. And Iâ€™m trying to describe her without sounding clichÃ© and describe the love that I have for her. I really feel like I was one of her closest friends. I feel like I have always looked out for her.
I remember on the call, the last time I talked about being gay with my Mom, she said: â€œI canâ€™t go against Jesus.â€ And it just bothers me. I get it, cause sheâ€™sâ€¦ Sheâ€™s doing the best she can. I think. Sheâ€™s trying to accept. I donâ€™t know what sheâ€™s trying to do. I think sheâ€™s trying to accept it. Part of me knows sheâ€™s at home trying to pray the gay away. I get a little mad sometimes. Any time I donâ€™t match with a dude on RIA Iâ€™m like: â€œI bet that bitch over there praying to God.â€
I feel it too. It fucks with me because this is a religion that I still believe in. Iâ€™m still a Christian and itâ€™s taken a lot, itâ€™s taken a whole lot because Iâ€™ve had to reconfigure God and what God is and what he means in order to accept myself. I had to kind of rebuild. And with my momâ€¦
Iâ€™m sorry. A lot of it is not reallyâ€¦ Itâ€™s kinda happening in real time, so itâ€™s not totally worked out. Forgive me.
I think sheâ€™sâ€¦ She thinks not reacting is the best reaction. I think sheâ€™s been rewarded for staying quiet, you know? Itâ€™s like with her dad, so she gives me nothing. Even hate starts to feel like love because thatâ€™s acknowledgement. Itâ€™s not just nice. Itâ€™s not pleasant, itâ€™s real and that feelsâ€¦ I think that would feel better. I wish she would yell at me. I wish she would tell me to not come home. I wish sheâ€™d call me a f*ggot like my Uncle June Bug did. Yeah. It hurt my feelings, but I was like: â€œN*gga, your name June Bug.â€ Iâ€™d rather get called a f*ggot than June Bug. Anything, anything, anything.
Sheâ€™s nice. Sheâ€™s sweet. She ignores it. The worst of her is cold, like really, really cold. I mean sheâ€™s a nice lady, but like, thereâ€™s a part of her thatâ€™s reallyâ€¦ She can shut people out. She can ignore, she can block and like, go inside.
But you gave yourself so many years. Why donâ€™t you give her that time?
Iâ€™d love to give her all the time in the world, you know? I donâ€™t know how much time it would take. I donâ€™t know how much time we have left. Just in general, one of my biggest fears is my parents funeral, just the thought of one them dying without saying everything, without contending, without expressing it all.
And my momâ€™s in her early sixties and she has time and sheâ€™sâ€¦ I also just donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s when people change.
They do.
Maybe. I donâ€™t know. It sounds like a joke, but like part of me feels like if I ask my mom to change this much about her is like, you ever see a 90-year-old get a college degree? On the newsâ€¦ And youâ€™re like: â€œBitch, now?â€ â€œGood luck in the fucking job market.â€
Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t find hope for change, but I think even if she was young, thereâ€™s a part of my mom thatâ€™s very, very cold. I know it because I have it, I can be that. Thatâ€™s why my last real secret is that Iâ€™mâ€¦ People think Iâ€™m nice. Nah, Iâ€™m like my Mom. Fuck everybody. Very selfish. Very, very, very, very selfish. I smile. Very polite about it. I lie to everybody face. â€œYeah, we should get dinner!â€
You know, lies. How you lie to people? Iâ€™m afraid of notâ€¦ Man, just like my Mom, is that performance of like who youâ€™re supposed to be. Like Iâ€™m afraid of not smiling. I smile a lot. I feel like if I donâ€™t smile, I look like the n*ggers that shot Malcom X. I know.
Iâ€™m afraid of things getting awkward. Like weird. Like even this moment, Iâ€™m like â€œman, I should probably think of a jokeâ€. Shit is falling apart out here.
Do you wish you didnâ€™t tell her?
No, no. I stayed in the closet for a long time. I think because of my mom I felt likeâ€¦ Itâ€™s not like I could bring a dude home to her, so whatâ€™s the point? But as much as she believes in God, I believe in personal growth and feeling free. I feel freer.
We say things like: â€œSometimes you grow and you gotta leave people behind.â€ â€œPeople are in your life for a reason or a season.â€ Or these kinds of clichÃ© sayings. Itâ€™s hard when that person is your mom.
You think a lot of the guilt is your dadâ€™s guilt?
I carry some guilt. I think because I was complicit in the lie, I guess. I thought I was protecting her. I always felt like my momâ€™s protector. I always felt likeâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to explain this concept. I always felt likeâ€¦ I always felt like the result of her prayers.
My mom, one of her favorite Bible verses is, I think itâ€™s Jeremiah Chapter 33: â€œAsk me and I will tell you things you donâ€™t know and canâ€™t find out.â€
Do you think without your momâ€™s approval youâ€™ll be okay? That eventually this will be something that youâ€™ll be okay with?
I think without my momâ€™s approvalâ€¦ Iâ€™d like to believe I will be okay. I think Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time trying to supplement that love and Iâ€™m very thankful because I have some very, very good friends. Really, really good people who are thereâ€¦ I think itâ€™s something that I kind of search for. When thereâ€™s distance between me and my mom, itâ€™s the times I feel the most like an orphan. I feel abandoned. Iâ€™m sorry, that laugh was fake.
Iâ€™m trying to make jokes. I wish this moment werenâ€™t so weird, man. I think like, what do I want from her? I know sheâ€™ll see this. I donâ€™t know what will happen. You guys got any ideas? I donâ€™t know what else toâ€¦
Iâ€™ve been trying to be very honest because my whole life was shrouded in secrets. And I figured the only route I havenâ€™t tried was the truth, so Iâ€™m saying everything. Hereâ€™s everything. I feel okay. Iâ€™m very thankful for tonight.
Rothaniel. My nameâ€™s Rothaniel.
Goodnight, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.

[upbeat music]
[sentimental music]
[announcer] Please welcome Taylor Tomlinson!
[audience cheering]
Thank you so much!
[cheering]
Thank you! Thank you, guys, so much! Thank you! I so, so appreciate you guys being here. Itâ€™s been a rough couple of years. I got bangs at one point. Shit got dark.
[audience laughs]
I didnâ€™t even want bangs. I just needed people to check on me. And it works, by the way. You post a selfie in bangs, everybodyâ€™s like, â€œFire emoji. You go, girl!â€ Then they text you, like, â€œYou okay?â€
[audience laughs]
Hereâ€™s what I did. I got bangs and then two days later, I did mushrooms for the first time. [audience laughs] And as soon as I did those mushrooms, I was like, â€œI shouldâ€™ve done these first. [audience laughs] Probably wouldnâ€™t have gotten these bangs if I forgave myself, huh?â€
[audience laughs]
But you know what? Having bangs feels exactly like being on mushrooms. The whole time, youâ€™re just looking at your friends, like, â€œDo I look weird? [audience laughs] You guys would tell me if I looked weird, right? Is itâ€¦ Is it bad different? Is it not goodâ€¦ You know what? I changed my mind. I donâ€™t want to do it. Itâ€™s too late? Itâ€™s already happening? Okay, no, I can be this person.â€ I got back into therapy. Anybody in therapy? [audience cheers] Mostly women. Thatâ€™s the problem.
[audience laughs]
Itâ€™s very hard to stay in therapy. My old therapist told me that when I get close to people, I have a tendency to self-sabotage. And I thought that was bullshit, so I ghosted her. [audience laughs] And thenâ€¦ I finally went back because I finally dated enough people who all gave me the exact same feedback about my shitty personality. You know, that romantic quota you hit where youâ€™re, like, [laughing] â€œUh-oh! Might be me!
[audience laughs]
Oh, the reviews are in and they are [blows raspberry] unanimous. Thatâ€™s a bummer.â€ So after a really bad breakup a few years ago, I finally took a long hard look at myself and said, â€œOkay, Taylor, five out of five dudes all think that in fights, you behave like a raccoon trapped in a trash bag.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œSo maybe itâ€™s time to get some Klonopin or a rabies shot.â€ [audience laughs] I am fully medicated now. Anybody else? Anti-depressants? [audience cheers] Medication? Yeah. Nice. What are we on? Shout it out.
[audience shouting indistinctly]
Zoloft, Lexapro. Oh! Look at us. Gangâ€™s all here! [audience laughs] Oh my God! Iâ€™m also on something. I would never say what, thatâ€™s very personal, butâ€¦ [audience laughs] No, Iâ€™m kidding. Iâ€™m on a few things. I am on Klonopin as needed for panic attacks. Iâ€™m so glad I have Klonopin now because before I had medication for it, I would have panic attacks right when I had to be somewhere, which is the worst time to get them â€™cause then you just have to pinch the panic attack off like a shit you donâ€™t have time to take.
[audience laughs]
You know what I mean? When youâ€™re, like, â€œOkay, I got 60% of that out of my system. [audience laughs] Iâ€™m not done but I gotta go to work. [audience laughs] I will get to the other 40 later or Iâ€™ll finish in the big stall at lunch if no oneâ€™s in there.
[audience laughs]
I got put on something else for sleep because I have night terrors. Thereâ€™s no fun, casual way to say that. [giggles] â€œWake up screaming andâ€¦â€ [audience laughs] These sleeper time pills I got are great. They donâ€™t stop the nightmares but they do hold you down while theyâ€™re happening.
[audience laughs]
Which sounds bad but before, Iâ€™d wake up in the middle so afraid and now, I stay asleep until the nightmareâ€™s natural conclusion, [audience laughs] which provides you with some closure. [audience laughs] Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, he stabs me at the end. [audience gasps] Okay, plot twist, M. Nightmare Shyamalan.â€
[audience laughs]
I thought I was on an anti-depressant. It turns out Iâ€™m not. It turns out Iâ€™m actually on a mood stabilizer that they use as an anti-depressant. Fun fact about prescription drugs. Everything they prescribe, they actually use for, like, four different things. So you donâ€™t really know what your deal is until you find a combo that works and then Google all your pills by yourself.
[audience laughs]
So after years of trial and error, I finally found a combination of things that worked for me, and six months ago, I decided to Google it â€™cause what the hell. And it turns out that everything Iâ€™m taking is primarily used for bipolar disorder. So I went back to my psychiatrist and I was, like, â€œHey. [audience laughs] Do we thinkâ€¦?â€ [audience laughs] And she was, like, â€œOh! Yeah!â€ [audience laughs] And I was, like, â€œIs this how you fucking tell people?â€ [audience laughs] And sheâ€™s, like, â€œNo, of course not. We didnâ€™t know. Iâ€™m glad we figured it out.â€ And I was, like, â€œWe?â€
[audience laughs]
I said, â€œYou really didnâ€™t know that I was bipolar?â€ And she goes, â€œNo, of course not. We thought we were treating anxiety and depression.â€ And I said, â€œOkay. â€˜Cause this kinda feels like a putting your dogâ€™s medication in cheese situation.â€ [audience laughs] And I was, like, â€œI donâ€™t know how I feel about this diagnosis.â€ And she goes, â€œWell, if it makes you feel better, you donâ€™t have to say, â€˜I am bipolar.â€™ You can say, â€˜I have bipolar.'â€
[audience chuckles]
Which feels a lot like someone going, â€œI said you were being a bitch.â€ [audience laughs] Iâ€™m so glad I know that Iâ€™m bipolar now. I mean, I have the right meds, I got a mood ring, Iâ€™m handling it. [audience laughs] But when I first found out, it was a very tough pill to swallow. And Iâ€™ve swallowed a lot of pills.
[audience laughs]
Because when you first find out something like that, youâ€™re, like, â€œOh man, am I gonna tell anybody? Should I tell anybody? And if I do tell people, am I hot and/or talented enough to be an inspiration?â€ [audience laughs]
[audience claps, cheers]
Like, if I have a thing and someone else has that thing and they find out I have it too, are they gonna feel good or bad with that information? Because when I got diagnosed, they started listing names. They were, like, â€œYou know who else is bipolar? Selena Gomez.â€ And I was, like, â€œThat does make me feel better. [audience laughs] She is very pretty.
[audience laughs]
Okay, Iâ€™ll be bipolar.â€ [audience laughs] I did not grow up in a household that was very, like, mental health-conscious. Like, we were very religious. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever tried to tell your conservative dad that you have a mental health issue. It doesnâ€™t go great. When I was in high school, I was like, â€œDad, I think Iâ€™m depressed.â€ And he was, like, â€œYou just need some protein. Get a scoop of peanut butter.â€ [audience laughs] Yeah, thereâ€™s a lot of dads out there just white-knuckling it through life right now, clinging to a jar of chunky Jif like itâ€™s the answer, just a buoy in the storm. â€œItâ€™ll pass!â€
[audience laughs]
The only mental health advice my dad ever gave me is I was having panic attacks in high school and I didnâ€™t know what they were and I was very stressed out. And I was, like, â€œI donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know what to do when I feel like this. I donâ€™t know what to do.â€ And he goes, â€œAlright. All I can tell you is that when you feel like this, get as far away from the people you care about as possibleâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦until you feel different.â€ Which is advice you give a werewolf, likeâ€¦ [audience laughs] â€œJust run into the woods â€™til youâ€™re not a monster anymore. Donâ€™t let them see you change. They wonâ€™t accept you for what you truly are.â€ [audience laughs] And I had friends who scared me too when I was trying to get on medication. They were, like, â€œUgh, I tried. I tried anti-depressants. I didnâ€™t like how I felt on them. I didnâ€™t feel like myself.â€ And now that Iâ€™m on them, Iâ€™m, like, â€œYeah, me neither! Itâ€™s the best.â€
[audience laughs]
Okay? And I do feel like myself. I just feel like now someoneâ€™s sitting on me going, â€œShh! [audience laughs] Stop talking. You will ruin everything. We areâ€¦ We are trying to help you. Youâ€™d be married right now if you just shut the hell up. [audience laughs] Remember that? Yeah, us too. We are trying to help you. Go to sleep. Choose a different adventure.â€ [audience laughs] And they warn you about the side effects when you get on medication. They go, â€œYou know, your sex drive might go down.â€ And Iâ€™ll be honest, I have experienced that since I got on medication, but I canâ€™t tell if my sex drive is lower or if my self-esteem is just higher now.
[audience laughs]
You know?
[audience claps, cheers]
Itâ€™s, like, am I not in the mood, or do I just not need the validation? Which is it? Because depression will bring you to your knees and youâ€™re, like, â€œWhile Iâ€™m down here, might as well make someone feel good. Iâ€¦ do not want to waste a trip.â€ [audience whoops] If youâ€™re not laughing, congrats on your serotonin. [audience laughs] And if youâ€™re, like, â€œWhatâ€™s serotonin?â€ Donâ€™t worry. You have enough.
[audience laughs]
I wasnâ€™t sure if I was gonna talk about it on stage, and then I needed new material and I was, like, â€œFire sale! Everything goes.â€ [audience laughs] No, truthfully, I was surprised that I felt so bad about it â€™cause I think Iâ€™m pretty open-minded. And I donâ€™t think anybody should feel bad if they get diagnosed with a mental illness â€™cause itâ€™s just information about you that helps you know how to take better care of yourself. [audience cheers] Yeah. Being bipolar, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with it. Being bipolar is like not knowing how to swim. It might be embarrassing to tell people and it might be hard to take you certain places.
[audience laughs]
[audience continues laughing]
But they have arm floaties. [audience laughs] And if you just take your arm floaties, you can go wherever the hell you want. [audience laughs] Andâ€¦ I know some of you are, like, â€œBut Taylor, what if people judge me for taking arm floaties?â€ Well, those people donâ€™t care if you live or die, so maybe who cares? [audience whoops] Maybe fuck those people a little. [audience cheers] I donâ€™t know. That being said, you have to take your arm floaties [audience laughs] because itâ€™s not cool to know you canâ€™t swim, go to the public pool anyway, and jump into the deep end, making it everyone elseâ€™s problem.
[audience laughs]
And you thrash around going, â€œIâ€™m good!â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œYouâ€™re literally drowning.â€ And then someone nice and handsome jumps in to help you. And youâ€™re, like, â€œSee? Iâ€™m fine. I can totally swim.â€ And theyâ€™re, like, â€œNo, youâ€™re holding him underwater. [audience laughs] You turned Kevin into an arm floaty [audience laughs] and thatâ€™s not a fair relationship for Kevin.â€ [audience laughs] Then someone floats by you on their back and youâ€™re, like, â€œWhat was that?â€ And theyâ€™re, like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s someone whose parents supported them in the poolâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦until they could be trusted not to die. [audience laughs] Here are your arm floaties.â€ [audience laughs] I was very nervous to tell friends of mine I was bipolar because I thought they would think of me differently. And then I told all my friends and nobody did and it was actually pretty insulting. [audience laughs] Because Iâ€™ve had friends tell me they were bipolar and I was, like, â€œWhat? You? Youâ€™re kidding.â€ And then I told my friends and they were, like, â€œThat checks out. Thatâ€™sâ€¦
[audience laughs]
That connects a lot of dots for us.â€ I told Dustin, one of my best friends in the whole world, and he goes, â€œYeah, your mental illness was kinda like your middle name. I didnâ€™t know what it was but I knew that you had one.â€ [audience laughs] Itâ€™s really good. That was not the feedback I kept getting from romantic partners, by the way. [audience laughs] Thatâ€™s not what finally made me get help. Every guy Iâ€™ve ever dated has told me I have trust issues, which is something liars say when youâ€™re on to them. [audience laughs] [in deep voice] â€œYou have trust issues, babe.â€ You have a hot co-worker and a locked phone, soâ€¦ [audience laughs] I have trust issues but I earned them, okay?
[audience laughs]
I absolutely earned them, like, I got cheated on in college. My college boyfriend was sleeping with sex workers behind my back, or prostitutes if youâ€™re old and donâ€™t know that wordâ€™s not okay to use anymore. Sometimes older crowd members could get confused â€™cause theyâ€™re, like, â€œWhat is a sex worker?â€ â€œIs that what my granddaughter does on Instagram?â€ [audience laughs] And youâ€™re, like, â€œNo, no, no, sheâ€™s just hot. Thatâ€™s a FabFitFun box.â€ â€œThatâ€™s a differentâ€¦â€ [audience laughs] â€œThatâ€™s a different thing.â€ [audience laughs] â€œYour granddaughter doesnâ€™tâ€¦ Thatâ€™s not a job.â€ â€œThatâ€™s not real.â€
[audience laughs]
You canâ€™t say prostitute anymore. Calling a sex worker a prostitute is like calling a comedian a clown. Youâ€™re not technically wrong but you are a fucking asshole, soâ€¦ [audience laughs] But I told my therapist I got cheated on like this and she didnâ€™t say what I wanted her to say, which was, â€œPoor baby, sweetie, this session is free.â€ [audience laughs] Instead, she goes, â€œWell, you might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.â€ And I was like, â€œOh!â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œNo, itâ€™s a bad thing.â€ And I was like, [audience laughs] â€œWell, then could you say I have self-fulfilling prophecy? [audience laughs] Is Selena Gomez a self-fulfilling prophecy?â€
[audience laughs]
And I said, â€œWhat does that mean, Iâ€™m a self-fulfilling prophecy?â€ And she goes, â€œWell, sometimes we expect someone to treat us poorly, so we treat them like theyâ€™re going to treat us poorly until they do.â€ â€œYou thought someone was gonna cheat on you, so you treated them like they were gonna cheat on you until they did cheat on you, and then you were like, â€˜See?'â€ [audience chuckles] And I was like, â€œOh.â€ [audience laughs] â€œSo Iâ€™m a witch.â€ [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] And sheâ€™s like, â€œOh! So close. Youâ€™re a bitch.â€ â€œYou gottaâ€¦â€ [audience laughs] Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatever. All I heard was Gryffindor!â€
[audience laughs]
I am working on my trust issues. I was so much worse when I first started seeing my therapist. I told her like first session, I was like, â€œThe guy Iâ€™m dating keeps answering my phone calls, â€˜Hey, beautiful?'â€ [audience laughs] And sheâ€™s like, â€œSo, whatâ€™s the problem?â€ I was like, â€œI mean, I donâ€™t know yet.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œBut when I find out who â€˜Beautifulâ€™ isâ€¦â€ [audience laughs] Sheâ€™s like, â€œDo you think it might be you?â€ I was like, â€œIâ€™m sorry. I thought we were here to work.â€
[audience laughs]
I think Iâ€™m cute or whatever now, but I was an ugly kid with honest parents, and that shit stays in your bones, alright? If you were an ugly kid with honest parents, I donâ€™t care how attractive you grow up to be, at any point, if someoneâ€™s like, â€œYou look really nice today,â€ youâ€™re like, â€œYeah, whatever. I know the Goddamn truth.â€
[audience laughs]
When I was ten, I said, â€œDad, am I pretty?â€ And his response was, â€œLook.â€ [audience laughs] â€œIâ€™m not the best looking guy, right?â€ â€œNo, but I wake up every morning and I try.â€ [audience laughs] â€œIâ€¦â€ â€œI take a shower, I put on a nice suit, and I do okay!â€ [audience whoops] And then he went to work.
[audience laughs]
And I became a comedian, I guess. [audience laughs] That was his response to his ten-year-old daughter. Just like, â€œYou and me, potato face, these were the cards we were dealt.â€ â€œGet clean and match.â€ â€œThatâ€™s all you can do. Donâ€™t sleep on wet hair. Canâ€™t do that.â€ â€œMaybe wear a hat sometimes. Cover up some of that head.â€ â€œIâ€™m sorry thereâ€™s so much of it.â€
[audience laughs]
I think Iâ€™m pretty. I have a big head. I know I do â€™cause every guy Iâ€™ve ever dated has made a point to be like, â€œI love your big head.â€ [audience laughs] Thatâ€™s my favorite thing guys do when they compliment the thing you hate most about yourself, theyâ€™re like, â€œI love your soft arms.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œOkay. [audience laughs] Yeah? I love your weird balls. How does it feel?
[audience laughs]
[audience cheers]
How does it feel to be accepted?â€
[audience chuckles]
Iâ€™m a nightmare to date. [audience laughs] Anything nice you do or say, Iâ€™m just like, â€œWhatever.â€ I dated a guy once who told me that flirting with me was like punching water. [audience laughs] And I was like, â€œWhy? â€˜Cause itâ€™s pointless or â€™cause you look stupid doing it?â€ [audience laughs] Heâ€™s like, â€œDid you hear it?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI heard it that time. Yeah.â€
[audience laughs]
And then he cheated on me, so, you know, prophecy fulfilled! [audience laughs] I canâ€™t help it. At the beginning of a relationship with a guy, I just assume anything nice he does is he a move he pulls on everybody and Iâ€™m not gonna fall for your choreography, sir.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, is thisâ€¦ is this your move? You open the car door for me on the date? [woman laughs] Is this like your move? [chuckles] This is how you do it? Thatâ€™s cute. Bet that works a lot.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œOh, is thisâ€¦ is this your move? You go with me to my grandpaâ€™s funeral, hold an umbrella over my head in the rain? [audience laughs] Is this likeâ€¦ Is this like your move? This is how you do it? [audience laughs] Like, â€˜Whoops, donâ€™t get wet.â€™ â€˜Oops! I am.â€™ Whatever. [audience laughs, cheers] This ainâ€™t my first rodeo. I used to have two grandpas.â€
[audience laughs]
[audience chuckles]
â€œOh, is thisâ€¦ Is this your move? [audience chuckles] You die next to me in a hospital bed at 86 years old holding my hand for all eternity? Is this like your move? This is how you get pussy?â€ [audience laughs] Heâ€™s like, â€œWeâ€™ve been together for 60 years.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re a fuckboy and I know it! [audience laughs] Donâ€™t bury me with this guy. Heâ€™s been dying with other people behind my back.
[audience laughs]
I canâ€™t prove it. Check his phone when he uses the bedpan.â€ [audience laughs] And thatâ€™s why weâ€™re in therapy. [audience laughs] People are scared to go to therapy because they think itâ€™s someone sitting in a chair going, â€œYou suck.â€ But itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s you in a chair going, â€œI suck.â€
[audience laughs]
And then your therapist is like, â€œThatâ€™s great. Letâ€™s start there.â€ [audience laughs] Therapy just helps you to get to the bottom of why youâ€™re trash, okay? You go into therapy and youâ€™re like, â€œHereâ€™s all the stuff that sucks about me.â€ And she goes, â€œOkay.â€ And she puts it all up on the wall like youâ€™re solving a crime together. Fun!
[audience laughs]
And then she gets some of that red string that detectives use at home when theyâ€™ve been thrown off the case for going rogue [audience laughs] and she starts connecting each crappy thing about you to each one of your corresponding childhood traumas, and youâ€™re like, â€œOh my God! Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m like this.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s why youâ€™re like this.â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œAm I fixed now?â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œGod, no!
[audience laughs]
No, no, no.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œWell, what do I do now?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWell, you keep coming back in here every week with your credit card.â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œWhat? Will I ever be fixed?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know. Bring your credit card!â€ [audience laughs] Iâ€™ve got to the bottom of a lot of stuff in therapy. Iâ€™m an emotional eater. I donâ€™t know if anybody else identifies with that.
[audience whoops]
Cool. Seven people. Everyone else is like, â€œNo, we just eat until weâ€™re almost full and then we thank God for the opportunity, okay.â€ [audience laughs] â€œFood is just fuel for me.â€ If youâ€™re one of those, fuck right off, for real. [audience laughs] Iâ€™ll refund your money. I donâ€™t need your support. [audience cheers] Iâ€™m doing fine. If you donâ€™t know what an emotional eater is, it just means you like eat to cope with uncomfortable feelings. So if Iâ€™m like sad or anxious or awake, I like to be eating to take the edge off.
[audience laughs]
If you still donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s you, you can ask yourself a few questions to find out. Number one. When you eat nachos in public, do you get kinda mad that other people are there to see it? [audience laughs] Do you feel like nachos should come with a privacy curtain? I do. [audience laughs] Have all the best meals of your life taken place in your own car around 11 p.m.? [audience laughs] Under a flickering streetlamp? Have you ever eaten a brownie while you felt okay [audience laughs] and wished you were sadâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦so that it tasted better? [audience laughs] Sounds like more than seven of us. [audience laughs] In therapy, I figured out the day in my childhood I became an emotional eater. I was eight years old and I was eating a bagel in the kitchen and my dad came in and he goes, â€œYouâ€™re gonna want to put that bagel down. I gotta tell you something.â€ And thatâ€™s when he told me that my mom had died. So somewhere in my brain, something clicked, like, â€œOh, when you stop eating bread, [audience laughs] people perish.â€
[audience laughs]
I went back to fourth grade like the angel of death. Everyoneâ€™s like, â€œStep on a crack, break your motherâ€™s back.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œStop eating bread, now your momâ€™s dead, dude.
[audience laughs]
They left out that second part butâ€¦â€ I had a lisp when I was eight. I tell you guys that because no one told me. [audience laughs] They pulled me aside a year later at school. Someoneâ€™s like, â€œTaylor, your teacher thinks you might be struggling with a speech impediment.â€ Iâ€™m like, [with lisp] â€œWhatâ€™s a speech impediment?
[audience laughs]
[with lisp] Are you sure you have the right person, â€™causeâ€¦ Iâ€™m crushing it out there.â€ [audience laughs] And theyâ€™re like, â€œYou didnâ€™t do anything wrong. You just pronounce your words a little differently, like you say â€œshâ€ instead of â€œssâ€ for your Sâ€™s, does that make sense? And I was like, [with lisp] â€œIâ€™m pretty sure I would have noticed [audience laughs] if I said â€˜shâ€™ instead of â€˜shâ€™. Hope you find who youâ€™re looking for. [audience laughs] If you have any follow-up questions, Iâ€™ll be on the see-saw.â€
[audience laughs]
I know dead mom jokes make people uncomfortable. I know that and if you are uncomfortable, I donâ€™t know what to say, you shouldâ€™ve worked harder so it was you up here. [audience laughs, cheers] No, honestly, I never want to make people feel uncomfortable with that information. So much so that I used to lie to everybody. Growing up, I used to tell everybody that my parents were separated so I wouldnâ€™t have to say my momâ€™s dead. And that worked very well until recently a friend of mine found out I had lied and she was very upset.
[audience laughs]
She was like, â€œYour momâ€™s dead? Taylor, you told me your parents were separated.â€ And I was like, â€œWell, they were! [audience laughs] By Jesus.â€ [audience laughs] Both her parents are alive, so she has no idea how funny that is butâ€¦ [audience laughs] Sheâ€™ll get it eventually, right? Like that joke is a slow burn. [audience laughs] Kinda like cancer, which is what got mine, hey oh!
[audience laughs]
Okay, alright. [audience laughs] [groans] Hereâ€™s the deal, Boston. [audience laughs] We have another, like, six minutes of dead mom jokes. [audience laughs] I know. Youâ€™re getting like, â€œWhoa, no, six minutes is a long time.â€ It wonâ€™t feel long. I have cushioned her, alright?
[audience laughs]
I have laid my dead mom to rest in a beautiful casket of dick jokes and pop culture references. Thereâ€™s something for everybody over the next six minutes. Youâ€™ll laugh, youâ€™ll cry, youâ€™ll forget sheâ€™s dead.
[audience laughs]
But I know a lotâ€™s happening for you as a crowd right now because youâ€™re like, â€œTaylor, weâ€™re good people. Good people wouldnâ€™t laugh at dead mom jokes.â€ Iâ€™m here to tell you that if youâ€™re trying to be a good person at a comedy show, youâ€™re wasting your God damn time.
[audience laughs]
Trying to be a good person at a comedy show is like trying to recycle at a theme park. Youâ€™re already in here and part of the problem, put your hands up and have fun.
[audience laughs]
And I know youâ€™re good people. Youâ€™re like, â€œTaylor, weâ€™ve known you for 25 minutes. We hate that anything bad ever happened to you even once.â€ Thank you so much, Boston. But what you have to understand is the bad thing already happened and now Iâ€™m talking about it into a microphone in front of people who paid to be here, [audience laughs] which means now the bad thing is money.
[audience laughs]
Do you think Iâ€™d be this successful at my age if I had a live mom? [audience laughs] [audience whoops] [shouts] Fuck no! [audience laughs] Iâ€™d be a creative writing teacher who loved myself and Iâ€™d be sitting in the dark with you pheasants, okay?
[audience laughs]
Sheâ€™s in heaven, Iâ€™m on Netflix, it all worked out.
[audience cheers]
That is a real thing I said in therapy. [audience laughs] To which my therapist responded, â€œYou should come in twice this week.â€ [audience laughs] Some people get sad because I was eight when it happened. But eight is a great time to lose a parent because youâ€™re so stupid, you barely know whatâ€™s going on. When I was eight, I was like, the only people I know with dead moms are Disney princesses. [audience chuckles] So like, this sucks but am I about to get hot?
[audience laughs]
Then I hit puberty and I was like, â€œOh no, I guess God just hates me right now, thatâ€™s a bummer.â€ Thatâ€™s a joke. God doesnâ€™t hate anybody, alright? Not anymore. [audience laughs] But have you read the Old Testament? Holy shit. [audience laughs] The Old Testament is my favorite Taylor Swift album. It isâ€¦
[audience laughs]
It is banger after banger. Just like, â€œYou donâ€™t believe in me? [in singsong voice] Snakes! Look what you made me do.â€ [audience laughs] Iâ€™m a 20-something white woman, obviously, Iâ€™m gonna compare T. Swift to the Lord, alright?
[audience laughs]
She is the only god I still believe in, alright? [audience cheers] I donâ€™t see God God revamping his old shit and letâ€™s be honest, he probably should â€™cause the people who own it now suck.
[audience laughs, cheers]
It does grow you up very quickly, losing a parent that young. I mean, I saw a dead body when I was eight which means I saw a dead body years before I saw a dick. And that is not the order that shit should go in [audience laughs] according to the American Girl Body book.
[audience laughs]
Although maybe it should be â€™cause you know whatâ€™s crazy? A dick? Way more traumatizing than your dead mom. [audience laughs] Oh my God, itâ€™s so much worse. I saw my mom, I was like, â€œThat lady used to make me snacks, now sheâ€™s very still.â€ I saw a dick for the first time, I was like, â€œOh my God! Who took Jabba the Huttâ€™s eyes?
[audience laughs]
You have done nothing for me. No, no, no. No, I didnâ€™t say Beetlejuice even one time!â€ [audience laughs] I havenâ€™t seen that many dicks and I donâ€™t want to see any more and itâ€™s nothing against men, Iâ€™m attracted to you for some reason but I swear to God, every time you see a new dick, there is an adjustment period, isnâ€™t there?
[audience laughs]
Just a real quick likeâ€¦ [huffs deeply] and weâ€™re back in it, alright. [audience laughs] I have stayed in relationships too long â€™cause I just wasnâ€™t ready to see a fresh one. I just couldnâ€™t [audience laughs] couldnâ€™t wrap my head around it, literally or figuratively. I justâ€¦ I just didnâ€™t have it in me, couldnâ€™t have it in me. Andâ€¦ [audience laughs] I donâ€™t care how many dicks youâ€™ve seen, every time you see a new dick, it feels like jumping into a cold pool. Just like, [nervously] â€œAlright, let me just swim around, get used to this one.â€ â€œOkay, alright, this oneâ€™s deeper than the last one but thatâ€™s okay.â€ â€œThatâ€™s alright. This is why we take our arm floaties, you know, for moments like these.â€
[audience claps, cheers]
[grunting] Just control your breathing, hot girl summer, bitch, you can do it. [audience laughs] I think of the genitalia options available, I think dick seem friendlier, you know. Theyâ€™re up, theyâ€™re happy to see you, theyâ€™re wagging, Iâ€™ve never had sex. [audience laughs] Itâ€™s like a front tail, right?
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™ll Google it, itâ€™s fine. Itâ€™s all speculation. Iâ€™ve never seen a vagina, not even my own, Iâ€™m a Christian. [audience laughs] But from what I hear, it is very spooky down there. Itâ€™s just a dark spooky hole, like, a hole? Iâ€™m sorry, what? Every time someone fingers me, Iâ€™m like, â€œYou are very trusting, sir, becauseâ€¦â€
[audience laughs]
â€œâ€¦I donâ€™t even know where that goes.â€ â€œThat might be where I keep the bipolar. That might beâ€¦â€ [audience laughs] â€œâ€¦where it has beenâ€¦ actually, if you see any, could you scrape it out?â€ â€œCould youâ€¦â€ [audience laughs] â€œâ€¦just like a mental health Pap smear?â€ â€œCan you just doâ€¦â€
[audience laughs]
Donâ€™t do that. Like, you gotta hook your finger, like when a babyâ€™s choking, are you familiar? If you do that, itâ€™ll push it in too far, itâ€™s too late. But if you hook your finger, you swipe it, thatâ€™s how you get it out.
[audience laughs]
I like doing that joke because it goes too far but you do learn something that could save a life.
[audience laughs]
I just love the idea of years from now, someone being like, â€œIf it werenâ€™t for that dick joke, my niece would not be here.â€ [audience laughs] The craziest thing that happened is my mom died of cancer. See? You almost forgot.
[audience laughs]
And then my dad got remarried and then our stepmom got cancer. Sheâ€™s fine, donâ€™t worry. I wouldnâ€™t do that to you twice. [audience laughs] Thatâ€™s God talking to my dad. Andâ€¦ As soon as our stepmom got it, me and my siblings were like, â€œHoly shit.â€ â€œIs Dad giving people cancer?â€ [audience laughs] We thought he was a carcinogen. We were like, â€œDonâ€™t microwave anything for him.â€ [audience laughs] â€œI think thatâ€™s how heâ€™s doing it.â€ If he had taken down a second one, we wouldâ€™ve put a warning on his Christian Mingle account. Like bare minimum, just like, â€œHey, chemicals in here have been known to cause cancer.â€ â€œRide at your own risk.â€
[audience laughs]
I feel like some people donâ€™t believe me that sheâ€™s alive. Sheâ€™s completely fine, you guys. Sheâ€™s happy, healthy, great lady. We actually call my stepmom Mom because when my dad married her, nobody was using it. So we were like, â€œYeah, be Mom, who cares.â€ [audience laughs] Oh, Iâ€™m sorry, if your principal quit and you got a new principal, they wouldnâ€™t be like, â€œThis is Lisa.â€ Likeâ€¦ [audience laughs] Let her be principal, there is an opening.
[audience laughs]
Also, we were so young when it happened and my dad got remarried so fast, I think he was kinda hoping he could just like Indiana Jones switch them out [audience laughs] before anybody noticed. You know when youâ€™re a kid and your hamster dies and your parents donâ€™t want to explain death to you so they just buy you a new one that looks the same and theyâ€™re like, â€œNo, thatâ€™s Connie, she just bites now.â€
[audience laughs]
Thatâ€™s kinda what he did. But with moms. But I never used to talk about any of that, I never used to talk about my mom dying because I didnâ€™t want to make people uncomfortable and also, like most of us with childhood trauma, should be pretty much everyone in here. If youâ€™re sitting here tonight going, â€œI donâ€™t think I have any, I have great parents, I had a good childhood and this â€˜comedy showâ€™? Itâ€™s not that fun for me.â€
[audience laughs]
Good.
[audience laughs]
I hope this is the worst night of your whole life.
[audience laughs]
â€˜Cause it sounds like itâ€™s been smooth sailing [audience laughs] and you might need some perspective. Most of us did have some childhood trauma and when you get to be an adult, youâ€™re like, â€œWoo, made it! Never have to think about that again. Look at all my keys. The worldâ€™s my oyster.â€
[audience laughs]
And so you just start pushing all that dark stuff that happened to you as a kid down, down, down â€™til you donâ€™t even think about it anymore. And that works for a long time. [audience chuckles] Until one day, [audience laughs] you stub your toe really hard on a curb and you just start weeping uncontrollably in the street and youâ€™re like, â€œOkay, this is about something else.
[audience laughs]
I was keeping all my trauma in that toe. [audience laughs] And then I jostled it and now itâ€™s everywhere.
[audience laughs]
[whispering] Gone over here.â€
[audience laughs]
And if you donâ€™t deal with that stuff, itâ€™s gonna keep affecting you in ways you are not even conscious of. I realized in therapy that because my mom died young, I have this irrational belief that I am also going to die young, so Iâ€™ve been living in a very intense unhealthy way my entire adult life where Iâ€™m like, I canâ€™t take a break, I gotta be working all the time, I have to hit these goals and achievements, otherwise Iâ€™m nothing. I got engaged a few years ago â€™cause I was like, â€œI gotta get married before Iâ€™m deadâ€ which is a super hot way to propose to somebody.
[audience laughs]
I call it â€œThe Walk to Remember,â€ itâ€™s kinda my move andâ€¦ [audience claps] It did not work out with my ex-fiancÃ©. I hate that I have to say that word now. It sounds like a spell, doesnâ€™t it? [shouting] Just like, â€œEx-fiancÃ©!â€ Itâ€™s terrible. [audience laughs] He and I are not friends, not â€™cause heâ€™s a bad person, heâ€™s actually a very good person. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve dated someone right before they find out theyâ€™re bipolar but it is what is known as â€œThe Lordâ€™s work.â€
[audience laughs]
I think I was a great partner if nothing went wrong. If nothing went wrong, I was like, awesome. But if one thing went wrong, total nightmare. Like, I was like those spikes you drive over when youâ€™re returning a rental car. Like as long as you keep moving forward, everythingâ€™s great. But if you back up even a little, I will slash all your tires. [audience laughs] And then be like, â€œWhat? I put up a sign.â€ [audience laughs] And youâ€™re like, â€œI know, I mean, I know I messed up a little but like this reaction seems craâ€¦ like other speed bumps donâ€™t react like that.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œThen go be with her!â€
[audience laughs]
[chuckles] We are not friends, my ex-fiancÃ© and I, because I think itâ€™s weird when exes try to be friends with each other and theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™ll hang out, weâ€™ll get fro yo.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œFro yo? I know what you taste like. Iâ€™m not gonna sample yogurt with you, [audience laughs] you psycho. Do they have Kevin after a run, do they have that flavor at Yogurtland?â€ They do, itâ€™s salted caramel, but still. [audience cheers, claps] I went back home after I called off my engagement for whatever holiday doesnâ€™t offend you andâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦a lot of my friends are settling down. Some of them are just settling, period, end of sentence. [audience laughs] You guys know those couples? Everyone knows one couple like that where like one person in the couple is way hotter and cooler than the other person in the couple. I like to call those couples chocolate-covered raisins. [audience laughs] Because youâ€™re like sure, you could put those two together, if you want. [audience laughs] But every time you see them, youâ€™re like, â€œChocolate, what are you doing?
[audience laughs]
You couldâ€™ve been with anybody. You couldâ€™ve been with caramel, you couldâ€™ve been with marshmallow, you couldâ€™ve been with peanut butter, who I heard cures depression, [audience laughs] and you want to be with raisin forever? Like, no offense, raisin, youâ€™re great, we love you, natureâ€™s candy, thatâ€™s you. But you belong with like oatmeal, like, you know that, right? This doesnâ€™t feel good, right? Arenâ€™t you scared every day that someoneâ€™s gonna come along and suck chocolate right off of you?
[audience laughs]
I love this joke â€™cause I like to see couples in the audience looking at each other like, â€œAm I chocolate or raisin? [audience laughs] Weâ€™re both chocolate, right, babe? Weâ€™re chocolate-covered chocolate? Weâ€™re like those little Lindor guys in the foil, you know? Iâ€™m the creamy part and youâ€™re the shell [sobbing] â€™cause youâ€™re so strong and if you leave me, Iâ€™ll be a mess.â€ [audience laughs] Some of you are like, â€œI am oatmeal and I am good with it.â€
[audience laughs]
I made the mistake of talking to my happiest married friend after I called off my engagement, donâ€™t do that. Your happiest married friend doesnâ€™t remember what itâ€™s like to be heartbroken. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWell, what are you gonna do now? Youâ€™re gonna get back out there? Are you seeing anybody?â€ And I was like, â€œNope, just gonna focus on my career for a little bit.â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œWell, why canâ€™t you focus on a career and a relationship at the same time?â€ And I was like, â€œHow do I explain this [audience chuckles] in a way you might understand? [muttering] Why canâ€™t I focus on a career and a relationship? Have you ever been on the freeway in traffic and your lane stops but the one next to you keeps moving, so you get in the one thatâ€™s moving, and as soon as you get in the one thatâ€™s moving, that one stops and the one next to you starts moving again. So you get back in that first one â€™cause that oneâ€™s moving now and as soon as you get back in that first one, that one stops again and the one next to you starts moving. And after you go back and forth a few more times, at a certain point, youâ€™re like, â€œOkay. Is it fucking me?â€
[audience laughs]
And sheâ€™s like, â€œYeah, I donâ€™t know if I get it because you know, John and I, we usually just boop, get in the carpool lane. [audience laughs] And I was like, â€œWhereâ€™s your baby? Imma drop it!â€
[audience laughs]
I actually did get into a new relationship pretty quickly after I called off my engagement. I wasnâ€™t trying to, I really wasnâ€™t. A lot of my friends were like, â€œYou should stay single for a while. You should maybe get a cat.â€ And I was like, hard pass. I have never left an interaction with a cat feeling better about who I was. [audience laughs] Every cat reacts to people the way I react to seeing girls I went to middle school with in a Target. Just likeâ€¦ [audience laughs] [shouts] Oh, no! Like thatâ€™s every cat.
[audience laughs]
I donâ€™t want to come home to that energy. [audience laughs] But I wasnâ€™t looking for a relationship. I was trying to have like a fun, sexy fling which doesnâ€™t usually go great for me because I have this round wholesome face that people think they should build a life with.
[audience laughs]
Every time Iâ€™m like, â€œWe could bone or whatever.â€ Guys are like, â€œNo, Iâ€™m alright but you could meet my mom, do you want to do that? You seem like youâ€™d be better at meeting my mom than having sex.â€ And they are not wrong, alright? [audience laughs] I will meet your mom all night long. Moms like me so much for no reason. I was dating a guy years ago, we were totally on the rocks having problems, and I went to lunch with his mom hoping to get some advice, and halfway through lunch, she puts her hand on my hand and goes, â€œYou know, Taylor, my sonâ€™s a lot like his father. [audience chuckles] And if I could go back in time, [audience laughs] I donâ€™t know that Iâ€™d marry his father again.â€
[audience laughs]
And I was like, â€œAre you saving my life in this Panera Bread right now?â€ [audience laughs] It was like a movie when an older character sacrifices themselves for the good of the journey, like she Gandalfed me. She was like, â€œFly, you fool!â€ [audience laughs] She was a bad mom and a bad wife but such a good friend, oh my God! Hoes before sons, am I right?
[audience laughs]
I think about her every day. And my boyfriend wasnâ€™t looking for a relationship either when we met, straight dudes usually arenâ€™t, you know. Women are surprised when they find a guy who can make them cum and straight dudes are surprised when they find a girl who can make them feel genuine feelings in their heart. Like women are like, â€œHe got me off three times.â€ And guys are like, [in low voice] â€œI mean, I just fucking like her, dude.
[audience laughs]
[in low voice] Like we talked all day, I didnâ€™t want to hit her, it was nuts! [audience laughs] Sheâ€™s just like my friend. I donâ€™t know, I want to like lick her heart, I think.â€
[audience laughs]
Straight dudes are so proud of themselves for falling in love. Itâ€™s really cute. Theyâ€™re like, [in low voice] â€œI love you. Hell yeah, buddy, I knew you could get there.â€ [audience laughs] Women fall in love, weâ€™re like, â€œI love you. [whispering] Fucking again? You dumb bitch. [audience laughs] You were supposed to love you first, you keep skipping that part! [audience laughs] It is eat, pray, then love!
[audience laughs]
Oh my God. Itâ€™s okay, weâ€™ll try again in a year and a half.â€ [audience laughs] My boyfriend is seven years older than me â€™cause I needed to get back on my dad for some stuff. [audience laughs] Older guys are just better. Theyâ€™re just better, you never have to ask them to buy Pepto Bismol, they just have it in the house.
[audience laughs]
They pull it out after dinner like a nightcap, like, â€œYou want some pink juice, baby girl?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œYes, I would, cheers.â€
[audience laughs]
Older guys donâ€™t call you things like â€œcuteâ€ or â€œhot.â€ They call you things like â€œstunning, gorgeous,â€ shit with syllables, things that would take a 20-something guy a little while to settle down. [audience laughs] And older guys arenâ€™t like, cute or hot either. You know, theyâ€™re handsome, distinguished, like old pictures of your grandpa you shouldnâ€™t look at too long.
[audience laughs]
You ever find one of those in an old dusty box? Youâ€™re like, â€œWho is that? Oh, thatâ€™s wrong. Okay.â€ [audience laughs] Theyâ€™re not your family in those pictures yet. Theyâ€™re just the past, it is a gray area. [audience laughs] Oh, Iâ€™ll get weirder. You ever see a picture of your parents when they were young and hot? And you get like weirdly mad â€™cause you know they wouldâ€™ve never dated you? [audience laughs] I saw a picture of my dad in college football once. I didnâ€™t talk to him for three weeks. Iâ€™m like, â€œYou wouldâ€™ve left me at a drive-in, you Danny Zuko piece of shit!â€
[audience laughs]
Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI canâ€™t hug you for a year and I donâ€™t want to talk about it.â€ [audience laughs] Itâ€™s always awkward getting into a new relationship, though, especially right after you called off an engagement because you donâ€™t feel like you can say any cheesy romantic crap ever again. Even if you feel it, you just feel like youâ€™re a jinx. So when the next person is like, â€œI wanna be with you forever.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, wouldnâ€™t that be something?
[audience laughs]
I canâ€™tâ€¦ I canâ€™t use the F-word anymore but I just need to build my credit back up butâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦samesies, bro, for sure.â€ New relationships are awkward â€™cause you gotta tell a whole new person what you like in bed and the only reason you know what you like in bed is â€™cause someone else did it to you first.
[audience laughs]
But you canâ€™t say it like that, right? You gotta do that cute little tap dance of like, â€œOh, babe, you know what would be so fun thatâ€™s never even occurred to me before?â€ â€œYou know what your body is inspiring me to do right now?â€ But in your head, youâ€™re just like, â€œDo it like Craig. Could you justâ€¦â€
[audience laughs]
â€œDo it how Craig did it every time?â€ â€œCraig didnâ€™t do shit right, he did that right, let me tell you.â€ â€œCan we just call him?â€ â€œCan we just call him and ask?â€
[audience laughs]
â€œItâ€™s not a big deal, weâ€™re all adults here.â€ â€œRemember we reset the Wi-Fi router last month?â€ â€œItâ€™s just like that, babe. Heâ€™s just a voice on the phone with the password.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œThatâ€™s all he is to me now.â€ â€œNo, I did block his number when you asked me to, of course I did.â€ â€œBut when you block a number, your phone kinda just saves it in a different folder.â€ [audience laughs] Oh, some of us are gonna fight in the car, not everybody knew that.
[audience laughs]
You have to be able to talk about what you like in bed and you have to know what you can and canâ€™t say, alright? Like Iâ€™ve been telling guys for years I like it a little rougher in bed. I donâ€™t say it like that, I say like, â€œOh, Iâ€™m damaged,â€ you know.
[audience laughs]
If youâ€™re a straight guy, donâ€™t say that. If a straight dudeâ€™s like, [in low voice] â€œIâ€™m damaged,â€ fucking run! That guyâ€¦ that guy wants your toes in a baggy. Soâ€¦ [audience laughs] Sometimes you think you like something and you donâ€™t. I thought I like dirty talk, turns out, I just like dirty phrases we agreed upon earlier.
[audience laughs]
You ever tell someone you like dirty talk and then they hit you with something in bed and youâ€™re like, â€œNah, that was not approved by corporate, no.â€ [audience laughs] I was having sex with a guy once, I was on top and he just went, [shouting] â€œLook at you!â€ [audience laughs] [audience laughs, cheers] Like I was taking my first steps.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™m like, â€œYou better get the camcorder, daddy, â€™cause I am never getting up here again.â€ [audience laughs] My parents donâ€™t watch me do stand-up anymore, donâ€™t worry. [audience laughs] Donâ€™t worry, theyâ€™re not interested. No Christian parents want to watch their daughter talk about depression and dick for an hour. Itâ€™s not fun for them. [audience laughs] My parents donâ€™t have a dark sense of humor and I do, and Iâ€™m glad I do because if you can laugh at the darkest stuff thatâ€™s ever happened to you while itâ€™s still actively happening to you, sometimes thatâ€™s what gets you through it. For example, hereâ€™s a joke they will not like.
[audience laughs]
Did you guys know that sometimes when you call a suicide hotline and the call drops, they do not call you back? [audience laughs] Yeah, you think thatâ€™d be the time for star 69 but sometimes they just ring a bell in the cubicle, like, â€œLost another one, thatâ€™s lunch!â€ [audience laughs] Some of you are tensing up like, â€œDid that really happen?â€ Yeah, a few years ago and it was fucking hilarious. I was on the floor of a DoubleTree Hotel, like, â€œDid this bitch just ghost me while Iâ€™m trying to ghost myself?â€ â€œThat isâ€¦â€ [audience laughs] â€œI mean, Iâ€™ve been left on read, Iâ€™ve never been left for dead.â€ â€œThatâ€™s a new one.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œThat is brutal.â€ I wasnâ€™t even mad. For all I know, thatâ€™s how they train those volunteers. Like, â€œHey, some nights, we get too many calls. [audience laughs] Fridays are big for us, in those situations, youâ€™re just gonna have to use your best judgment, alright? Like I usually wait for like a privileged white girl name, like a Chelsea, a Kelsey, a Taylor. Those are the salmon I throw back and hope they swim upstream on their own.â€
[audience laughs]
Even if I was mad, what am I gonna do, hop on Yelp? Like, â€œOne star, totally killed myself.
[audience laughs]
Youâ€™re gonna wish I killed myself after this review.â€ [audience laughs] I did that joke in Texas a few weeks ago and there was a girl, white, my age in the crowd who goes, [shouting] â€œAnd the wait times are ridiculous!â€
[audience laughs]
And sheâ€™s right, okay? I think, personally, I think if you are a frequent caller, there should be some sort of rewards program. You know, like when you show loyalty to an airline. Like, you should be able to do that with suicide hotlines where you call in and theyâ€™re like, [in robotic voice] â€œPlease enter your rewards number.â€ Boop, boop, boop. â€œWelcome backâ€¦ [sobbing] Taylor.
[audience laughs]
Thank you for your diamond medallion status. You are now third in line. Would you like to use an upgrade and kick someone else out?
[audience laughs]
My parents are still very, very religious. My dad was so religious growing up, he used to insist on praying out loud in restaurants before we ate dinner, which is fine if youâ€™re into that but keep it short.
[audience laughs]
He wouldnâ€™t do that. He would do long, drawn-out prayers full of personal details that none of us signed off on at the table which made puberty pretty rough with your dad in public just like, â€œThank you Lord for this food. Thank you for bringing us here together. [shouting] Thank you that Taylorâ€™s a woman now and is getting the help she needs in math.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œCan you not tell this Chipotle that Iâ€™m bleeding and canâ€™t subtract?
[audience laughs]
I think God knows.â€ Itâ€™s why I donâ€™t feel bad telling jokes about my parents on stage now â€™cause anytime theyâ€™re like, â€œDo you have to air our dirty laundry in front of strangers?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHometown Buffet, 1998. [audience laughs] You told everyone within a five-booth radius that I shat my pants the night before.
[audience laughs]
I can say whatever I want.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™m not religious anymore. I have had some friends find religion as adults recently which is very upsetting.
[inhales deeply]
[audience laughs]
If you grew up religious and youâ€™re not anymore and your adult friends find religion, it feels like God is your shitty ex-boyfriend whoâ€™s now getting it together for your friend and you just have to watch it happen on Facebook. Theyâ€™re like, â€œHave you met God? Heâ€™s amazing.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, I grew up with God, heâ€™s a douchebag, alright? Did he tell you you were broken and you need him? Thatâ€™s his move. Thatâ€™s what he does. [audience laughs] He says that to everybody. Donâ€™t drink what he gives you. You drink that, the next thing you know, youâ€™re eating his body, the holy spiritâ€™s inside you, itâ€™s a whole system they have over at that frat house they call church.
[audience laughs]
Who else uses Roman numerals?â€
[audience laughs]
That joke makes it sound like I resent my religious upbringing and I do, so I nailed it. Butâ€¦
[audience cheers, claps]
No, honestly, if I had to come up with some stuff that was like positive about my growing up religious, Iâ€™m sure I could with enough time and money butâ€¦ [audience laughs] I do have some issues with it. It gave me some serious trust issues and it just made me weird, growing up in church, in ways that I am still discovering. For example, I just found out that I masturbate wrong. [audience laughs] I will back up. Okay, soâ€¦
[audience laughs]
When I was growing up in church, kids had youth group and at youth group, they were like, â€œDonâ€™t have sex.â€ And we were like, â€œFor sure, for sure.â€ And then, they were like, â€œDonâ€™t even masturbate.â€ And all the girls were like, â€œOkay, we didnâ€™t even know that we could.â€ [audience laughs] And all the boys were like, â€œWhy?â€ Andâ€¦
[audience laughs]
â€¦the way they explained it to us was, our youth pastor told us, he goes, â€œItâ€™s not the physical act of masturbating thatâ€™s the sin, you guys, alright? Itâ€™s not even the orgasm. In fact, if you have a wet dream, thank God for the freebie and have an awesome day.
[audience laughs]
But what are you thinking about while youâ€™re doing that to yourself, guys? [scattered laughs] Thatâ€™s what the sin is. Itâ€™s the lust in your heart. Itâ€™s the impure thoughts in your head. That is what the sin is.â€ So when I got to be an adult and I wanted to masturbate, I was like, â€œWell, if I just donâ€™t think about anything,
[audience laughs]
I could probably still go to heaven, right? Just like, clear your mind, get in there, get it done, see you soon, Jesus, right?
[audience laughs]
Touch nothing but the lamb.â€
[audience laughs]
[audience claps, cheers]
So Iâ€™ve been doing this my entire adult life. All my friends are like, â€œYou gotta meditate.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI think I do.â€
[audience laughs]
And I do mean my entire adult life, by the way. I did not masturbate until I was a grown woman. I was that afraid of going to hell, alright? Yeah. I had my first orgasm with my college boyfriend. Do you know how embarrassing that is to get your first orgasm from another person? Thatâ€™s like having a realtor show you your own house.
[audience laughs]
Theyâ€™re like, â€œAnd over here, we have a second bathroom.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œA second bathroom?â€
[audience laughs]
â€œYouâ€™ve been here for 19 years, you never went poking around on your own?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œI did once but I thought Jesus would get mad, [audience laughs] so yeah, I donâ€™t actually own this place, Iâ€™m just renting it from the guy upstairs, andâ€¦ if I flood the basement, I do not get my security deposit back, soâ€¦ [audience laughs] Is there anything else I should see while youâ€™re here?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œYeah, let me show you the doorbell.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, is the doorbell even important?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œThe doorbell is the only thing that matters. [audience laughs, claps] Nobody comes inside without touching the doorbell.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œOh, but I did touch it.â€ â€œYou didnâ€™t use enough pressure, it didnâ€™t light up.â€
[audience laughs]
So Iâ€™ve been masturbating like this my entire adult life and I recently mentioned it to a friend of mine and you ever say something out loud and realize you never should have ever? [audience laughs] I said it so casually over brunch, didnâ€™t even think about it. I was like, â€œOh yeah, I mean, I donâ€™t think about anything while I do that.â€ And she was like, â€œWhat?â€ She put her fork down. â€œWhat? [audience laughs] You donâ€™t think about anything?â€ And I was like, â€œOh, no, I mean, I think some stuff, obviously. And she was like, â€œWhat do you think about?â€ And I was like, â€œOh, you know, just like, â€˜almost there, making good time.â€™ [audience laughs] You know, just like road trip thoughts, likeâ€¦ â€˜keep your hands steady, donâ€™t fall asleep. Canâ€™t wait to get there so I can eat.
[audience laughs]
Better hurry up, Taco Bellâ€™s gonna close, â€˜ you know.â€ [audience laughs] And she was like, â€œThat is so weird, Taylor, why donâ€™t you just watch porn like a normal person?â€ And I was like, â€œUgh, I donâ€™t like porn.â€ Every time I try to watch porn, Iâ€™m just like, â€œYou gotta shave there, too? [audience laughs] Iâ€™m tired and Iâ€™m cold.â€ And Iâ€™m not against porn, okay? Iâ€™m not one of these people thatâ€™s like, â€œIf you watch porn, it will ruin your relationship.â€ I donâ€™t feel that way, alright? I dated a guy once who was really into massage porn where the masseuse would like fuck their client at the end which means sometimes when we had sex, I get a massage! [audience laughs, cheers] Thatâ€™s an example of porn working for you!
[audience laughs]
But my friend was like horrified. She was like, â€œTaylor, this like monk masturbation thing you do, [audience laughs] it is so much creepier and weirder than any porn Iâ€™ve ever seen and Iâ€™ve seen most of it.â€ [audience laughs] And she goes, â€œThere are so many different options porn-wise on the internet now, youâ€¦ just go home and Google â€˜porn for womenâ€™ okay? Just do it, I promise, â€˜porn for women.'â€ And so I went home and I googled porn for women so I wouldnâ€™t be weird at brunch.
[audience laughs]
And a lot of surprising things came up when I googled it. First thing that came up when I googled porn for women was a link to Disney Plus where all the Avengers movies are. Nowâ€¦ [audience laughs] For me, personally, they jump around too much. Thereâ€™s too many storylines. Youâ€™re almost there with Loki and now weâ€™re on Captain America? Itâ€™s like, I have to start over. Thatâ€™s a different speed, a different pressure and now thereâ€™s a raccoon? No. [audience laughs] The second thing that came up when I googled porn for women was a website where real-life couples are uploading amateur sex tapes. Yeah, real-life couples are like, â€œHey, weâ€™re so happy and in love, we thought that we would film ourselves making love and then put it online for you, a lonely person. [audience laughs] Is it working? Are you wet?â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œNot in the right place, no. [audience laughs] But congratulations, what you have seems really special.â€
[audience laughs]
The last thing that came up when I googled porn for women I did not know existed, itâ€™s something called audio porn. Itâ€™s exactly what it sounds like. Thereâ€™s no visual aspect, itâ€™s all audio. Itâ€™s not really a porn star, itâ€™s more like a porn voice actor talking you through a sexy situation. Itâ€™s like a podcast except donâ€™t listen while youâ€™re driving. [audience laughs] And because itâ€™s â€œfor women,â€ that just means thereâ€™s a story, right? Anyone can watch, they donâ€™t check. [audience laughs] They donâ€™t just hop on the mic like, [shouting] â€œNow itâ€™s out, bitch!â€ Like they ease you into it. And so the one I found is 20 minutes long. I will send it to you if you DM me. [audience laughs] And the first 12 minutes, the story, is just a man calming you down [audience laughs] after youâ€™ve been in a car wreck. [audience laughs] That is the foreplay.
[audience laughs]
And you guys, I came so hard. Iâ€¦ [audience laughs, claps] I mean, I didnâ€™t even make it to the sex part. It was the comfort alone. Heâ€™s like, â€œItâ€™s okay, take some deep breaths, donâ€™t worry.â€ â€œThe insurance companies will figure it out.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh my God, thatâ€™s right!â€ [shouting] â€œThatâ€™s why we have insurance!â€ By the time he was like, â€œWhat else can I do? Should I go down on you?â€ I was like, â€œNah, man, I got Allstate, Iâ€™m in good hands.â€
[audience laughs]
Thank you so much, Boston, you were absolutely amazing.
[audience cheers]
Thank you so much. I canâ€™t tell you, I really appreciate you. Thank you.
[upbeat music]
[audience cheers]
You guys were amazing. Thank you so much, seriously.
[audience claps, cheers]

[â€œMaking Love to the Deadâ€ by Beginners plays]
â™ª Darling, go â™ª
â™ª Hey â™ª â™ª Watch your head â™ª â™ª Donâ€™t look down, baby â™ª â™ª Under the bed â™ª â™ª Let it show â™ª â™ª What youâ€™ve readâ€¦ â™ª
[emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Taylor Tomlinson.
[cheering]
Wow! I hope my ex sees this. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for coming. This is amazing. How are you? Good? Okay, Iâ€™m sorry. That was so aggressive. Thereâ€™s so many people. I did not need to single you out that way. I would hate that if someone did it to me. Iâ€™m an introvert. Is anyone else an introvert?
[scattered cheering]
All right. That was a test, and you failed. Uhâ€¦ No introvertâ€™s ever gone â€œwoo!â€ at any decibel. Real introverts are parked outside going, â€œIs it even worth it? I donâ€™t know who she is.â€ Hereâ€™s how much of an introvert I am. Recently, I read a statistic that said, in 80% of homicide cases, the killer was someone the victim knew. When I read that, I was relieved. Like, thank God. I donâ€™t want to get murdered and meet somebody. [groans] Thatâ€™s a lot for a Friday, getting stabbed and acquainted. Just dump me in the river. Donâ€™t introduce yourself, Jeff.
So glad you guys are doing well. Iâ€™m doing okay. I am halfway through my 20s, and I am done with this shit. Oh, my God! Iâ€™m sick of my 20s. Iâ€™m so sick of people telling me to enjoy them. Theyâ€™re not fun. They are ten years of asking yourself, â€œWill I outgrow this, or is it a problem?â€ Like, is this a phase or a demon? I just need to know. Like, am I fun, or should I go to a meeting? Someone help me.
And people get upset when I complain about being young. I had a woman come up to me after a show furious. Sheâ€™s like, â€œYou should appreciate this time of your life â€™cause someday youâ€™re gonna have a family like me, and youâ€™re really gonna miss it.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhere are your kids buried? Holy shit.â€ Iâ€™m just trying to get to my car, Ghost of Christmas Future. If youâ€™re sitting there going, â€œTaylor, you should be grateful. I miss my 20s.â€ No, you donâ€™t. What you miss is a time in your life where you didnâ€™t have a lot of responsibilities because nobody expected anything from you. But do you remember why nobody expected anything from you? Because you sucked. Thatâ€™s what everybody forgets about your 20s. You were garbage. Thinner garbage, but you were garbage. You have no intuition, no instincts. You canâ€™t make decisions, only mistakes. Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re thin in your 20s. You donâ€™t have a gut to listen to yet. Thereâ€™s no mystic bad feeling under your ribs going, â€œHey, maybe donâ€™t date a DJâ€¦ again.â€ Nobody expects me to do shit right. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat can I bring to the potluck, Nana?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œNapkins. Can you handle that? Dry ones this time. And if they say Starbucks on them, I swear to God, Taylorâ€¦ Go to a Dollar Tree. Stop ruining Easter.â€
Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of work on myself. You have to work on yourself in your 20s â€™cause if you donâ€™t, then youâ€™ll turn 30, and all the shitty parts of your personality will solidify, and thatâ€™ll just be who you are now. Your 20s are an opportunity to fish trash out of the lake before it freezes over. Itâ€™s like, ooh, whatâ€™s that? Codependency? Daddy issues? All right. Better get all that out of there â€™cause winter is coming. Iâ€™ve done so much work on myself in the last five years. I quit dating losers. That took a minute.
Yeah. Thank you.
[cheering]
Thank you. Thereâ€™s no rehab for that, only sponsors. Uhâ€¦ Losers are hard to quit. Losers are a lot like cigarettes. You have one in your mouth, you feel pretty cool, but everyone is like, â€œEw! Weâ€™re sad for you. Donâ€™t do that around my kids.â€
All my friends are like, â€œYou need a guy with a car and a job.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œBut then Iâ€™ve got to deal with his wife. Itâ€™s a whole thing.â€
Iâ€™m trying to be a better partner too. I havenâ€™t always been a great partner. I dated one guy, on again, off again, for four years. I would dump him, get back together, dump him, get together. I was the girl you couldnâ€™t bring home for holidays â€™cause what are you going to say at that point? Like, â€œMom, Dad, this is my lesson that I canâ€™t seem to learn. Donâ€™t get attached.â€ He and I broke up because he cheated on me. In my head, and I could notâ€¦ Sorry, if you love me, you wouldnâ€™t even do it up here. Likeâ€¦ You wouldnâ€™t even put yourself in that situation.
I read too many of those â€œsigns heâ€™s cheatingâ€ articles. Have you read those? Theyâ€™re all the same. Like, â€œOh, did he buy you flowers? He feels guilty. Oh, did he call you â€˜babeâ€™? [chuckles] He doesnâ€™t know your name. Was he nice to your family? He slept with your mom.â€
He never cheated on me, but he did do this weird thing where he would let me know any time other women hit on him. Heâ€™d go out of his way to be like, â€œBabe, I just want to let you know, girl at Starbucks tried to give me her number, soâ€¦â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œCool. [chuckles] What do you want me to say? You want me to fist-bump you? Like, â€˜Nice, bro. Get it.â€™ Likeâ€¦ You want me to get jealous? Turn into Batman? Like, â€˜Where is she?â€™ Like, what?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, Iâ€™m trying to be honest with you â€™cause I love you. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™m being honest with you.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, youâ€™re not. You want me to know that you turned down the option of other people today. You want points for not cheating on me.â€ Like Iâ€™m supposed to swoon or something, like, â€œOh, my God, babe. You honored the most basic term of our agreement?â€
[laughter, applause]
â€œIâ€™m so lucky. This is like a fairy tale. I never understood Taylor Swift songs before, and now I do. Likeâ€¦ I thank you so much. I know you have a lot of optionsâ€¦â€ I turned into Southwest Airlines. â€œI know you have a lot of options when you fly. Thank you for choosing us. Can we get you anything else?â€ I was so pissed. â€œDo you have any idea how easy it would be for me to cheat on you? Do you know how many holes I have in me? I take this slice of Swiss cheese for a walk around the block, itâ€™s over for you, dude.â€
[laughter, cheering]
Yeah. â€œI donâ€™t even have to try that hard. Iâ€™ve just got to raise my hand in a Walmart or uncross my legs in a Dennyâ€™s and we are open for business, all right?â€ Just like, â€œBoom! Got your Grand Slam right here, fellas. Line it up. Mama has a point to make.â€
The real reason he and I broke up is the reason everybody breaks up. We were no longer having the amount of sex you need to have in order to ignore everything thatâ€™s wrong with each other. Yeah, love is blind. Lust is Helen Keller. Soâ€¦ We werenâ€™t there anymore, and it got tough because I have a fairly high sex drive. Not crazy high. Not like â€œIâ€™mma catch something at the bus stationâ€ high. But if I love you, diarrhea doesnâ€™t deter me. Weâ€™reâ€¦ Weâ€™re in that zone, you know? Itâ€™s like, â€œYour stomach hurts? Push through it. I want to feel close to you.â€ Mentally push, not physically. Donâ€™t make a mess.
That joke makes me sound so much cooler than I am. Iâ€™m not that cool. Iâ€™ve had sex with two people, four if youâ€™re Christian. Like, Iâ€™m not a good time. Iâ€™m not. I donâ€™t like casual sex. My friends are like, â€œYou donâ€™t know if you like it. Youâ€™ve never tried it.â€ Iâ€™ve also never tried cottage cheese, and I know that shit looks nasty. Itâ€™s all wet and bumpy. I donâ€™t trust it, okay?
I had a friend try to convince me with this argument: â€œYou have to try it, Taylor, because there is nothing as empowering as just banging some guy and leaving.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThat sounds good, but I donâ€™t know. Have you ever tried to make a dudeâ€™s mom love you more than him?â€ That is power. I still talk to Sheila, soâ€¦ Havenâ€™t heard from him in eight years, but every Christmas sheâ€™s like, â€œI miss you.â€
I was very sheltered growing up. I was terrified of sex. I thought I would be bad at it. Now that Iâ€™m older, itâ€™s so easy to be good at sex, isnâ€™t it? All you have to do is approach it with the enthusiasm of a child. Just put everything in your mouth. Likeâ€¦ If you can reach it and it fits, thatâ€™s where it goes. Uhâ€¦ Pretend youâ€™re four and your partnerâ€™s made of LEGOs. Itâ€™s notâ€¦ Itâ€™s not complicated.
I grew up very religious, so I was encouraged to abstain from drugs and alcohol and sex and enjoymentâ€¦ and uhâ€¦ Yeah, being abstinent is when you wait until marriage to have sex. They used to tell us, â€œThe safest sex is no sex.â€ Which is a lot like saying, â€œThe safest travel is books.â€ When I have a daughter, Iâ€™m going to make sure sheâ€™s abstinent in high school and probably before that, while weâ€™re at it, becauseâ€¦ When I was younger and I was abstinent, I was not having sex, but I was having other things done to me, and I donâ€™t know if you know this, but â€œother thingsâ€ are kind of the best part of sex for ladies. So while my friends were having sex, I was the only one having orgasms.
[cheering]
Yeah. I could not believe it when I found out. My friends are like, â€œYeah, me and Chad have had sex, but Iâ€™ve never, you knowâ€¦â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re going to hell and you didnâ€™t even finish? Iâ€™ll pray for you.â€ First time I tried to lose my virginity, I missed. That happen to anybody else in here? Not physically. I wasnâ€™t stupid. I wasnâ€™t like, â€œItâ€™s like trying to put a straw in a Capri Sun.â€ It wasnâ€™t like that. What happened wasâ€¦ I was waiting until marriage, or until Jesus came back, â€™cause Iâ€™m like, â€œMy dad will like him, right?â€ Andâ€¦ I waited, waited, waited. And then, finally, I tried to lose it to my boyfriend in college who said, â€œNo, thank you.â€ Uh, which was a bit of a curve ball. Nobodyâ€¦ Nobody told me to expect sexual rejection as a woman. Nobody prepares you. From the time you start walking as a little girl, theyâ€™re like, â€œHey, everybody wants in there. You gotta build a perimeter and keep everyone out.â€ I was so busy trying to keep people out of me, I never thought Iâ€™d have to talk someone into me. Men take sexual rejection much easier â€™cause theyâ€™re prepared for it. From the time they start walking theyâ€™re like, â€œHey, Brent. Youâ€™re a little creepy. Maybe keep an eye on that. Youâ€™re going to need to get consent, which is a noise she makes, not a feeling you feel.â€ But because men are prepared for it, they bounce back real quick. They walk around like vacuum salesmen. Just like, â€œEh, eh? Thereâ€™s another house over here.â€
My boyfriend was nervous to have sex with a virgin, and I was like, â€œThe good news is, you only have to do it once, and then guess what? Problem solved.â€ I felt like a high schooler trying to get a job at the Gap, just like, â€œWe really want someone with retail experience.â€ â€œWell, how am I supposed to get some unless someone takes a chance on me?â€ I was literally told by somebody that getting rid of my virginity, as a woman, was going to be like handing out free samples at a Costco, and instead, I felt like one of those guys on the Vegas Strip, trying to hand you a nightclub flyer. Itâ€™s like, â€œNo, come on in. Itâ€™ll be fun. Thereâ€™s lights. Itâ€™s kind of damp. Get in here. Ha! Itâ€™s fun.â€
But you know what they say: women go for men like their fathers, so I keep going for guys who do not want to sleep with me. That isâ€¦ so like my dad. All right? No reason to be offended. That jokeâ€™s about what a great dad my dad is.
I lost my virginity late. I lost it when I was financially independent. Yeah. I went through my bank statements. â€œI could afford to have a dick in me.â€ Just, like, so responsible. All my other friends lost it under a Backstreet Boys poster in their momâ€™s house, and I lost it under an IKEA painting that I purchasedâ€¦ with a coupon. But Iâ€™m glad I was raised that way because it taught me how to choose sexual partners in a very responsible way. Okay? So when I was younger and I was waiting, I would tell guys, â€œIâ€™m not ready to have sex yet. Is that okay?â€ Anytime guys were really cool about that decision, that made me want to have sex with them more because there is nothing hotter than someone respecting your boundaries. Youâ€™re just like, â€œWhat? Take your pants off. Get over here.â€ The hottest thing you can say to a girl is, â€œHey, we donâ€™t have to do anything.â€ [breathing heavily] Now we do.
So I still do this as a sexually active adult. I pretend Iâ€™m not ready to have sex with someone new yet, just to make sure theyâ€™re a good person first. I call it the gobstopper test. I go, â€œOoh, Iâ€™m not ready. Is that okay?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œTotally fine. No worries at all.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œCharlie, you won! You did it. I knew you could, my boy! Now, come inside my chocolate factory. Itâ€™s all for you.â€
I am not a casual dater. Hereâ€™s how not casual I am. I actually got engaged this year. Uh, nope. Didnâ€™t work out. Context clues. I would have expected better from you, front row. Itâ€™s okay. Itâ€™s all for the best. Uh, didnâ€™t work out. Just wasnâ€™t the right fit. But man, I learned a lot about myself in the process of getting engaged. First off, I didnâ€™t know what a basic bitch I was, who was gonna love being engaged that much, but something happened when that ring went on my finger. Something in my stupid lady lizard brain wentâ€¦ â€œbloop!â€ â€œLevel completed.â€ I just kind of floated through Target, likeâ€¦ â€œOh, am I better than everybody? Whatâ€™s that? No, I donâ€™t need help. Someone loves me. Iâ€™ll find the towels, right after I cancel therapy. Iâ€™m all fixed.â€ [chuckles]
I wore that ring for two months. I never got used to it. It kept getting caught on stuff, like sweaters and my freedom. It was cumbersome. It also didnâ€™t look right on me. It was a diamond on this. It looked stupid. I looked like a rescue dog in a Gucci sweater. It wasâ€¦ so dumb. I had a friend who goes, â€œAre you afraid youâ€™re going to get mugged?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBitch, I look like I stole it. Are you serious?â€
I knew I was too young to get married because people kept telling me I was. I had so many people that were like, â€œI got married at 25. Donâ€™t know if Iâ€™d do that again.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œArenâ€™t you guys still together?â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œYeah.â€ I had a woman at one of my shows yell at me from the audience. She goes, â€œYou should really wait till youâ€™re 27 to get married.â€ I said, â€œWhy 27?â€ She goes, â€œâ€˜Cause thatâ€™s when your frontal lobe has finished developing in your brain. Thatâ€™s when your brainâ€™s done, 27.â€
Yeah, what a mean fact to yell at someone. Just like, â€œOh, you think youâ€™re happy, Scarecrow? Why donâ€™t you wait a beat till the Wizard gets you a brain? Iâ€™ve been drinking since noon. Make me laugh.â€ But I Googled it, and that fact is real. And that fact is proof that God is a man because who else would finish your boobs years before your brain? Thatâ€™s bullshit. Youâ€™re telling me no one in Heavenâ€™s like, â€œHey, God, are you gonna finish the brain today? You keep putting it off, and it seems important.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œThis is important! [chortling] Donâ€™t tell me how to do my job. Iâ€™m God, damn it! Iâ€™m gonna make one of them bigger for, like, eight years.â€ Iâ€™m sorry if you love God. Thatâ€™s what heâ€™s like.
I did want to be married, though. I wanted to be married. Mostly so I wouldnâ€™t have to date anymore. I will say, though, the best time to date is immediately after a very painful breakup â€™cause your standards are so low. Oh, after I broke off my engagement, I was like, â€œAll I want to do is make out with someone who hasnâ€™t seen me cry in the tub.â€ Like, thatâ€™s all I wanted. I just wanted a fresh one who didnâ€™t know I was crazy, whoâ€™d come in like, â€œYouâ€™re not like other girls.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œMm-mmm, not yet.â€ Youâ€™re sitting across from him at dinner while he talks about his ex. Youâ€™re like, â€œShe sounds nuts.â€ [chuckles] But in your head youâ€™re like, â€œWe would be friends. If this doesnâ€™t work out, Iâ€™ll call her. She made a fake Facebook account to stalk you after you blocked her? Thatâ€™s insane. I would never do thatâ€¦ on Facebook. She sounds old.â€
Iâ€™m not good at dating. I tried a dating app once. I tried OkCupid. Okay, heard some judgment from the back. Look, I didnâ€™t know. I didnâ€™t know it was a bad one. I shouldâ€™ve known. The name sounds like giving up. Just like, â€œOkay, Cupid, you take a stab.â€
I just donâ€™t like dating apps because I feel like people curate these really fake opening lines that theyâ€™ll copy and paste and use on everybody. I talked to a guy who told me on Tinder, his opening line, no matter who it was, was, â€œSo, do you like sunrises or sunsets?â€ Thatâ€™s me choking on his dick â€™cause thatâ€™s a great line. I mean, thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s poetry. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Thatâ€™s a haiku, I think. Check my math, butâ€¦ That lineâ€™s a Trader Joeâ€™s bag. You should reuse it.
I had a guy on OkCupid send me an emoji as an opening line. Not a cute one. Not like a heart or a kissy face, or even an eggplant, which is gross but I get it. He sent me one of these. You know the one you never touch â€™cause it looks like Pac-Man getting a colonoscopy? Half of you wonâ€™t enjoy this joke â€™cause you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about. Thatâ€™s how rarely this emoji is used. I responded. I was like, â€œI gotta make sure this guy doesnâ€™t hurt anybody.â€ So I wrote back and I said, â€œDoes this work for you? Do people respond â€™cause theyâ€™re confused? Are you negging me? Whatâ€™s happening here?â€ He goes, â€œWell, the way a woman responds to the emoji tells me a lot about her character.â€ I said, â€œAll right, Detective Douche Rocket, what does my response tell you about my character?â€ He goes, â€œWell, it tells me youâ€™re really transparent, honesty is super important to you, and you have trouble trusting people.â€ â€œThat emoji works. We should get coffee, or married. I donâ€™t know. Dr. Douche Rocket, Iâ€™m sorry.â€
Iâ€™m not good at dating â€™cause Iâ€™m not fun. Iâ€™m not like a fun person. You can probably tell that by now. For example, this is my impression of a fun person. This is what I think fun looks like. Your creepy uncle trying to corner you at Christmas. â€œYouâ€™re so big now. Letâ€™s dance.â€ I look like something outside a car sale, but itâ€™s just very depressed. Itâ€™s like, â€œYeah, we got Subarus in there. I donâ€™t know. I took a bunch of pills.â€ Iâ€™ve never been fun. Iâ€™ve never been the life of the party. At best, Iâ€™m the faint pulse of a potluck. Like, thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve been able to achieve. I donâ€™t drink. I donâ€™t do drugs. I did start using weed this last year.
You can tell becauseâ€¦ Thank you.
[audience member whoops]
You can tell â€™cause I say â€œusingâ€ like itâ€™s PowerPoint. Wow, I suck. I started taking edibles at night because I was having trouble sleeping. Some of my friends got too excited. Theyâ€™re like, â€œNow we can get high and go see Spider-Man.â€ I was like, â€œOh, no. I only do that at night-night.â€ They were like, â€œYou ruined weed too. How did youâ€¦ do that?â€
I had to start taking something at night because I was having nightmares as an adult, which is like when you get braces at 40. Everybodyâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re still doing that?â€ Like, â€œYeah, I guess.â€ Itâ€™s embarrassing. And nightmares as an adult are so much worse than nightmares as a kid. So much worse. A lot of things are worse as an adult. I think we know that. Have you tried to give yourselves an adult pep talk lately? Yeah, it is laughable. Itâ€™s impossible. You can pep yourself up when youâ€™re a kid â€™cause you still believe in stuff, like Santa and magic and the government. You still thinkâ€¦ there are forces at work for you. So you can shadow box in the bathroom mirror. â€œYouâ€™re going to do it â€™cause youâ€™re great and I believe in you.â€ As an adult, youâ€™re just leaning on that sink, like, â€œYouâ€™re gonna do it â€™cause what other goddamn choice do you have?â€
[laughter, cheering]
You guys tried to buy greeting cards for your family as adults? Canâ€™t do that anymore. Too much has happened. And Hallmark canâ€™t cover it. When youâ€™re a kid, you run into CVS on Fatherâ€™s Day. â€œYouâ€™re the best dad in the whole world.â€ Iâ€™m done. As an adult, you walk down that aisle, like, â€œYouâ€™ve always been there for me.â€ Nope! â€œThank you for accepting me exactly as Iâ€¦â€ Okay, try again. â€œI couldnâ€™t have asked for a betterâ€¦â€ You know what? Screw this. Excuse me. Do you guys have any that just say â€œYou are my dadâ€? How about â€œYou screwed my momâ€? You got any of those? Iâ€™ll get a blank one. Itâ€™s fine. All right. â€œYou are a father. This is a day. Here is a card.â€ Nailed it.
When you have a nightmare as a kid, you can run somewhere for comfort. You can go to your parents, â€œI had a dream there was a werewolf and a vampire, and my hands were snakes.â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œYouâ€™re an idiot! Go back to sleep. None of thatâ€™s real. Why did we have you?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œOkay, awesome.â€
As an adult, you wake up from nightmares. â€œI had a dream there was an earthquake and I got cancer and you cheated on me.â€ Everybodyâ€™s like, â€œOh, yeah, thatâ€™ll probably happen.â€ Theyâ€™re not even dreams. Theyâ€™re just premonitions.
So I started taking these edibles at night, chocolate-covered blueberries, â€™cause if Iâ€™mma be a drug addict, Iâ€™mma have a treat. Andâ€¦ When I started taking them, I was so nervous about becoming a druggie that I would cut them in half and then just nibble on half until I got sleepy. Do you know how afraid of your own personality you have to be to be hunched over one blueberry? The smallest of the fruits. With a plastic knife from Taco Bell. Just like, â€œOoh, be careful. You donâ€™t want to be fun to hang out with.â€
Iâ€™ve never been drunk â€™cause Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m an alcoholic. The only times Iâ€™ve ever wanted to drink are alone in a La Quinta Inn. Iâ€™m told thatâ€™s where youâ€™re not supposed to do it. So I stay away from the stuff. I have been pulled over for drunk driving completely sober, which is a great way to find out that youâ€™re a terrible driver. When cops are stopping you on the highway, like, â€œAre you wasted?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œNo, officer. Thatâ€¦ was my best.â€ That cop didnâ€™t believe me either. He kept hounding me. â€œHow much have you had to drink? How much? How much have you had?â€ Finally I was like, â€œYou donâ€™t understand. â€œIâ€™m not drunk. Iâ€™ve never been drunk. I donâ€™t even know how. Iâ€™m a little sad. Is there a sad driving test?â€ I think they should have one. Like instead of a breathalyzer, they just have you sigh into a harmonica. And if itâ€™s on pitch, theyâ€™re like, â€œOut of the car, Johnny Cash. Canâ€™t have you on the road.â€
But Iâ€™m at a bit of a crossroads in my life, you guys, because Iâ€™m 25, and I donâ€™t want to party, I donâ€™t want to hook up, and I guess Iâ€™m not ready to get married, so what is left for me to do? Judge people. Exactly. Soâ€¦ I was on Facebook this week. Just making sure my family is still racist, andâ€¦ Thatâ€™s a joke. I donâ€™t have to check. Andâ€¦ I saw that a girl I went to high school with just got back from her honeymoon, and she posted that sheâ€™s going to be taking a break from social media. Have you guys seen people do this? Yeah, these heroes of the internet. Their big announcement. â€œHear ye! Hear ye! I will be taking a break from social media, #Brave.â€ Dude, nobody wanted to see a picture of your sandwich on Wednesday. No oneâ€™s gonna miss it on Friday. All right? Also, why are you posting about the fact youâ€™re going to stop posting soon? Thatâ€™s like toasting youâ€™re gonna quit drinking in the morning. Youâ€™re not off to a great start, sweetheart.
This girl made a whole video for Instagram, Facebook, all of them. â€œHey, guys. Suppose you probably heard I just got married. And Iâ€™m going to be taking a little bit of a break from social media, just to focus on my new wifely duties.â€ â€œWifely dutyâ€? Iâ€™m like, â€œYou canâ€™t blow your husband and share cat videos?â€ You have two hands. Multitask. Likeâ€¦ Get an apron. I thought it was weird though, so I played the video backwards. You play it backwards, sheâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™ve made a huge mistake. Come pick me up. Heâ€™s so boring.â€ Weâ€™re like, â€œYeah, we know. We met him.â€ Heâ€™s the type of guy, you get halfway home from the theme park before youâ€™re like, â€œShit! Whereâ€™s Doug? No, we have to go back. My walletâ€™s in his fanny pack, soâ€¦â€ Oh, do not feel bad for Doug. Heâ€™s terrible. Every time he tells a story, somewhere a child loses a balloon.
I went to their wedding. Iâ€™m so glad I did. I learned a lot. If youâ€™re single, go to as many weddings as possible so you can walk around, just like, â€œOkay, not this.â€ We watched her walk down the aisle for what felt like 45 minutes to an hour. Oh, my God. These 20-something brides are really milking that walk. Sheâ€™s likeâ€¦ [whispers] â€œI am a princess.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re Bigfoot. Speed it up. We have lives.â€
I swear, when I get married, Iâ€™m gonna jog a little bit down the aisle, like Iâ€™ve been in a crosswalk too long, just like, â€œI see the numbers going down. Iâ€™mma have you out of here in nine seconds.â€
So she gets about halfway down. Everybodyâ€™s like, â€œSheâ€™s an angel. Sheâ€™s beautiful.â€ She looked okay. Andâ€¦ You ever go to a wedding, like, â€œHuh. Thatâ€™s your best? Interesting.â€ Soâ€¦ Donâ€™t be scared. Let it resonate with you. Soâ€¦ So she gets about halfway down, and I start getting antsy, so I go, â€œIâ€™m going to check out the groom.â€ Usually, at this point in the ceremony, the groomâ€™s crying a little bit because sheâ€™s so beautiful, heâ€™s so lucky, they made a mistake. Whatever it is. Itâ€™s part of the experience, and I wanted my moneyâ€™s worth. Those knives werenâ€™t cheap. So I look towards the front, not expecting, like, a blubbering mess of a man, just, like, a light produce aisle mist. You know? Like a respectful â€œletâ€™s keep those zucchinis dampâ€ type of deal. And he was dry as a bone, you guys. Nothing going on. Just another Tuesday for this asshole. Itâ€™s cheaper to get married on Tuesday, andâ€¦ And I thought to myself, â€œWow. If that happens to me, Iâ€™m going to stop my wedding.â€ â€œYou know what? Cut the music. Cutâ€“ Just cut it real quick. Babe, come here. Weâ€™re just gonnaâ€¦ Justâ€“ I miss him! [giggles] Sidebar. So much fun. You need to get your shit together. I showed up. I have a spray tan. Iâ€™m wearing flavored underwear for you. Yeah, pot roast panties, just like your mom used to make, which is weird. Thatâ€™s a weird request, but I did it. Weâ€™re going to go backâ€“ Donâ€™t look at them. Look at me. Iâ€™m your future. You focus up, buddy. Oh, donâ€™t start crying now. Itâ€™s too late and too early. You save that up â€™cause weâ€™re going to go back out there and weâ€™re going to get it right this time, arenâ€™t we? Yeah, we are â€™cause if you donâ€™tâ€¦ â€˜Cause if you donâ€™tâ€¦ I will make your life a living hell. Do you understand me? I could bake you cookies every day, or I can make you miserable forever. I donâ€™t give a shit either way. I just need a project, motherfucker.â€
[laughter, applause]
But it is feelings like this that indicate I am not ready for marriage. I do want to get married, but I think before you get married, you have to make sure that youâ€™re realistic, okay? About what love and relationships are and can be. Not cynical. Donâ€™t go too far. I mean, I made the mistake of babysitting after I broke off my engagement, and that is not the time to be caring for someone with hope. I was so nervous. Iâ€™m always nervous to babysit. I donâ€™t want to ruin her life â€™cause thatâ€™s her parentsâ€™ job. So I just put on a Disney movie, and I hid in the kitchen, and I thought, â€œWeâ€™ll get through these four hours together.â€ Halfway through the Disney movie, this little girl, sheâ€™s six years old, she comes running up to me in the kitchen, and she goes, â€œTaylorâ€¦ what does being in love feel like?â€ Itâ€™s tough. How do you even begin to explain love to a child that young? How do you begin to explain romance and courtship? Itâ€™s complicated. Thereâ€™s an app. You gotta download it and swipe. Thereâ€™s a wholeâ€¦ rÃ©sumÃ© you have to fill out, take a picture from up here, Facetune it. Thatâ€™s another app, okay?
But I didnâ€™t want to lie to her, and I wanted to relate it to something she would have understood, something she would have experienced in her young life. So I thought about it, and I said, â€œBeing in love is sort of likeâ€¦ Okay. Do you remember when you got lost at the grocery store? That was scary, right? But then do you remember how you felt when you finally found your mom? How safe and happy and relieved you were, and how you ran up to her and you grabbed her leg and then you looked up and it wasnâ€™t your mom? Thatâ€™s kind of what itâ€™s like out here, yeah. [laughs] You think you know somebody. Turns out itâ€™s just some stranger with your momâ€™s knees. Trust no one. Swipe left.â€
So thatâ€™s not good. But you need to be realistic. I have girlfriends that are terrible about this. A friend told me that she thinks the perfect relationship is one where you feel safe, but not bored. Iâ€™m like, â€œBitch, get an Xbox. Thatâ€™s not going to happen.â€ You have to think about what you want and what you need in a relationship because what you want is usually a fantasy, and what you need is whatâ€™s gonna make you truly happy. Same friends. Like, â€œI want Channing Tatum.â€ â€œWell, you need Seth Rogen, soâ€¦ make peace with it.â€
Iâ€™ve been thinking about what I want and need in a partner because I travel all the time. I have a weird job where I work at night. If I want to have a family, what I need is a stay-at-home dad. The problem is, I donâ€™t want someone who, like, plans to be a stay-at-home dad. Those guys who are like, â€œIâ€™d love to be a stay-at-home dad. You just sit on the floor, smoke weed, eat crumbs.â€ That guy sucks. That guy watches your water break and asks you for a ride to the hospital. The only upside to marrying that dude is heâ€™ll never leave the baby in a hot car because he doesnâ€™t have one. I need a guy with goals and drive and ambition, and I need him to give all that up to support mine. I need to find a winner and destroy him. I want to say, â€œThis is my husband. He used to do this.â€
I can feel some people pulling back. Like, â€œTaylor, heâ€™s going to resent you.â€ I know. Iâ€™m kind of into that. Iâ€™m super into it. Iâ€™ve dated dudes that donâ€™t make as much money as me. Almost exclusively. What up! And one of them really hated it, made him feel embarrassed and emasculated, and it wasâ€¦ so hot. Oh, my God. Iâ€™m like, â€œCome here, baby girl. Weâ€™ll role-play. You can be the breadwinner tonight. How does that sound? Yeah, you go right back to making pancakes in the morning. Donâ€™t get cocky just â€™cause Daddy lent you some pants.â€ I have a savings account. That makes me Daddy.
Then I dated a guy who was super fine with the situation. Heâ€™s like, â€œSo you make more money than me? Who cares? Doesnâ€™t matter to me at all.â€ And I was like, â€œWellâ€¦ Okay.â€ And I donâ€™t need you to be upset always. I just want that edge in our relationship. I need you to choke me in bed, but kind of mean it a little. I wantâ€¦ I want that power struggle to keep it hot. I want you to make passive aggressive comments at dinner parties and make all our friends drive home. Like, â€œWhat was that? Are they okay?â€ Sitting in that circle before dinner, drinking wine, like, â€œSo how are you, Bill?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou know, pretty good. Hard to sleep with all these dead dreams under my pillow. [laughs] Am I laughing? Iâ€™ve been practicing. Anywayâ€¦ Iâ€™m just going to get another beer. Honey, do you want anything? I mean, youâ€™ve already taken everything from me. Iâ€™m doing finger guns because I canâ€™t shoot you for real.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œDonâ€™t worry about him, everyone. You know how they are right before they get their allowance.â€
Donâ€™t know why some of you seem offended. Iâ€™m the one who has to die alone. Iâ€™d like to have kids, too, which is a shame because Iâ€™m so talented, andâ€¦ You understand. I donâ€™t know what happened. A few years ago, I was like, â€œYeah, Iâ€™ll get to kids.â€ Now itâ€™s like, every day I wake up and my brain goes, â€œYou have goals.â€ My bodyâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m empty.â€ All the time. I saw a baby in a fedora last week, and I was like, â€œI need to make something and put a hat on it right now.â€ It came from somewhere inside me I didnâ€™t know existed. I felt like a young boy whoâ€™d just seen porn for the first time. Just like, â€œWhatâ€™s happening to my body? I have to go home forever.â€
I do still get annoyed with other peopleâ€™s kids, which I think will keep me empty a little bit longer. My biggest pet peeve are those babies that wave at you from strollers. Have you seen these babies? Theyâ€™re strangers to you, but they wave like you owe them money or something. Like, â€œHi.â€ Donâ€™t engage. Itâ€™s a trap. The same thing happens every time. â€œHi. Hi. Hi.â€ â€œHi, sweetie. How are you?â€ [laughs] You know why they laugh? â€˜Cause they just wasted your time. They know one word. Itâ€™s not a conversation. Thatâ€™s a dead end. That would be like me walking up to a French person like, â€œBonjour.â€ They get excited, talk to me in French, and I goâ€¦ [laughs] Then a bigger person wheels me away in a carriage. â€œAu revoir, asshole. You thought you made a friend. Baguette.â€
I do want to have kids, but I want to make sure before I have them that I have made enough mistakes so that I give great advice as a parent. You have to make mistakes, learn from them, and then you give amazing advice. My dad read his Bible every night, he got a scholarship to college, married my mom, and then had us. His advice was terrible. Heâ€™d be like, â€œDonâ€™t do that.â€ Weâ€™re like, â€œWhy?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know, kid. I read it in a book. Iâ€™ve never really lived.â€ Joel Osteen pose. My uncle was a drug-dealing alcoholic who got shot in the â€™90s. I listen to everything that man says. â€˜Cause he can back it up. Heâ€™s like, â€œDonâ€™t do that.â€ â€œWhy?â€ â€œâ€˜Cause Uncle Larry pees sitting down now. Go play.â€
I donâ€™t want to be one of these people that has kids too soon before I think about what itâ€™s gonna be like. My biggest fear is the technology thing. My kids are always going to have the internet. Donâ€™t get me wrong. Iâ€™m young. I had the internet pretty early. I got the internet as I was going through puberty, which was awesome. I had a magic box I could hop on and be like, isthishairnormal.com. Upload picture. Someone from Arkansas is like, â€œYouâ€™re probably fine.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œCool. Iâ€™m getting back on my bike.â€
I donâ€™t know what people did during puberty before the internet. Just, like, read Judy Blume until they started tingling. Like, what happened? Can you imagine going through puberty in the 1300s? Back then you were alone. Something weird was happening downstairs. â€œThatâ€™s a little strange. Hope Iâ€™m not a witch. I canâ€™t go swimming.â€
My daughter will always have the internet, from the time that she is born to the time she dies. Sheâ€™s always gonna have it. And I have to explain to her that the internet is the most beautiful, amazing, disgusting, horrifying thing in the universe. How do you do that in a balanced, measured way? â€œHey, sweetie. Have fun on the internet, talk to your friends, do your homework, but be careful â€™cause a lot of people on there want to kill you.â€ â€œEveryone on the internet wants to kill me?â€ â€œNot everybody. Some of â€™em are just nice kids from Arkansas who want to let you know your pubic hair is A-OK. Butâ€¦ Yeah, some of them want to wear you like a skin jacket, so just please look out for Mommy. Okay?â€ â€œBut you met Daddy on the internet.â€ â€œThatâ€™s different. I met your daddy on a dating app. He sent me a very thoughtful emoji. And umâ€¦â€
[laughter, applause]
â€œJust really saw me for me.â€ â€œHow did you know Daddy wasnâ€™t a bad internet person who wanted to kill you?â€ â€œLook, you little bitch, I didnâ€™t. Okay? But Mommy was going through a dry spell, your daddy had nice shoulders, so I took a fucking chance.â€
â™ª Tale as old as time â™ª
I donâ€™t want to be somebody who has kids before Iâ€™m ready to have them. I have a friend who told me in the next year, she either wants to get a dog or have a baby. If you think those are the same thing, you are not ready for either one. A dog or a baby? Thatâ€™s like saying, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m either going to get a skateboard or my pilotâ€™s license. Just whatever I have time for.â€
It is insane to me how easy it is to have and keep a baby. Like, if you get your appendix removed, they wonâ€™t let you take it home, but if you have a baby, theyâ€™re like, â€œHere, you dropped this.â€ And you know there are days at the hospital, nurses look at each other like, â€œAre we going to let this happen? They both have neck tattoos. One says â€˜fuck,â€™ one says â€˜babies.â€™ Either way they stand, itâ€™s bad news. Really, this is fine? This is fine with you? What were you gonna name her? â€˜Big Red,â€™ after your truck? Yeah, we got to do something.â€
If you want to adopt a kid, you have to jump through so many hoops, but if you just have one, pft, theyâ€™re like, â€œThatâ€™s yours forever.â€ No questions asked? Thatâ€™s insane. Thereâ€™s no exit interview on the way out the hospital to make sure youâ€™re okay? Just like, â€œHey, before we hand you a baby forever, can you put this metal bowl in the microwave for me?â€
[laughter, applause]
Some of us not clapping. I encourage you to go home and try that. Nobody tell him. I have a friend who has a seven-year-old, and she shouldnâ€™t. And she just bought him an iPhone. Iâ€™m like, â€œFor what?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œItâ€™s for protection.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œGet him a sword. Youâ€™re a terrible mother.â€ I said, â€œDo you punish this little prince?â€ She goes, â€œYes. As a matter of fact, sometimes I will take away that iPhone for a whole week and make him use a flip phone.â€ Yeah. A flip phoneâ€™s a punishment now. All over the United States, there are little kids going, â€œNo! All I can play is Snake.â€
That is not a punishment. You want to hear a real punishment? When I was a kid, I wasnâ€™t allowed to walk to school in the morning with my friends because my dad said Iâ€™d get abducted. But then anytime I forgot to do a chore, he would make me walk home from school alone, as if to say, â€œYou donâ€™t want to do your dishes? We donâ€™t care if you disappear this week.â€ Thatâ€™s a punishment. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m up here. I was trying to understand my friendâ€™s parenting style because I donâ€™t have kids â€™cause Iâ€™m responsible. And I said, â€œHave you thought about alternative punishments?â€ And she goes, â€œLike what?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know. Chores, grounding, spanking.â€ Sheâ€™s likeâ€¦ [gasps] Iâ€™m like, â€œIs he behind me? Did he hear? Where is he? You got eyes on him?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI canâ€™t believe you suggested I spank my child.â€ I said, â€œWhoa, nobody suggested that. I donâ€™t believe in spanking, but I did get spanked, so thereâ€™s a bitter part of me that was like, â€˜Theyâ€™ll not have it better than me,â€™ that I had to work through in therapy. And Iâ€™ve done that work. I wasnâ€™t sure if you had. It was just a question. Also, why are you acting like I invented spanking? I didnâ€™t come in here, like, â€˜You know what would be good?â€™ We both got spanked. What are you talking about?â€
I got spanked growing up. Did you guys get spanked? Yeah. Do you feel fine? I feel fine. Do you feel fine? I feel fine. Do you feel fine? I feel fine. Do you feel fine? I feel fine. If we keep saying it, will we be fine? Maybe. You know, every three years, youâ€™re like, â€œWas I abused? Letâ€™s not ruin Christmas.â€ Have you guys realized your parents messed you up yet? Have you found that stray dent in your head? â€œWhat happened there?â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œWe did our best. Thatâ€™s what happened there. You were slippery, soâ€¦â€
You had this happen as adults: you realize your parents messed you up based on how other people react to stories about your childhood. Stories you thought were fine â€™cause when youâ€™re a kid, youâ€™re stupid. Youâ€™re just like, â€œEverybody gets tied in the yard. [laughs] Happy Fourth of July.â€ Fast forward ten years, youâ€™re at a work party, everyoneâ€™s going around swapping stories, like, â€œYeah, my mom was crazy. She used to make us take our shoes off in the house.â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œOh, my God. I know! We wore muzzles at night. What happened? Whyâ€™d everyone get sad? We could wear them on the carpet. It wasnâ€™t like her thing.â€
But my friend was very offended, and I felt terrible, and I said, â€œIâ€™m very sorry.â€ And she said, â€œYou know what, Taylor? Iâ€™m never going to spank my kid. Our parents shouldnâ€™t have spanked us either. Spanking is the same as hitting.â€ And I was like, â€œOkay, back up. There was a huge difference between what my parents did and hitting. Location, location, location. They never spanked me in the face. Thereâ€™s stuff in my face. People can see that, all right? There was nothing in my butt except justice for my parents.â€ I got spanked so much growing up, I thought thatâ€™s what your butt was for. I thought God made the first kid and was like, â€œIâ€™d better add some fat somewhere in case this starts mouthing off at Olive Garden.â€
Parents are so nice to their kids now. Itâ€™s crazy. I mean, parents apologize to their children. Did you know apologies went that direction? Did you know you could drive backwards on the freeway? Itâ€™s crazy town out there. The closest my parents ever got to apologizing was thisâ€¦ â€œYouâ€™re okay. Youâ€™re all right.â€ â€œYouâ€™re okayâ€ was code for, â€œDonâ€™t call anybody. Letâ€™s just chalk this up to a whoopsie-daisy. I think mistakes were made on both sides. Walk it off. I love you.â€
My friends talk to their children like theyâ€™re human beings. Like theyâ€™re equals. They get down here at eye level. They make eye contact. I didnâ€™t know the color of my fatherâ€™s eyes till I was 22 years old. And thatâ€™s just â€™cause his license fell out of his wallet once. Theyâ€™re down here, like, â€œHey, buddy. Howâ€™s the Lunchable treating you? Good? Awesome. Well, if you have any feedback for me, notes, input of any kind, I would love to hear it. You know why? â€˜Cause itâ€™s your childhood. Iâ€™m just honored to be a part of it.â€ Anybody recognize any part of that speech?
My parents were amazing parents. I love them very much. They did a fantastic job, but they were old-school, tough love, no coddling parents. All right? When I was 15, I told my dad, â€œIâ€™m very depressed. I need a therapist. Iâ€™ve been thinking about killing myself.â€ And he took a knife out of the knife drawer, shook it over his head and went, â€œBe my guest.â€ And I was like, â€œWow! I donâ€™t want you to fix it. I just want you to listen.â€
The best part of that story is, I brought it up to him recently, and he just goes, â€œOh, yeah. I remember that.â€ [laughter] Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, me too, every week in therapy.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œI called your bluff, though, didnâ€™t I? Look whoâ€™s not dead, drama queen.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay. TouchÃ©, big guy. Only on the inside. [stilted laughter] Am I laughing? Iâ€™ve been practicing.â€
Thereâ€™s no healthy fear of your parents anymore. Nobodyâ€™s scared of their parents. I was terrified of my parents. I never talked back to my mom, except for once. She was spanking me in the church parking lot because you gotta get rid of those demons before you enter the house of the Lord. So sheâ€™s cleansing her soul, a little pre-communion, and halfway through, I go, â€œThat didnâ€™t hurt.â€ And she went black in the eyes, and in a voice Iâ€™d never heard, goes, â€œOhâ€¦ Well, then, weâ€™re going to have to make it hurt.â€ And for the rest of my childhood, wooden spoon. She went Martha Stewart on my ass. I still cannot watch the Food Network. Great British Bake Off doesnâ€™t calm me down. But I never talked back again.
You try to spank a kid now, theyâ€™ll laugh in your face. Theyâ€™ll be bent over on the iPhone you pay for, looking up reasons why youâ€™re a dickhead. â€œReally? Youâ€™re going to go through with this, even though Psychology Today says that youâ€™re undermining my well-being long-term? All right, Eileen, you stupid bitch. You do what you got to do.
[laughter]
[woman in audience] Yeah!
Iâ€™ll be down here playing Angry Birds and googling how you live with yourself.â€ By the time I have kids, theyâ€™re gonna be monsters. â€œHow dare you address me directly? Avert your eyes. And get out your boob. Iâ€™m hungry. The big one.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWho gave you an accent?â€
I had amazing parents. I keep saying that in case anyone here knows them. Anyone can come to these. I love my parents. I think if you expect your parents to be perfect, youâ€™re immature. Okay? Parents arenâ€™t these magical, perfect beings. Theyâ€™re just people who suck, like the rest of us. Thatâ€™s how we should introduce them. â€œThese are my people, Rhonda and Tim. They do what they can.â€
My dad was very overprotective. He had four daughters, which means he was just like playing dick goalie andâ€¦ You donâ€™t have to laugh. He hates that joke too. His biggest fear was that one of us would become sexually active before we got married, and, uh, some of us have been activated, so thatâ€™sâ€¦ Canâ€™t take this back to Best Buy. â€œIâ€™ve spilled some stuff on it.â€ On it. In it. The keys donâ€™t work. Itâ€™s over. Soâ€¦
I would hate to be the father of four daughters. It seems very stressful. My younger sisterâ€™s in college. She had lingerie delivered to my parentsâ€™ house once â€™cause sheâ€™s an idiot with an Amazon Prime account. And my dad opened the box because heâ€™s a middle-aged man who pays the mortgage, and if a box comes to his houseâ€¦ thatâ€™s his box. He didnâ€™t talk to anybody about it. He just opened the box, freaked out, and then hid it behind a plant in his room. That was his solution. Just likeâ€¦ [quavering] â€œWell, she canâ€™t have sex without her underwear.â€
I really respect my dad a lot. You know why? He was never a hypocrite. He was just as strict with himself as he always was with us. We found porn on my dadâ€™s computer once, and it was like the porn of a good man. Like, I think he Googled â€œmissionary.â€ Like, I donâ€™t even thinkâ€¦ he was looking for porn. I think he was trying to become a missionary, and he just got lost. The internet just duped him. Heâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s not my wife. Why is she naked?â€ Iâ€™m the only person whoâ€™s ever found porn on their dadâ€™s computer and gained respect for him. It wasnâ€™t even porn. It was just a pop-up.
I know that sounds naÃ¯ve to say, but my dad doesnâ€™t watch porn. He wonâ€™t even watch sex scenes in movies and TV shows. One came on in a theater once, and he marched out like it was a protest. He came back 40 minutes later. I was like, â€œWow, remind me to high-five Mom. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhere were you? You missed half the movie.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWell, weâ€™re not at home. You canâ€™t fast-forward.â€ I was like, â€œYou fast-forward through sex scenes in your own house?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œDamn straight. God is everywhere.â€ And I said, â€œBless your heart. You deserve to see some boobs that youâ€™re not married to every once in a while.â€ So I bought him Game of Thrones on DVD.
[laughter, cheering]
I said, â€œYou canâ€™t fast-forward. Theyâ€™re talking while theyâ€™re naked. Itâ€™s important.â€
Iâ€™m so glad I was raised by my dad. I mean, I think Iâ€™m so much like him. Heâ€™s made me the person I am. Heâ€™s the reason I do stand-up. I donâ€™t watch porn. Not â€™cause Iâ€™m against it. I just never got into it. The same way some adults didnâ€™t read Harry Potter. You missed your letter to Hogwarts. I have a friendâ€¦ hates it. Sheâ€™s like, â€œI hate pornography, Taylor.â€ She calls it â€œpornography,â€ like a loser. And I said, â€œWhy is that?â€ And she goes, â€œBecause it sets unrealistic expectations for men and women. Itâ€™s so unrealistic.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHave you seen porn? Itâ€™s, like, very realistic. Likeâ€¦ Like, they are fucking. I think you saw Star Wars.â€ She goes, â€œNo, Taylor. Itâ€™s unrealistic â€™cause those women arenâ€™t finishing, okay? Theyâ€™re faking it.â€ And I was like, â€œYeah, itâ€™s super realistic. Isnâ€™t that what weâ€™re all doing?â€ Fake it till you make it. Back to your place to finish yourself off. Am I right? Thatâ€™s a joke. Iâ€™ve never faked it. Iâ€™ve never loved someone that much. I donâ€™t hand out trophies for showing up. Grab an orange slice and a Gatorade. Get back down there. Letâ€™s see some hustle, Anderson.
You guys are absolutely amazing. Thank you so much.

[cheers and applause continue]
Crazy will always beat scary. Do you know what I mean by that? Itâ€™s not a great thesis. Itâ€™s not profound, but legitimately, that is the closest I have come to forgiveness in my life. So for most of my life, my mom was a single parent. Five kids. No child support. We were on food stamps. When those ran out, we would dumpster dive for food. A lot of people find it hard to believe that I was ever that poor, â€™cause look at this shit. [laughter] Like, not only do I look like, â€œMeh, everything just, like, worked out.â€ I look like the kind of, like, white, wealthyâ€“ I look like I was conceived in an Ivy League a capella concert. [laughter]
[cheers and applause]
You know what I mean? Where it is, like, thatâ€¦
â™ª Shimmy-doo-wop, my dad owns every university â™ª â™ª Shimmy-doo-wop, what is adversity? â™ª
Itâ€™s not just rich either, right? It is, like, evil rich, right? Itâ€™s like a â€œGame of Thronesâ€ King Joffrey type of rich. It looks like I found a way to monetize human suffering. I run a for-profit private prison, or even worse, I have a YouTube prank channel, where itâ€™s like, uh, they all look like me. Itâ€™s a guy committing, like, a crime on camera. Heâ€™s like, â€œWhat is the prank, bro? Whatâ€™s up? Iâ€™m Tyler, and today, weâ€™re about to steal this old womanâ€™s insulin.â€ [laughter] I grew up very poor in a big family. One summer, my two sisters, they go to this cheerleading day camp thatâ€™s discounted for low-income people, because the woman that runs it is very religious. About five minutes up the road is a boys basketball camp that I really wanted to go to. But because my mom wanted to save that little bit of money, little bit of drive time, she goes, â€œOh. Why donâ€™t you just attend the cheerleading camp with your sisters? Basically the same thing.â€ [laughter] Huh? No, those are two wildly different things. Thatâ€™s like if you were in a restaurant, and you tried to order a Coke, and the server was like, â€œActually, we donâ€™t have Coke, but is it okay if I just frame you for arson? In my head, itâ€™s the same thing.â€ 8 years old, no control over my life, I go to this cheer camp. I was like, you know what Iâ€™ll do? Iâ€™ll just lay low all summer. I wonâ€™t participate in any of the cheers. Iâ€™ll be in the back. Right? Weâ€™ve seen male cheerleaders before. Theyâ€™re like the spotter. Iâ€™ll do that. Turns out, itâ€™s pretty hard to lay low at a cheer camp when you are not only the only boy out of 37 girls, but you are also the smallest of all the girls. [laughter] Why is that important? Smallest girl in every cheer squad is whatâ€™s known as theâ€¦
AUDIENCE: Flyer!
The flyer. So the flyer is the delicate little angel thatâ€™s always getting tossed up in the airâ€¦
[cheers and applause]
â€¦because her delicate, like, bird bones are too dangerous to support anyone and is the safest to be thrown by minors. Unprofessional minors, by the way. This isnâ€™t like Netflix â€œCheerâ€ quality girls. This is day camp quality girls. You know what that means? Day camp? These girls donâ€™t even have the heart and commitment to go to a sleepaway camp. Theyâ€™re just stopping by at 2 p.m. to drop me on a rubber mat thatâ€™s somehow harder than the floor? Do you even want this, Marisa? Because right now youâ€™re trying to make Nationals with a real Regionals attitude.
[laughter and applause]
So the whole time that Iâ€™m beingâ€¦ [panting and gasping] [grunts] â€¦reluctantly tossed in the air, our cheer instructor, Mrs. Schmidt, is yelling at me, â€œSmile! Youâ€™re at the top of a pyramid, not the top of the cross!â€ [laughter] Sheâ€™s very religious. Every time that the girls would drop me, which happenedâ€¦ all of the time, Mrs. Schmidt would have all the girls crowd around me in a semicircle, and they would all start clapping. They would goâ€¦ [chanting] â€œMake noise, make noise. Make nose, make noise.â€ So not a hospital. If anything, just a way to sort of drown out any screams of pain in case the janitor comes by, like, â€œNothing to see here! Business as usual!â€ Roll my body up in a rubber mat and then throw me into a swamp. But eventually I make it to the boys basketball camp because at the end of the summer, the big grand finale for us galsâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦is we get to go up to the boys campâ€“
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So sad!
â€¦and cheer themâ€“So sad.
[laughter and applause]
An adult that knew they were on camera for a taping went, â€œSo sad.â€
[laughter and applause]
Thank you.
[laughter and applause]
Big grand finale for us gals is we get to go up to the boys camp and cheer them on during one of their games. So sad!
[laughter and applause]
Mrs. Schmidt comes to me, and she goes, â€œOh, my God, so youâ€™re gonna laugh.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œFuckinâ€™ try me!â€ [laughter] â€œWe ordered the uniforms at the beginning of the summer before we knew that you were gonna join us. So all we have are skirts. Donâ€™t worry. I wouldnâ€™t do that to you. Why donâ€™t you just bring a pair of blue shorts from home?â€ I have an idea. Why donâ€™t you just kill me right where I stand? So I walk up to this boys basketball camp in blue shorts and a top with a neckline that could only be described as not unisex, low sweeping â€œV,â€ and because of my delicate, little bird bone frame, itâ€™sâ€“itâ€™sâ€“itâ€™s falling off the shoulder. Little tease for the boys. Ahh. Bitch, you wanna see these chocolates? Mnh-mnh! [laughter] We walk up to the boys basketball camp. Before the boys can even take the court for their game, theyâ€™re like, â€œGet up there! Show â€™em what you learned.â€ We start the boys off with probably our most masculine cheer. [chanting] â€œAll right, boys, show us what you got! Show us what you got, boys, show us what you got!â€
[cheers and applause]
[cheers and applause continue]
Now I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever had to cheer someone on as they bully you. [laughter] But itâ€™s a lot like if someone shot you and then it was your job to reload their gun for them. Oh, donâ€™t worry. It gets way worse, section thatâ€™s not that into it.
[laughter and applause]
Fucking halftime rolls around. Now we have a cheer with participation built in. We have the cheer, goes like this. [chanting] â€œWe got spirit! Yes, we do! We got spirit! How â€™bout you?â€ And the boys are supposed to go, â€œYeah!â€ And we go, â€œI canâ€™t hear you!â€ And they go, â€œYeah!â€ even louder. So as the flyer, I have to step right out in front. [chanting] â€œWe got spirit! Yes, we do! We got spirit! How â€™bout you?â€ The boys take this opportunity to yell, â€œYouâ€™re a cheer queer!â€ And then I have to chime back in with, â€œI canâ€™t hear you!â€
[laughter and applause]
[grunts] â€œSmile! Not the cross!â€
[cheers and applause]
I didnâ€™t know how to stand up for myself. I was afraid. I was. I was afraid. I didnâ€™t know how to stand up for myself at cheer camp. A lot of fear comes from being poor. If I was doing a modern-day comedy specialâ€“ you know those ones where itâ€™s likeâ€“ itâ€™s like more like a Ted Talk thanâ€¦ Your friend asks you, like, â€œHey, how was that comedy special? Was it funny?â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œIt wasâ€¦important.â€
[laughter and applause]
If I was doing one of those, I would make the argument that poverty is a disease on the very macro level. â€˜Cause I do believe that poverty is a disease, and its most sinister symptom is fear. Itâ€™s something that I carry with me to this day. If I was doing a modern-day comedy special, Iâ€™d make the argument that yes, poverty is a disease. Itâ€™s passed down generationally just like a disease. Thereâ€™s a lower life expectancy for people born below the poverty line. Itâ€™s no revelation that poverty is a major stressor, and we know that chronic stress causes damage to the cerebral cortex, the part of your brain thatâ€™s in charge of risk/reward, long-term planning. Basically all the tools that would get you out of poverty get damaged by being poor. Trying to dig yourself out of poverty in this country, itâ€™s like trying to fix a scratch on your car by repainting it with a rake. Youâ€™ll be likeâ€¦ [makes squeaking sound] Thatâ€™sâ€“Thatâ€™s the modern-day comedy special. I do not want to do that. I have nothing of educational value to add to your night. You wonâ€™t learn anything. I have legitimately no agenda. I just want to tell you what it feels like to be poor, and what it feels like is fear. How do you create fear in someone? Well, a good way to start is, uh, take away their stability. For most of my life, we lived in a bus. My parents moved us into a bus because I think they were trying to speed up their divorce. If youâ€™re ever, like, with your spouse, and youâ€™re like, â€œThis is taking too long,â€ uh, move into a vehicle. â€˜Cause every time I tell people that we lived in a converted bus growing up, especially in L.A., people are like, â€œOh, my God. Cute. I love that for you.â€ Because I think you are picturing the HGTV version of a bus, where itâ€™s like, uh, itâ€™s like a young couple from Portland. Somethingâ€™s a little off in their relationship, and theyâ€™re always like, â€œHi. Iâ€™m Tracy, and my husband, also named Tracyâ€¦ We fixed up this old bus because we stopped having sex, and large construction projects are the only way that I know how to make the time move.â€
[laughter]
Those are great. Those buses are great. Theyâ€™re built with time, money, and sexual frustration that crushes it into a diamond. The bus that my parents built with no skill, no money, I would love to see an HGTV show Realtor try to sell it. You know those ones that have the kind of plastic surgery where it looks like the wind hurts? â€œAll right, Greg, Donovan, I know you were looking for a 2-bedroom, 2-bath. Instead, I wanna show you this no-bedroom, no-bath, hot diesel tube that has more miles on it than we are currently to the sun. Immediately, youâ€™re gonna notice this diesel smell. Uh, I donâ€™t know how carbon monoxide leaks work. I just know that sometimes youâ€™ll be driving, all the air will get wavy, and youâ€™ll wake up in a new state. Uh, mountains now.â€ This is true. So now I have all this anxiety as an adult, all this fear around waking up and not knowing where I am. [sighs] And I travel a lot for this job. So what I will do is I will say out loud to myself whatever city and state Iâ€™m in before I fall asleep. So a couple days ago, I was in Chicago, and I was like, â€œIâ€™m in Chicago. Iâ€™m in Chicago, Illinois.â€ Okay? Tonight I will say to myself, â€œIâ€™m in Los Angeles. Iâ€™m in Los Angeles, California.â€ Fine. Sometimes I will forget that someone is in the bed with me. I was in Arizona, and I met this young woman after a show, and we had all of the drinks. Alcohol, uh, juice that makes you rude. And I forgot that she was in the bed next to me. So I just say out loud, â€œSedona. Iâ€™m in Sedona, Arizona.â€ [laughter] Very comforting for me. For her, itâ€™s the first act of the horror movie. Iâ€™m on my healing journey. She is on â€œThe First 48.â€ Why does it matter if thereâ€™s fear in poor people? Well, the second you start making decisions out of fear, those are stupid decisions, right? You get backed into a corner, and a lot of times, as a poor person, you have to make those decisions, and weâ€™ve somehow muddled that in our culture to think that, â€œOh, poor people are stupidâ€ because of these decisions. I just recently found out that Iâ€™mâ€“am severely dyslexic and dysgraphic. Uh, itâ€™s a very fancy way to say â€œilliterate.â€ If youâ€™re rich in this country, and you not know read good, then automatically weâ€™re like, â€œOkay, you probably have a learning disability. Letâ€™s look into it. Weâ€™ll get you into a program. Weâ€™ll get you some Adderall,â€ and the parents are like, â€œWhoa, Adderall sounds super dangerous. Isnâ€™t that just like cocaine?â€ And the governmentâ€™s like, â€œNo. Cocaine is bad. Adderall isâ€¦blue.â€
[laughter]
[applause]
And then parents are like, â€œUhâ€¦that sounds good.â€ I guess give it to every child that even breaks eye contact. [laughter] If youâ€™re poor and you not know read good, then weâ€™re just like, â€œOh, yeah, business as usual.â€ People presume that poor people are stupid so often that when a poor person is not stupid, holy shit, well, then itâ€™s like a whole goddamn movie. Itâ€™s like a whole â€œGood Will Huntingâ€ movie where the entire premise is just, â€œAh! Forget aliens in space. Can you imagine a world where this piece of shit that mops the floors understood math? Give it every Oscar.â€
[cheers and applause]
I onlyâ€¦ I only recently found out that Iâ€™m dyslexic. If youâ€™re not familiar with dyslexia, if you havenâ€™t, like, read up on it, donâ€™t worry. Neither have we. All dyslexia really means is that zero percent of the time is the book better than the movie for me. I-I have never had a movie ruin a book. I have had plenty of very confusing books cleared up thanks to dogshit movies. Thank you, â€œPercy Jackson.â€ Thank you, third â€œHarry Potterâ€ movie.
[cheers and applause]
Not onlyâ€¦ Not only did people think I was stupid growing up, but, uh, adults like yourself all the time would come up to me and ask if I was, in fact, a little lady person. I was a very late bloomer. I didnâ€™t really hit puberty untilâ€¦ hopefully next year. [laughter] I was very free with my wrists as a kid, just like two wet American flags in the sun, and I walked on my toes. I walked on my toes for some reason. So in combination, I-Iâ€¦ I walk like how bells sound. [laughter]
[tune of â€œCarol of the Bellsâ€] â™ª Bing-ba-da-bing â™ª â™ª Bing-ba-da-bing, bing-ba-da-bing â™ª
And to make matters even worse, I had this shoulder length long, blond hair. My mom did not know how to cut hair. She was too cheap to pay someone to cut it. So sheâ€™s like, â€œYou know what? Iâ€™ll just make it exactly like my hair but a little bit shorter, and then thatâ€™ll be for boys,â€ and itâ€™s not. It is the Lizzie McGuire. In fact, itâ€™s this right here.
[audience gasps]
Oh, God! Oh, God!
[cheers and applause]
Notice the low swooping necklace to accommodate for the puka shell necklace. Remember when you wanted a meth headâ€™s teeth around your neck? â€œNowâ€¦why is it this glowing, platinum blond? Youâ€™re not blond now.â€ Well, this is true. My mom dyed all five of her kids blond because she didnâ€™t want anyone knowing that she herself was not a natural blonde.
[laughter]
[applause]
Holy shit. Showâ€™s over. Even a serial killer on the run from the law would be like, â€œThatâ€™s too much. Iâ€™ll do the time.â€ Oh. I was talking to my mom about this, just setting up the special, fact-checking everything, and she goes, â€œWell, I didnâ€™t just dye your guysâ€™ hair blond forâ€“forâ€“for my sake. I also dyed it blond because we were about to be evicted from a 1-bedroom apartment, and I wanted to make all you five kids look like one kid.â€ [laughter] [scoffs] Thatâ€™s worse! Thatâ€™s way worse! [scoffs] Never, never defend yourself in court. â€œYour Honor, how could I have committed that hit-and-run when I was across town committing a murder?â€ [laughter] I look so much like a little lady person. I was once kicked out of a menâ€™s restroom. At 13, I was at an Outback Steakhouse with my mom, not to eat but to steal toilet paper. [laughter] I was always too afraid to steal because I saw my mom constantly get caught. She was a terrible shoplifter. And one time she tried to steal bottles of vitamins from a grocery store. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever tried to steal bottles of vitamins before, but itâ€™s a lot like trying to steal maracas. [laughter] Chh-chh! Chh-chh-chh. Chh-chh! And then she would be surprised when she got caught. â€œHow did they know?â€ Iâ€™m gonna guess they were tipped off by the quinceaÃ±era you have going on in your purse.
[cheers and applause]
I was kicked out of a menâ€™s restroom at 13, Outback Steakhouse with my mom. One of the customers comes in right after me, and he goes, â€œWhoa! What are you doing? The womenâ€™s restroom is the next door over, sweetie.â€ Okay. Weâ€™ve all established what I looked like. But also, at this point, I was already standing at the urinal. [laughter] Well, what did he think I was doing? [laughter] [grunting] Try toâ€¦cup it and splash it in? And if I do get it in there, why donâ€™t you let a girl dream? Iâ€™m over here, trying to shatter the porcelain ceiling. [laughter] I definitely know I was supposed to be a rich piece of shit because the thing that bothered me the most was the terms for poor people. So if youâ€™re on food stamps like we were, you were called a â€œfood-insecure household.â€ I never liked that, â€™cause â€œfood-insecureâ€â€“ itâ€¦ [sighs] itâ€™s too emotional of a word. It just makes, like, a pretty serious issue just sound adorable, like itâ€™s in our heads, like the governmentâ€™s like, â€œOh, come on! Show us your food. Show us.â€ And Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [laughter] Mnh-mnh. â€œCome on, showâ€“ go and show us thatâ€¦â€ Look, I need carbs, not confidence. But it makes us feel better if we can make a systemic issue sound psychological, then itâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t have to deal with it. They can just pull themselves up.â€ If youâ€™re on food stamps, they donâ€™t call it â€œfood stampsâ€ anymore. Now itâ€™s called SNAPâ€“ Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. â€œSNAPâ€ just sounds like an off-off-off Broadway production of â€œSTOMP,â€ the musical. â€œCanâ€™t afford brooms. Donâ€™t wanna get sued. So just snap.â€ A woman came up to me after a show who essentially looked like if an NPR tote bag was a person. And she was like, â€œOkay, soâ€“ so you were homeless growing up, but you shouldnâ€™t say that you were homeless. Itâ€™s, like, derogatory. You should say that you were â€˜unhoused.'â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, yeah, sorry I bummed you out with my own personal experience.â€
[laughter and applause]
I think itâ€™s just like itâ€™s these half-measures that we do to make ourselves feel better. â€œUnhousedâ€ doesnâ€™t even make sense. I get that itâ€™s the polite thing to say, but it doesnâ€™t make sense. â€œHomelessâ€ makes sense. We had a home, and then we had less. â€œUnhousedâ€â€“that sounds like another HGTV show. â€œTracy and Tracy realized that the bus wasnâ€™t their problem. The problem was Tracy.â€ â€œIâ€™ve tasted a gun before. I didnâ€™t pull the trigger, but it hit one of my fillings, and I liked it.â€ [laughter] â€œSo now theyâ€™re trying to get unhoused.â€ [laughter] You canâ€™t buy everything you want on food stamps, right? And even when we would buy things that are not, like, food stamp-approved, we would still get the shitty poor person version of it. Anytime we wanted ice cream, my mom would buy us that giant, clear value bucket of ice cream. Did you ever get those? You know what I mean?
[cheers and applause]
Where, like, you read it, itâ€™s like too cheap to even be a real flavor? You read it, itâ€™s like, â€œWe got white, and we got darker white!â€ Whatâ€™s darker white? Is that supposed to be vanilla bean? Why are there pinto beans in there? And this is true. My mom only bought us that ice cream bucket because she wanted the actual bucket. At Walmart, a mopping bucket costs $6.99. Value bucket filled with ice creamâ€“$4.99. It was cheaper than an empty bucket. [laughter] Do you know how shitty your ice cream has to be to actually depreciate the value of an empty bucket? Youâ€™ll be all, â€œI donâ€™t want that bucket if that ice creamâ€™s even touched it. It might ruin my dirty mop water.â€ [laughter] Now the truth about food stamps is itâ€™s a broken system. You pay too much for it as a taxpayer. Also, for the families that are on it, itâ€™s not enough. You always run out of food stamps. So what most families do is they, one, just wonâ€™t eat when they run out, or theyâ€™ll go to a food bank and get the dented cans. [sighs] It isâ€¦ Iâ€™ll get off it, but it did seem suspicious that all of the cans were dented. All of them? Itâ€™s like, are they doing that? Or how are you guys shopping? Youâ€™re like, â€œWhat is this? Low-sodium corn?â€ â€œGet out of here!â€
[laughter and applause]
If you donâ€™t wanna do that, you donâ€™t want the pandering programs, you can take a little agency over your life. Yeah, itâ€™s humiliating, but you can dumpster dive for food. Whatever the grocery store throws out thatâ€™s expired or is about to expire, we would take that andâ€¦ [sighs] I just hated my job dumpster diving. I-I had to be the lookout. I was the smallest, so I couldnâ€™t be in the cool-ass dumpster with my siblings. I had to be the lookout. Like, thatâ€™s the worst job in a heist movie. Iâ€™m not even the lookout for something cool like cash or diamonds. Iâ€™m the lookout for garbage, something weâ€™ve all unanimously decided we do not want to look at. So thereâ€™s no job. Every once in a while, a car would drive by, and then I would just be out front, justâ€¦
[laughter and applause]
The face of dumpster divingâ€“ really, the flyer of dumpster diving. [chanting] E., E. coli, E., E., E. coli!
[cheers and applause]
Thatâ€™s what people wanna know. Thatâ€™s the next question, right? Did we ever get sick eating from the dumpster? Of course. When I was 9 years old, we were living in this really terrible part of Florida called Florida andâ€¦
[laughter] Ha ha, no oneâ€™s ever made that joke before. [laughter] Anytime we wanted to go swimming, we couldnâ€™t afford our own pool, what we would do is we would break into a condo community or an apartment complex, or even a country club in an upscale area, pretend we lived where you live so we could use your pool. Some of you know this as a crime. We were about to break into the nicest pool in Floridaâ€“ Bluewater Bay. Only downside of Bluewater Bay is they had a shit-ton of security to the point where it made me mad how much security there was. There was a guard shack security guard, a roaming security guard, and just a pool security guard. My mom was all about doubling up, not just cheer camp and basketball camp. So she was like, â€œOkay, weâ€™re gonna drive all the way out to this nice neighborhood. First, weâ€™re gonna stop off at their grocery store dumpster, see what these richies are throwing out.â€ [laughter] I had never seen anything like it. This grocery storeâ€™s freezers went down, so they threw out their entire ice cream department at once. Every kind of name-brand non-bucket ice cream is now in three large blue trash bags sitting in this dumpsterâ€“ Hersheyâ€™s, Klondike, whatever the fuck sherbert is supposed to be. My four siblings and I, we waste no time, right there, back of the store, just start shoveling half-melted ice cream into our face as fast as possible, just like little raccoons before this all melts. [laughter] And I feel that judgment from the crowd. â€œGross! Youâ€™re gonna eat dumpster ice cream?â€ Yeah. Itâ€™s ice cream. Do you know how good ice cream is? Ice cream is so good, itâ€™s the only food that all of us in this room will willingly eat out of a strangerâ€™s windowless van.
[laughter and applause]
And weâ€™re excited about it! Oh, yay! Itâ€™s the ice cream man! Send the kids alone! Surely thatâ€™ll be safe. He is only playing the worldâ€™s scariest clown music. Dressed in all white. What kind of pervert dresses in all white? [laughter]
[cheers and applause]
So my four siblings and I waste no time. We polish off three large trash bags of ice cream between the 5 of us in under 15 minutes. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever had to speed-eat dairy in the sun. [laughter] We are not doing well. Have you ever beenâ€“ have you ever been so full that you feel it in your neck? [gulps] Ahh. Itâ€™s like every burp is so high stakes. Everyâ€“Every burp is a contraction for the barf baby that youâ€™re about to deliver. Like, itâ€™s kicking. It has a pulse. Like, if I lived in Texas right now, itâ€™d be illegal to throw this up.
[cheers and applause]
[imitates Southern accent] â€œThat babyâ€™s a person there. Iâ€™ll snitch on you.â€
[applause]
So my mom, thank God, being the one adult in this whole situation, gets a look at us and is like, â€œOkay, you guys do not look well, so pool dayâ€¦ is still definitely on. Iâ€™m not driving back this way again. Rally. Letâ€™s go.â€ I get to this pool. It is packed with other families. So all the security guards are outâ€“ the guard shack security guard, the roaming security guard, and just the pool security guard. My mom is like, â€œOkay, look at me. Look at me. Donâ€™t freak out. Just stick with the regular plan of breaking into one of these pools. Every kid spreads out as far as possible. One by one, you enter the pool from different sides. When itâ€™s safe, you can meet in the middle. Weâ€™re not gonna flash mob people with poverty.â€ [laughter] But the second that I jump in on my side of the pool, I know that Iâ€™m gonna vomit. [laughter] so my plan is to just put my mouth under the water so it wonâ€™t make a sound, and then justâ€¦ [imitates vomiting] Soâ€“So much. It looked like I had eaten nothing but 700 vanilla lava lamps. The amount that came out was just like, oh, my God. I think I figured out how they make darker white. This kid with red hairâ€“ he comes to the surface of the pool, and he goes, â€œOh, my God!â€ Because he has a full IMAX 3-D experience below. That causes my older brother Jonah, who was alreadyâ€¦ [gags] not doing wellâ€“ he turnsâ€“he sees me, and then he starts vomiting. Because vomiting is a lot like those inspirational quotes that white girls will post onlineâ€“ very contagious and embarrassing when it slips out of your mouth in public. So he just startsâ€¦ [gags] â€œIf you canâ€™t handle me at my worst, you donâ€™t deserve me at my best.â€ That triggers my two sisters over here to justâ€¦ [gags] â€œShoot for the moon. You might land amongst the stars.â€ And then finally, my older brother David justâ€¦ [imitates vomiting] â€œIf you want a rainbow, youâ€™re gonna have to put up with some rain.â€ So nowâ€¦
[cheers and applause]
There are five kids simultaneously inspiring the shit out of one pool, which turns out is way too many kids to be throwing up at once. I know that because the other parents at this pool are now freaking the fuck out. Because we are all so far spread out in this pool, it doesnâ€™t look like some isolated incident. In their minds, it looks like some sort of violent supervirus has swept over the entire pool, causing kids to explode. Kids are screaming. Parents are pulling their kids out by the arms. Thereâ€™s kids throwing up that didnâ€™t even eat trash bags of ice cream. Fuck is your excuse?
[cheers and applause]
I get out of the pool. The entire pool is ruined. And I remember just thinking to myself, â€œManâ€¦this place needs better security.â€ [laughter]
[cheers and applause]
I think the common misconception is that everyone on food stamps is just sitting around, waiting to collect a welfare check and ruining pools. In my personal memory, my mom was always in this constant manic state to provide for usâ€“ all these schemes that weâ€™d end up losing more money on, than if she just got a minimum wage job. My earliest memory of this is in 1992, Bob Saget came on TV and introduced a show called â€œAmericaâ€™s Funniest Home Videos.â€ On this show, if youâ€™re familiar, people would send in, like, their amateur tapes of, like, bloopers on a home video. Someone fell down. Someoneâ€™s playing wiffle ball and got hit in the nuts. At the end of the show, the funniest video wouldâ€“ itâ€™s a very exciting show if you havenâ€™t seen it, â€™cause theyâ€“they control the video. Itâ€™s like watching someone else watch YouTube. [laughter] End of the show, the funniest video would win 10 grand. Uh, and then Bob Saget would, like, doâ€“ This is notâ€“this probably wonâ€™t make the special, but just for you guys, umâ€¦ [chuckles] I was rewatching it to, like, prep for this, and for some reason, all of Bob Sagetâ€™s improvâ€“ he would, like, doâ€¦ [nasal voice] Ah. [normal voice] â€¦voices over the clipsâ€“ it was all just about his grandma to the point where Iâ€™m like, like, some kid would get, like, you know, pulled out of frame, like, â€œThis kid got yanked harder than my grandma.â€ Likeâ€¦ Iâ€™m worried aboutâ€“ like, in a real way, Iâ€™m worried about his grandma.
[laughter and applause]
So most people heard this concept of â€œAmericaâ€™s Funniest Home Videos,â€ and they were like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s a fun way to pass the time in between Fentanyl doses.â€ [laughter] My mom heard this, and she took it as a direct and personal job offer. â€œOkay, Bob Saget, I will make you this funny video that you require. You will give me your 10 grand.â€ Every single weekend, we would rent a camera, two 6-hour tapes, and we would shoot fake, staged bits in the hopes of scamming the show out of 10 grand. Usually itâ€™s like a happy accident, like, whoa, hit in the nuts. But my mom was like, â€œNo, we can engineer this. Weâ€™re gonna do highbrow non-nut humor.â€ One day, she gets an idea thatâ€™s gonna win us the 10 grand. Hereâ€™s the bit. All of us kids are gonna be in the kitchen, making cookies, right? And halfway through, 2-year-old Mosesâ€¦ Huhâ€¦is going to accidentally drop an egg off of the countertopâ€“whoopsâ€“ and itâ€™s gonna land on my sisterâ€™s head, who is sitting just below. Judging by this audienceâ€™s response, itâ€™s a killer bit. [laughter] Anyone thatâ€™s silent is going, â€œHow come I didnâ€™t think of that? Egg on the head. Egg on the face.â€ Two things are standing in my momâ€™s way between her and the 10 grand. The first is that her very young children do not understand this bit at all. No concept of, like, a joke, a prank, or pretend. A lot of us do with number two. She was a very strict, religious parent that we were a little afraid of. So when she told my 2-year-old brain, â€œHey, youâ€™re supposed to accidentallyâ€“â€ Oxymoronâ€“ â€œâ€¦drop an egg on your sisterâ€™s head,â€ my brain exploded. I was like, â€œThis is some kind of trap. Why is this being filmed? Youâ€™ve been telling me my entire life not to throw eggs around like we got egg money.â€ [laughter] Soâ€¦ what weâ€™re about to watch right now is the many outtakesâ€¦
[cheers and applause]
â€¦that it took to get this very dumb video, and, uh, before we start it, just a heads up. The video has all the charm and production value of, like, a hostage video. Soâ€¦ I am here in the overalls as she explains this bit to me. [beep] [beep]
Hi!
Hi!
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa.
Weâ€™re gonna make you a video.
Yeah!
Weâ€™re starting off this morning by, um, making you some cookies. [beep] [mixer whirring] No, today on the tape, weâ€™re gonna play, uh, uh, weâ€™dâ€“weâ€™d go outside, and next we wouldâ€“weâ€“ weâ€™d play even whenâ€“ weâ€™dâ€“weâ€™d play outside we have a swing set out there, too. Do it again. Okay. [beep]
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa.
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa. Weâ€™re making a tape today. [mixer whirring] [audience laughing] [beep] [beep]
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa.
Hi! [mixer whirring, speaks indistinctly] Yeah. [beep] [beep] At this point, my mom had come to her senses, like all of us in this room and realized what the problem was. The egg is too small. [laughter] Letâ€™s up the visual stakes with a large bag of flour. So now all they have to do is just knock over a bag of flour. And weâ€™re gonna send it to you in the mail. Okay, honey, doâ€“ okay, do it again. [beep] A little beyond, butâ€“ Oh!
[mixer whirring]
Ow! [beep] Stop, stop.
[beep]
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa! Hi, Grandma and Grandpa! Now weâ€™re gonna send it to you in the mail. [baby cries]
Wait, stop.
Just blown the entire bit. Donâ€™t say that. Weâ€™re acting. Oh. [beep]
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa!
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa!
Hi!
Hi! [mixer whirring, indistinct conversations]
[beep]
Just do it, Moses.
[beep]
[speaks indistinctly] [beep]
[beep]
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa. So Iâ€™ve been recast in the video.
Chocolate chip.
Yeah, chocolate chips. David! [beep] [beep] [faucet runs]
[beep]
Okay, letâ€™s do it.
[beep]
Here we go. Yeah, weâ€™re gonna make you a lot of cookies. [indistinct conversations]
Grandma, Grandma, Grandpa.
You can help. You can help. David. [bleep]
Hi, Grandma and Grandpa!
Hi! We made you some cookies.
Yeah, chocolate chip.
[beep]
David, just do it!
[beep]
Can I help? Can I help?
Yep, we can all help. Let me get you a cup. Damn it. Do it!
Not now.
[beep]
[cheers and applause]
Do it again? [all speak at once]
[beep]
[all shouting at once]
Yeah, flour.
[speaks indistinctly] Ohh! Mommy, that was fast. [giggling]
[cheers and applause]
So now the question is, did we ever win the 10 grand? No. But we did get featured in the cold open of season 3, the very beginning, and for that, we received a $200 appearance fee. So if you add up all the camera rentals, time spent, we made a net profit of
$652, and this is how the clip actually aired on the show with Bob Sagetâ€™s narration over it. Come see why weâ€™re making it. This is what we did. SAGET: These kids cook just like my grandmother used toâ€“ a pinch of this, a bag of that,
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
Nowâ€¦
[cheers and applause]
I only showed you that again because that was a shit-ton of takes to get a very dumb bit, right? It gets way worse. I donâ€™t think you understand how much she believed in this idea. How the clip aired on the showâ€“ sheâ€™s wearing what color pants?
AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: White!
AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Blue!
Sheâ€™s wearing blue pants on the show, but in every take I had shown you before thenâ€“ Will you press â€œplayâ€? Every take I showed you before then, sheâ€™s wearing white pants, meaning thereâ€™s an entirely different reshoot day I donâ€™t even have time to show you tonight. Thatâ€™s how deep this goes.
[cheers and applause]
Itâ€™s very tacky to say how much youâ€™re being paid for your HBO Max special. What I will say is that as of tonight, it took aboutâ€“ well, over 20 years, but eventually, from this bit, my mom made the 10 grand.
[cheers and applause]
A lot of people will watch that video and theyâ€™ll ask me if Iâ€™m mad at my mom. No. The older I get, the more I understand what she was going through. Now that Iâ€™m old enough to have my own kids, and by that, I mean, pregnancy scaresâ€¦ [laughter] I canâ€“I can understand what sheâ€™s going through. Now understanding why someone does a behavior is also not an excuse for that behavior. There isâ€“There is an ocean between apathy and empathy, between approval and just forgiveness. My mom displayed a lot of crazy behavior growing up. That crazy behavior was a way to combat the fear. Crazy beats scary. If your day-to-day problems are the insane decisions that you yourself have created, then you feel like you have some sort of agency over your life. I got myself into this. I can get myself out. And then you donâ€™t have to focus on the larger fear that youâ€™re a single parent, and youâ€™re completely alone. And the older you get, the idea of hustling and grinding starts fading into failure, and you understand that the idea of upward mobility in this countryâ€“itâ€™s a lie. Itâ€™s a lie because stories like mine get elevated in our cultureâ€“ these stories of rags to riches, from the dumpster to HBO Max. Because these storiesâ€“ they make us feel good. These make us feel good. They allow us to continue to do nothing about the unfathomable amount of poverty that is just beyond these walls. And my story is not the truth. The truth is that most people are born poor, and they die even poorer. Sure, I worked my ass off to get here in front of you tonight. But I also got very lucky. I got lucky that people took a chance on me. I got lucky that you physically came out tonight, and I donâ€™t say this because I have any agenda or thereâ€™s any actual steps. I am only saying that I got lucky, because that is what I needed to hear as a poor kid, when I was knee-deep in a dumpster and head high in shameâ€“ â€œSome people get lucky.â€ When I was at cheer camp, and they did a lot worse than just say, â€œHey, youâ€™re a cheer queerâ€â€“ â€œSome people just get lucky.â€ Now imagine youâ€™re a single parent, and youâ€™re not as lucky. Youâ€™re in charge of five human beings that are supposed to have a better life than you. If that doesnâ€™t scare you, I donâ€™t know what will. Crazy beats scary. The crazy behavior was a way to combat fear. The first time I understood that crazy beat scary was on the very literal level. I was 18. I had my very first girlfriend, and Mandy was way out of my league. Mandy was cool. Mandy had these black bangs, thick black eyeliner. She basically looked likeâ€¦ [sighs] like if a person just walked into a Hot Topic, looked around once, and was like, â€œIâ€™ll take it.â€
[laughter]
I, on the other hand, was 18, 85 pounds. I looked like I walked into a Build-A-Bear so I could get a vest in my size. [laughter] And the type of guys that Mandy was used to dating were the type of guys that people would just look at and be like, â€œOh, man, that guy looks dangerous.â€ People would look at me, like, they look at, like, you and I, will be like, â€œOh, man. That guy looks ticklish.â€
[laughter]
I was also a very sensitive teenager. Very sensitive. Mandy was the strong one. I was very sensitive. A couple months before I met Mandy, I was going through a really bad breakup. I was going out with this girl for six months, and we both got to that point in our relationship where we decided that she should break up with me. [laughter] Very confusing time for both of us, â€™cause she was like, â€œWhat are you talking about? We were never actually really together.â€
Iâ€™m like, classic us.
[laughter] I was very chill about the breakup. I cried every single day for 33 days. I know that because I wrote that in a journal, and I sent it to her. [laughter] Emotionally abusive. So I was doing a lot of crying, you know. My older brotherâ€“he caught me crying in our shared room, this breakup, and he goes, verbatim, he goesâ€¦ [scoffs] â€œWow. Guess youâ€™re the worldâ€™s biggest little bitch.â€ I was like, â€œUh, actually, thatâ€™s an oxymoron. How can I be the worldâ€™s biggest and the worldâ€™s liâ€“â€ Before I could finish â€œlittle,â€ he had already punched me in the neck. [laughter] So now anytime I wanted to cry, I would now have to drive to my cry spot. Uh, whoops! That is as lame as it sounds. [scoffs] A designated area I would physically drive my 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse to to just go and cry, save up things that would happen during that week.
[voice breaking] Be like, not now. Save it. File. Save As. â€œSaddest Moment of My Life-Final.â€ â€œFile already exists named â€˜Saddest Moment of My Life-Final.â€™ Do you want to replace?â€ Yes.
[normal voice] And then once a week, drive out to this half-abandoned cul-de-sac, park my car, and unload in this tantrum cry. You ever been crying so hard, youâ€™re, like, about to throw up? Like, your vomit sees your tears come out. Itâ€™s like, â€œMe, too.â€ Iâ€™m that level of likeâ€¦ [moans and gags] I see a cop car speed by the main road. The tires screech out, and it peals back around. Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay, well, thatâ€™s not for me.â€ I mean, shoo-bee-doo-wop, what is adversity? Before I know it, that cop car is now nose to nose with my car. And the cop gets over the loudspeaker, and he goesâ€¦ [sighs] â€œAll right, letâ€™s break it up, lovebirds.â€ [gasps and laughter] I look up. All of my windows are fogged up from my sadness. When I cry, Iâ€™m a squirter. [laughter] But from his perspective, it looks like two human beings are in here, like Ã  la â€œTitanic,â€ like doing sex on each other. So now I have to step out of the car and deliver the worldâ€™s saddest sentence. And he goes, â€œBreak it up, lovebirds.â€ I step out of the car, still crying. Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ [gulps] [voice breaking] â€œNo, itâ€™s just one bird in here.â€
[laughter and applause]
Thereâ€™s justâ€¦one birdâ€¦ in here. [laughter] This very tough veteran cop, like the kind of cop who has seen the worst of the worst over the course of his careerâ€“ homicides, overdoses and heâ€™s kind of tough where it looks like not only has he never let himself have an emotion, but it looks like he buys his jeans at Costco. He gets one look at me crying in his light, and he goesâ€¦ [gasps] â€œOh, God. Sorry.â€
[laughter]
He turns away. Do you know how profoundly lame/white you have to look for a cop to ignore all of his training and turn his back to the perp to be like, â€œI donâ€™t even care if you have a gun. Jesus Christ. Just end it for us bothâ€?
[applause]
Without saying another word, he gets back into his car, and he speeds off, shook, like, visibly shook. I would like to think that later that night, that copâ€“heâ€™s at a diner with all of his veteran cop buddies, exchanging different horror stories. One cop is like, â€œIâ€™ll never forget 2003. 18-car pileup, body parts everywhere.â€ And they finally get to my cop. â€œJohn, you all right? You havenâ€™t said a word all night.â€ And my cop is just in the corner. Heâ€™s in the corner trembling, smoking an unlit cigarette. [laughter] He looks up at them and goes, â€œI didnâ€™t think it was possible, but tonight I met the worldâ€™s biggest little bitch.â€
[laughter and applause]
And then the last copâ€“ the last cop, he goes, â€œOh, you think thatâ€™s bad? Iâ€™ll never forget 1999. Before I joined the force, I was a security guard at a pool, and a violent supervirus swept over.â€
[cheers and applause]
[cheers and applause continue]
Mandy and I did have a lot in common. We both had very strict, religious parents. Like, Mandyâ€™s mom is the kind of religious where as we speak, her bedroom walls are covered in the most gruesome photos of Jesus being crucified. Just likeâ€“orâ€“or paintings. Sorry. Uh, right, not phoâ€“ That would be insane. Thereâ€™s like a watermark. Itâ€™s like, 2008? What the fuck?
[laughter]
Paintings, renderings, and, like, shit thatâ€™s so raw, like Mel Gibson would be like, â€œYikes. That looks anti-Semitic.â€ And hereâ€™s what gets me. Theyâ€™re not even in frames. These photos are just hastily pasted up and down her walls, almost like sheâ€™s trying to solve Jesusâ€™ murder. â€œEveryone thinks itâ€™s Pontius Pilate and Judas, right? Everyone thinks itâ€™s Pontius Pilate and Judas, but no oneâ€“no oneâ€™s talking about John the Baptist!â€
[laughter]
â€œWhy was he in Sedona? Sedona, Arizona.â€ [laughter] So the only place that we could ever hook up was the back seat of my car. Uh, I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever had car sex. Itâ€™s not great. Also, youâ€™re 18. We remember that time with rose-colored glasses, likeâ€¦eh! Itâ€™s the worst sex youâ€™re having of your life.
[laughter]
This is why Iâ€™ve never understood the male fantasy of wanting to hook up with a virgin. I mean it. I donâ€™t get it. Like, why is that good? Thereâ€™ll be those guys thatâ€™ll come to me, and they feel very comfortable saying, â€œI hooked up with this chick. Virgin.â€ Gross. Why is that good? Sex has to be the only time where inexperience is desired. I couldnâ€™t convince you guys to go to a concert tonight and be like, â€œOh, my God. You have to go to the Hollywood Bowl. Thereâ€™s this girl. She hasâ€¦ never played guitar before.â€
[laughter]
â€œSheâ€™s gonna learn as she goes.â€ Like, that sounds awful. Will she at least be enjoying herself? â€œNo, sheâ€™s actually gonna be in a lot of pain.â€
[laughter]
People actually show up to this? â€œActually, most guys will come early.â€
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
I donâ€™t mean to put it on her. I was the worst person that you could lose your virginity to. Iâ€™d stolen my older sisterâ€™s â€œCosmopolitanâ€ magazine. â€œSeven tips to drive your partner wild.â€ Boom, these are going in the arsenal. To drive your partner wild, you are suâ€“ This was what they published. To drive your partner wild, you are supposed to kiss around their jawline as you softly hum.
[laughter]
Soâ€¦
[laughter continues]
â™ª Hmm-mm â™ª
[smooches]
â™ª Mmm-mm â™ª
I did this to a real human woman that I had no intention of murdering.
[laughter]
And we would never park the car in places like Make-out Point in the fear that our parents would catch us. Too obvious. Weâ€™d always go way out to a desolate road or an abandoned parking lot. Itâ€™s a longwinded way to basically say I would take Mandy to my former cry spots. [laughter] Yeah. She was like, â€œHowâ€™d you find this place?â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œNo more questions.â€
[laughter]
I had learned from my crying experience that that these types of locationsâ€“ they draw a lot of attention from the cops. If they see a car parked in the middle of nowhere, theyâ€™re gonna investigate. Theyâ€™re gonna break us up. So it was like, okay, Iâ€™m gonna do something so the cops donâ€™t break us up. I invented this very real thing that Mandy affectionately named â€œjunk blanket.â€ [sighs] Stay with me. I have a replica. Let me show you. Soâ€¦what junk blanket wasâ€¦ [sighs] was an unzipped sleeping bag that I had personally hand-sewn, mostly duct-taped a bunch of old clothes to the outside of. This way, when the cops would pull up on our car and shine the light through the window, I could just pull the junk blanket over Mandy and myself, cop would look through the window and think, â€œOh, thereâ€™s just a pile of junk back thereâ€¦ that happens to be steaming. On with my patrol.â€ So one night, Mandy and I were out in our favorite desolate road. Thereâ€™s not a car in a mile in each direction. Thereâ€™s no streetlights, just the stars. And weâ€™re in the back seat, having the worst sex of our lives.
[laughter]
â™ª Mmm-mm â™ª
Halfway through, 30 seconds inâ€¦
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
â€¦this car pulls up right behind us. Just the headlights are shining through the back window. Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, shit. Thatâ€™s the cops.â€ I pulled junk blanket from the hatchback of my car over Mandy and myself. As the cops get out, theyâ€™re talking to each other, and it starts to sound a lot less like cops and a lot more just like four sketchy guys that mean to do us or this car some kind of harm. I completely freeze in this situation. This is not gonna go well for me, unless thereâ€™s some sort of tickle-off, Iâ€™m not gonna win this fight. The only saving grace is that weâ€™re safe inside the car. They tried to open the driverâ€™s side door. Itâ€™s locked. My heart begins to race. Mandyâ€™s eyes begin to well with tears, makes all that black mascara run. And then itâ€™s completely silent except for the sound of metal scraping on concrete. I peek my head over junk blanket, and just over my head, boom, a metal shovel comes through the driverâ€™s side window, spraying glass everywhere. We are no longer safe. They are inside the car. And it quickly dawns on me that they have no idea that weâ€™re inside the car. They thought the car was abandoned. They were gonna steal the radio, whatever valuables were inside. Junk blanket has worked too well. So now we need to do something. We need to do something just to make our presence known, like, hey, human beings are in here, and Mandy is just looking at me like, â€œArenâ€™t you gonna do something?â€ And Iâ€™m looking at Mandy. â€œArenâ€™t you gonna do something?â€ So I am trying to say to these guys, â€œWhat do you want from us?!â€ [laughter] Butâ€¦I am so scared, the only thing that can come out of my body is this mixture of, like, half breath, half just a fear sound. So now itâ€™s this barely audible, justâ€¦ [breathily] â€œWhat do you want? [mumbling] What do you want from us? [grunts] [mumbling] What do you want from us?â€ And itâ€™s so frustrating. It feels like a bad dream, like your mouth is moving, but no sound is coming out. I need to do something at this point just to make some kind of sound, and I think back to cheer camp.
[laughter]
[chanting weakly] â€œMake noise, make noise.â€ And before I know it, I am outside the vehicle, and I get to look at one of these guys in the face for the first time, and they look more scared than I do. I realize now what they are seeing. My face is now covered in Mandyâ€™s running black mascara. I am butt-naked, except for a baggy green condom, clapping at these guys on a desolate road, going, [muttering] â€œWhat do you want from us?! What do you want from us?! What do you want from us?! What do you want from us?! What the fuck do you want from us?!â€
[cheers and applause]
They are so freaked out. They are so freaked out. They get back in their car, and they speed off, because crazy beats scary!
[loud cheers and applause]
Thank you so much! This is fantastic.
[cheers and applause continue]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
Part two. The reason that we were so poor growing up is my parents were members of an unsuccessful cult.
[laughter]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

<START>
Great. I got a promise I will not be going to jail. Iâ€™ll switch things up now. Letâ€™s see how we do this. Howâ€™s everybody doing tonight? You guys good? Everyone good? [cheers and applause] First of all, thank you so much, Steve. Good evening, Mr President, First Lady, members of the media, and all the men relieved that Ronan Farrow isnâ€™t here tonight. It is my great honor to be speaking tonight at the nationâ€™s most distinguished super-spreader event. No, for real, people, what are we doing here? Letâ€™s be honest. What are we doing? Like, did none of you learn anything from the Gridiron dinner? Nothing, huh? Like, do you read any of your own newspapers? I mean, I expect this from Sean Hannity. But the rest of you? What are you doing here? You guys spent the last two years telling everyone the importance of wearing masks and avoiding large, indoor gatherings. Then the second someone offers you a free dinner, you all turn into Joe Rogan, huh?
I mean, Dr Fauci dropped out. That should have been a pretty big sign. Fauci thought it was too dangerous to come tonight. Pete Davidson thinks itâ€™s okay. And we all went with Pete. Okay. Alright, then.
Now, for those who donâ€™t know me, my name is Trevor Noah, and Iâ€™m really honored to be here, honestly. You know, because you could have picked any comedian. You could have invited anyone, but you went with the South African variant, very on theme. I appreciate that.
And COVID risk aside, can I just say how happy I am that this event is happening again, for the first time in three years. Yeah. And the truth is, I want us all to have a good time tonight. So, please, everyone relax. I know everyone in this room is worried about who catches you laughing at what, but just chill. Just chill. Weâ€™re celebrating. Weâ€™re out. You know? Get comfortable. Not too comfortable, Jeffrey Toobin â€” not too comfortable. No, you know what? No, donâ€™t â€œoohâ€ him, you bunch of haters. You know what? So what, Jeffrey? You made a mistake. You whipped it out in front of your coworkers. Thatâ€™s the first step to winning a Grammy for comedy album of the year. Youâ€™re halfway there, my friend. You donâ€™t let the haters stop you. We all come back from mistakes.
Now, you might have noticed, Iâ€™m gonna be telling some jokes tonight. But I want you to understand. Iâ€™m not here to tear anybody down, okay? Yeah, I might roast you gently, you know, like a pair of testicles on a Tucker Carlson special, but Iâ€™m not doing this just for the attention, alright? Iâ€™m a comedian. Iâ€™m not Kyrsten Sinema, alright? And, by the way, give it up for Kyrsten Sinema. Whoever thought weâ€™d see the day in American politics when a senator could be openly bisexual, but closeted Republican, huh? Thatâ€™s progress. Thatâ€™s progress.
And yes, I know a lot of you are worried, and yes, it is risky making jokes these days. We all saw what happened at the Oscars. Iâ€™ve actually been a little bit worried about tonight. I wonâ€™t lie. What if I make a really mean joke about, like, Kellyanne Conway, and then her husband rushes up on the stage and thanks me?
I just hope we all stay calm, because it is exciting to be here, even though some people donâ€™t think this dinner should even exist, as you said, Mr President, because some people think this shows that the media is too cozy with politicians. But what those people donâ€™t understand is that you guys have integrity. You would never allow personal connections to affect your ability to be good journalists. Isnâ€™t that right, Chris Cuomo? Where is Chris, by the way? Is he here? Couldnâ€™t make it?
Oh, by the way, before we really get going, a few quick announcements. Anyone here who is a Democrat in a swing district, Iâ€™ve been asked to remind you not to hand your rÃ©sumÃ© to the cable-news execs at your table until after the event, please. Thank you very much.
Also, a quick note before people order their Ubers home tonight, Governor Greg Abbott is generously providing free buses for the Telemundo table. Very classy, very classy.
But, man, what a room this is, huh? Look at this room. Everyone is here tonight. Weâ€™ve got politicians. Weâ€™ve got the media. Weâ€™ve got celebrities, basically anyone whoâ€™s been to Jeffrey Epsteinâ€˜s island. This is an exclusive event. In fact, coming in, I heard Meghan McCain telling the bouncer, â€œDo you know who my father was?â€ And they were like, â€œYou have a ticket. You can just come in.â€ But she insisted on telling them who her father was, anyway.
And Iâ€™ll tell you, as somebody coming from Africa, I mean, Iâ€™ve just got to say this is so exciting to be at this swanky party full of Washingtonâ€™s most powerful people. Itâ€™s not as exciting as Madison Cawthorn made it sound, but still very sexy, very, very sexy.
Thereâ€™s many big names here tonight. One of my favorites, Ron DeSantis, is here. Yeah, yeah. Oh, man, Iâ€™m actually surprised that he found the time. Heâ€™s been so busy trying to outmaneuver Trump for 2024. I see you, Ron. I see you, player. Yeah. Iâ€™ve seen what youâ€™ve been doing, blaming Trump for the lockdowns, distancing yourself from the vaccines that Trump created with his own two hands.
[as President Trump] Nobody knew how to make vaccines until I made them, beautiful, beautiful vaccines. Nobody know how, not even Fauci.
[normal voice] But Ron, Ron is playing it coy, man. He wonâ€™t even tell people if he got the booster, yeah. Or as they say in Florida, donâ€™t ask, donâ€™t tell. Am I right? I see you, Ron.
You see, what I like about Ron DeSantis is if Trump was the original Terminator, DeSantis is the T-1000. Youâ€™re smarter than him. Youâ€™re slicker than him. You can walk down ramps, yeah. Because, you see, Trump said he won the election, but everyone was just able to look at the numbers and see that he was wrong. Thatâ€™s why Ron DeSantis is one step ahead. First, you ban the math textbooks, then nobody knows how to count the votes. Boom, my man. Ha ha ha!
What a room. Are you kidding me? The great chef, JosÃ© AndrÃ©s, is joining us here tonight. Give it up for him, people, my good friend in the room. Whenever thereâ€™s a disaster anywhere in the world, Chef JosÃ© is there, which I guess is why heâ€™s sitting at the CNN table tonight.
Now, of course, the real reason that itâ€™s such an honor to be here tonight is that we all get to be in the same room as the most powerful man in the United States. So, letâ€™s give it up for Joe Manchin, everybody. Where is he? Is he there? Good to see you, sir. Good to see you. No, for real, for real, though, Mr President, thank you for being here. Thank you for having me here. I was a little confused about why me, but then I was told that you get your highest approval ratings when a biracial African guy is standing next to you.
[as President Obama] So, let me just say, Joe, Iâ€™m glad that I could do my part and, hopefully, this will work.
[normal voice] Iâ€™m not actually him. I just did the voice.
More importantly, First Lady, Dr Jill Biden, is here, everybody. Give it up for her. Interesting fact, even as First Lady, Dr Biden continued her teaching career. Yeah, the first time a presidential spouse has ever done so, ever. Congratulations. Now, you might think itâ€™s because she loves teaching so much, but itâ€™s actually because sheâ€™s still paying off her student debt. Iâ€™m sorry about that, Jill. Yeah, I guess you should have voted for Bernie.
You know, sir, can I just say? I think everyone will agree that itâ€™s actually nice to, once again, have a president whoâ€™s not afraid to come to the White House Correspondents Dinner and hear jokes about himself. Iâ€™ll be honest. Iâ€™ll be honest. Iâ€™ll be honest. If you didnâ€™t come, I totally would have understood because these people have been so hard on you, which I donâ€™t get. I really donâ€™t. I think ever since youâ€™ve come into office, things are really looking up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Food is up. Everything.
No, it really has been a tough first year for you, Mr President. And, surely, you must be a little worried about 2024. Thereâ€™s a lot of passion on the Republican side. There really is. Itâ€™s going to be an interesting time. And, as you all know, President Bidenâ€™s lack of a filter does get him into hot water sometimes. Last month he caused a huge international incident saying that Vladimir Putin should be removed from power. It was very, very upsetting to Russia. Yeah, until someone explained to them that none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.
But despite some hiccups, President Biden has led the country through some really dark times since he took office â€” the COVID pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the launch of CNN+. And donâ€™t forget. Donâ€™t forget. Donâ€™t forget. Heâ€™s also had some major legislative successes in his first year in office, I might add. He got a bipartisan infrastructure bill passed that would do everything from fixing Americaâ€™s roads and bridges to modernizing school buses, which Matt Gaetzâ€˜s girlfriend is very excited about. Donâ€™t boo love!
Not to mention, no President in my memory has given more marginalized groups opportunities. Iâ€™m talking about women, the LGBTQ community, the Taliban â€” the list goes on and on. And I know, Mr President, that the left is super upset at you, but I think that they should be happy to know that you just recently announced that youâ€™re proposing a new 20% minimum tax on the super wealthy. And I will say, President Biden, that you are a big man here, a really big man. You could have targeted Donald Trump, but instead you chose to only raise taxes on billionaires. That was big of you. Really nice. Prove me wrong. Show me the taxes.
So, personally, I think that President Biden could do a better job of taking credit for the things that are going right. Unemployment is currently at 3(point)6%. Think about that, people, 3(point)6%. 2% if you donâ€™t count the Cuomo family. And I will say, President Biden came into office and heâ€™s done well and heâ€™s done badly. And in this room, I know thereâ€™s a lot of mixed reviews. There was a lot of talk about how the President really respects the press, but what has he really done for you guys, huh? Think of all the journalists whose careers have been hurt by the Biden presidency.
People like Daniel Dale. Used to be CNNâ€™s star fact checker, on TV every day. But now thereâ€™s barely anything to check.
Same for Glen Kessler of The Washington Post. On the way here, I saw him on the street offering four Pinocchios for a dollar. Mr President, thatâ€™s on you.
And what about Maggie Haberman? For four years, it was exclusives, huh? On the Russia investigation, corruption. The President doesnâ€™t read his daily briefings â€” on and on. Now look at her! She spends all day fighting with random people on Twitter like a common political reporter. Youâ€™ve ruined her, Mr President.
Now, of course, President Biden doesnâ€™t often have to deal with the media directly. Yes. That task falls to Press Secretary Jen Psaki. Yes. Glad you could make it tonight. Really glad you could make it tonight, Jen. Itâ€™s nice that youâ€™re willing to come over here and risk getting COVID for like, what, the 10th time now? Let me ask, how do you keep getting COVID, Jen? Your boss hooked us all up with free tests. Does he not have your address? Whatâ€™s going on there?
The word on the streets is actually that Jen Psaki is going to MSNBC next month. Yeah, yeah. Apparently, just being on C-SPAN, the ratings were too high, and she wanted more of a challenge. Wanted to switch things up. She canâ€™t laugh at that. Donâ€™t put the camera on her. If itâ€™s true, congratulations to Jen on your big career change. But moving to MSNBC is going to be a big switch up for you because right now your current job is to make the Biden administration look as good as possible at all costs. Now youâ€™re going to be at MSNBC and youâ€™re going to have to, um â€” youâ€™ll be fine, actually. Sorry. I donâ€™t even know why I apologize.
By the way, MSNBC, can I just say you guys are doing great work? You know? I love watching your shows. When Trump was in office, your shows were all about how bad he was. And now that Bidenâ€™s in office, your shows are all about how bad Trump was. Consistency is important. We appreciate that. We really do.
Also, shout out to Joe and Mika. Yeah, I love you guys. Most adorable HR violation in town. I love it. So adorable. What?
And thatâ€™s why weâ€™re really here, people. Weâ€™re here to honor the media. Yeah. So, first and foremost, letâ€™s give it up for the White House press pool. Letâ€™s give it up for them, please. You guys are relentless. Every day you show up, and every day you demand answers on the pressing issues of the day. And then Fox News asks about Hunter Biden. And Iâ€™ll be honest, though. I actually think thatâ€™s a good thing. I really do. I think people need to be held accountable if theyâ€™re using their dadâ€™s name to get ahead in life. And I canâ€™t think of anyone better to ask about that than Peter Doocy. Yeah. Wherever he is. Chris Wallace laughed at that joke.
But you see the real purpose of tonight is to honor some of the countryâ€™s best political journalists, people like Abby Phillip, Yamiche Alcindor. Right? And Mick Mulvaney. I actually get why CBS hired Mick Mulvaney. I get it. Heâ€™s more than just the guy who assured everyone that Donald Trump would concede gracefully. No, he can also get you access to other people who assured you that Donald Trump would concede very gracefully. Itâ€™s very important. So, shout-out to CBS, my corporate cousin. You can actually find us on Paramount Plus. Yes. Right between â€œSpongeBob SquarePantsâ€ and a bunch of movies that even Deltaâ€™s in-flight entertainment system turned down.
But I donâ€™t want to dwell on that. I donâ€™t want to dwell on Mick Mulvaney, when we have so many other great journalists here tonight. We got Anderson Cooper in the house, man. We got Rachel Maddow. We got Don Lemon. We got Shepherd Smith and so many other huge talents who can no longer be mentioned in Florida public schools. I see you Ron DeSantis! Whatâ€™s going on, baby?
Oh, man. A lot of big media names in the room tonight. Chuck Todd is here. Chuck, you here? Yeah. How you doing? Iâ€™d ask a follow-up, but I know you donâ€™t know what those are. Donâ€™t boo him. Heâ€™s trying. Man, these people are mean, Chuck.
The Axios team is also in the house. I didnâ€™t know this, but â€œAxiosâ€ is actually Greek for political playbook without the birthdays. Yeah. And Axios got a lot of flack a few years ago for releasing a staff photo that had fewer black people in it than CPAC, but kudos to Axios. They fixed that problem by not releasing any more staff photos. And Jonathan Swan, my man. Iâ€™m a fan, personal fan. Youâ€™ve been crushing it with those interviews. Congrats on the award. People are always asking, â€œHow does Jonathan Swan get these politicians to open up to him?â€ Iâ€™ll tell you how. Itâ€™s the Australian accent. Yeah. American journalists sound too aggressive. â€œWhat did you do with the money? !â€ An interview with Jonathan Swan is like being interrogated by a koala bear.
[as Jonathan Swan] But, Senator McConnell, donâ€™t you think itâ€™s strange that you and the devil have never been seen in the same place at the same time? Donâ€™t you think thatâ€™s strange?
[as Senator McConnell] Well, I guess when you go to hell, youâ€™ll find out for yourselves.
[normal voice] NPR is here tonight, one of my favorites. Congratulations on all the work you do. I love Tiny Desk Concerts. I just wish you guys didnâ€™t always have to beg for money. Maybe youâ€™re spending too much on those tote bags. Who designs those? House of Gucci? Why donâ€™t just ask Ivanka which kids make her stuff? Come on.
And how about The New York Times? Also here. Man, can I just say, New York Times, I did not realize how much you guys like to party. Yeah. Iâ€™ve seen some of you sneaking off to the bathroom to do things youâ€™re not supposed to do tonight, like post on Twitter. Yeah, Iâ€™ve seen that.
I love The New York Times. I really do. You guys are the best. You do some of the most accurate, precise reporting in news. You never fail to write down exactly whatever the police have given you to say. Really powerful. Is it just me, or does The New York Times keep blaming bail reform on crimes that had nothing to do with bail reform? Iâ€™m half expecting to open your newspaper and see a headline â€œMets blow 4-run lead due to changes in state bail laws.â€
And itâ€™s actually crazy how you guys have been attacked for everything, from your investigations into Trumpâ€™s taxes, to your reporting on the pandemic. And yet the biggest death threats that you received is because there were two Lâ€™s in the Wordle that day. That was wild.
By the way, give it up to those New York Times reporters who managed to get those Kevin McCarthy tapes. That was amazing. Yeah. Give it up for them. Incredible. You knew how crucial those tapes were, which is why you immediately waited until your book was for sale to tell the people about them. Bravo. Bravo. And you know what I liked about those tapes is that the one piece of good news is that now we know whether Nancy Pelosi or Kevin McCarthy are speaker of the house, that position will still be held by someone who believes that Trump should have resigned and was responsible for what happened on January 6th. Yeah. Thatâ€™s bipartisanship. I like that.
Iâ€™m really excited because the kings of cable are here. Fox News in the house. Yeah. The top-rated news network for the past, what, 300 years? Killing it. And I know Fox has a bad reputation. I even feel you tense up now when I talk about them. They really do crush it. I think they get a bad rap because itâ€™s a mixed bag. They actually have really good journalists. It just depends on when you watch. Right? Fox News is sort of like a Waffle House. Yeah. Itâ€™s relatively normal in the afternoon, but as soon as the sun goes down, thereâ€™s a drunk lady named Jeanine threatening to fight every Mexican who comes in.
[as Jeanine Pirro] You canâ€™t throw me out. I know the real president!
[normal voice] How about that Fox prime-time lineup, huh? Tucker Carlson. Sean Hannity. Laura Ingraham. Their coverage of COVID was really impactful. Their segments about vaccines moved their viewers into the ICU. And congrats. Congrats to Sean Hannity on becoming the longest-running host in cable-news history, by the way. Give it up for him. For real, give it up for him. Longest-running host. Donâ€™t hate. Donâ€™t hate the player. Yeah.
Fun fact. Sean Hannity and Ainsley Earhardt are actually dating now. Yes. Yeah. And I actually think itâ€™s beautiful to see an office romance at Fox that wonâ€™t end in a $20 million settlement. Yeah. Iâ€™m sure wherever Roger Ailes is right now, heâ€™s looking up and smiling.
Oh, Laura Ingraham, wow! What can you say about her that hasnâ€™t already been said by the Anti-Defamation League? Powerful.
Iâ€™m just sad that Tucker Carlson isnâ€™t here today. Heâ€™s my favorite. What a talent. Tucker Carlson, are you kidding me? Whoo! That manâ€™s a beast. Who else could fill an entire show each night asking questions that Google could easily answer?
[as Tucker Carlson] Do vaccines work? Who really won the election? Whoâ€™s the president right now? Is this America?
[normal voice] Gripping stuff. But if weâ€™re honest, people, thereâ€™s so much happening in the world right now. Sometimes it can be overwhelming, and you just want to tune it all out. And thatâ€™s why I love watching CNN. Whereâ€™s Jeff Zucker, by the way? Also couldnâ€™t make it? Whatâ€™s happening over there? Apparently Jeff got fired after he tried to keep his workplace relationship a secret, which is weird because if he really didnâ€™t want anyone to know about it, he could have just made a show about it on CNN+. I know, I know. Itâ€™s so sad. CNN+ gone but forgotten.
You know who I blame? You know who I blame, CNN? I blame John King. Thatâ€™s who. Yeah, John. Your magic wall can predict how every person in the country is going to vote in every county. But it couldnâ€™t give you a heads-up that nobody wanted more CNN? They spent $300 million on CNN+. $300 million! Can I be honest, CNN? I think Stanley Tucci was playing you guys. Yeah. No, I think that dude knew exactly where Italy was. And he was just going to keep searching as long as you were paying. $300 million! Do you understand how much money that is?
I do get it. Streaming, they say, is the future. As the old saying goes, â€œYou got to spend money to make sure that Chris Cuomo doesnâ€™t get any wrongful-termination lawsuits.â€
And thatâ€™s not the only big change going on at CNN. They just brought on Chris Licht. Yeah, my man over there, Chris, as the new head of news. Oof! His first order of business? Hire a guy who knows how to turn off the â€œbreaking newsâ€ banner. Yeah. What happened with that? Did they just put it on during the OJ chase and then never figured out how to get rid of it? The news is not always breaking.
But this is an interesting time for the media world. As with many industries, the pandemic was a major disruption for journalists. But I also think it helped humanize you, honestly. Millions of Americans watched TV anchors reporting from inside their own homes. Meanwhile, reporters in print media were like, â€œWe get it. You have homes. Way to show off.â€
And we have to face the facts. The media is in a tough position. You did say that, Mr President. Informing the American public is harder than ever before. Youâ€™re battling conspiracy theories that the election was stolen by George Soros, that JFK Jr is still alive, that everyone in this room is a secret pedophile. And thatâ€™s just what Clarence Thomasâ€™ wife believes. Itâ€™s insane, people. This is truly the golden era of conspiracy theories, whether itâ€™s the right wing believing Trump can still win the 2020 election or the left believing Joe Biden can still win the 2024 election. Thank you, Mr President.
And so, as we sit in this room tonight, people, I really hope you all remember what the real purpose of this evening is. Yes, itâ€™s fun. Yes, we dress nice. Yes, the people eat, they drink, we have fun. But the reason weâ€™re here is to honor and celebrate the fourth estates and what you stand for â€” what you stand for â€” an additional check and balance that holds power to account and gives voice to those who otherwise wouldnâ€™t have one. And Iâ€™m not just talking about CNN or Fox or any of the other major organizations. Iâ€™m talking about everyone, you know? The young journalists we saw today. You know, intrepid journalists who arenâ€™t even in this room in Flint, Michigan. Or that daring reporter at the Des Moines Register or the unflinching local newscaster in El Paso, Texas. Every single one of you, whether you like it or not, is a bastion of democracy. And if you ever begin to doubt your responsibilities, if you ever begin to doubt how meaningful it is, look no further than whatâ€™s happening in Ukraine. Look at whatâ€™s happening there. Journalists are risking and even losing their lives to show the world whatâ€™s really happening. You realize how amazing it is. In America, you have the right to seek the truth and speak the truth even if it makes people in power uncomfortable, even if it makes your viewers or your readers uncomfortable. You understand how amazing that is? I stood here tonight and I made fun of the president of the United States, and Iâ€™m going to be fine. I am going to be fine, right? Do you really understand what a blessing it is? Maybe itâ€™s happened for so long that it might slip your mind. Itâ€™s a blessing. In fact, here, ask yourself this question. Honestly, ask yourself this question. If Russian journalists who are losing their livelihoods, as you were talking about, Steve, and their freedom for daring to report on what their own government is doing, if they had the freedom to write any words, to show any stories, or to ask any questions, if they had basically what you have, would they be using it in the same way that you do? Ask yourself that question every day because you have one of the most important roles in the world.
Thank you so much for having me. I appreciate you. Please be careful leaving tonight. We all know this administration doesnâ€™t handle evacuations well.
Good night, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Ladies, gentlemen, and everybody, put your hands together. Please welcome to the stage Ali Wong!
Hi, everybody! We love you, Ali! Thank you. You know, Iâ€™m very jealous and bitter that when a man finds any ounce of mainstream success in comedy, they get to date models, actresses, and pop singers. One of my dear friends is arguably one of the top stand-up comics in the world. And for the past year and a half, sheâ€™s been dating a magician. I was like, â€œOkay, you know, no judgment, girl, but is he at least, like, a good magician?â€ â€œIs he, like, the best magician like how you are one of the best stand-up comedians?â€ I looked that dude up on Yelp, he got two stars. Thatâ€™s what being one of the best female stand-up comics will achieve you. A â€œainâ€™t shitâ€ magician.
See, because when you are a woman with money, power, and respect, your romantic optionsÂ do not expand. They decline! Now, I am told itâ€™s because men are threatened by women with money, power, and respect. What do you think is going to happen to you, huh? You think your dick is gonna get acquired in a hostile takeover? I bet most men in this theater have never, ever had your dick sucked by a woman that makes a lot more money than you. And let me tell you something. It is spectacular, okay? It is. It is. Why wouldnâ€™t it be? If she got the skills to earn money, power, and respect, you donâ€™t think she got good pattern recognition? Those skills transfer. You should feel so lucky, so flattered, so blessed and highly favored, if you ever had the opportunity to get your dick sucked by a woman that makes a lot more money than you. Because out of all the things this important woman could be doing with her valuable timeâ€¦ Yeah. All of her responsibilities, all the interesting opportunities and deals knocking at her door, but no. She chose to get on her knees and stick your $40,000-a-year dick in her mouthâ€¦ in your Toyota Yaris.
But no. None of you, not a single man in here knows what itâ€™s like to cum on the face of a millionaire. Sure, youâ€™ve gotten head. But have you ejaculated onto a great American mind? Has your sperm swam in the eyes of an icon? Have you been deep-throated by a voice of a generation? I donâ€™t think so! Itâ€™s highly unlikely that any man in hereâ€¦ Well, any straight man in here, knows what itâ€™s like to cum on the face of a millionaire. First of all, how many female, self-made millionaires are there to begin with? And then out of that pool, how many of them gonna let you cum on their face? Thereâ€™s three of us, okay? Yeah, I donâ€™t even know who the other two are. You think Ellen gonna let you cum on her face? You think Oprah gonna let you go to Montecito and stomp on all her vegetables?
I love to get cummed on, on the face. I do. Because itâ€™s so nasty and is so easy. It is so easy, especially when you compare it to sucking dick, which is so physically taxing. The choking, the eyes watering. And if you really want to keep it 100, you got to add the pepper grinding. A lot, you know? Whenever I get a deep tissue massage, the masseuse is always like, â€œDo you sit and work at a computer all day?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, I sucked dick last night.â€ â€œNow I canâ€™t look to the left.â€
So in addition to all of that labor, when you suck dick, there is all of this performing and pretending involved. You have to tell all of these lies. â€œThis is the biggest dick Iâ€™ve ever had in my mouth.â€ â€œI love sucking your cock. It makes my pussy so wet.â€ â€œYummy!â€ But you have to tell the lies to make the man cum faster. The lies will set you free! But then when you get cummed on on the face, your only job as the woman is to make an enthusiastic expression. And then your other assignment is to not laughâ€¦ while this grown-ass man is straddling your rib cage, he looking down at you, you looking up at him, and you see him from this very unflattering angle where he got that Jabba the Hutt double chin, you know? He all possessed by the Holy Spirit. â€œLook at me, Mommy, watch me, pay attention, look at me!â€
Young men in particular, they donâ€™t like women with money, power, and respect, because they know you canâ€™t tell that kind of woman what to do. Young men want a woman thatâ€™s chill. Thatâ€™s a quality in a partner that they seek out and brag about. â€œBro, Iâ€™m dating this new chick.â€ â€œSheâ€™s so chill.â€ â€œShe doesnâ€™t give a fuck about what I do â€™cause sheâ€™s chill.â€ â€œShe lets me do whatever I want â€™cause sheâ€™s dead inside.â€ â€œSheâ€™s chill.â€ â€œSheâ€™s like a corpse with tits. Itâ€™s awesome.â€ â€œSheâ€™s chill.â€
I have never,Â ever wanted to date a man that was chill. â€˜Cause chillÂ donâ€™t pay the bills. My nephew is 25 years old, and he is dating this architect. My goodness, she is so smart and interesting, successful, and charismatic, and we all hope that he marries her one day. But he called me up earlier this week and he was like, â€œYou know, Auntie Ali, I think Iâ€™mma break up with her.â€ â€œYeah, because sheâ€™s a boss at work, and so she thinks itâ€™s okay to come home and boss me around.â€ I was like, â€œOh.â€ â€œWell, that shitâ€™s gonna happen to you no matter what.â€ â€œWhether she a boss, whether she employed or unemployed, once you get married and have kids, your wife gonna boss you around.â€ â€œAnd you would know that if you watched House Hunters.â€
House Hunters is a show on HGTV where a couple pretends that thereâ€™s a decision to be made together. And they go on this fake-ass journey looking at three different houses, and the audience is meant to be left in suspense. â€œWhich house are they gonna choose?â€ Itâ€™s whichever one Barbara wanted in the first place, okay? And Barbara, who lives in Boise, Idaho, or wherever the fuck these HGTV shows are filmed where houses cost $5,000 an acreâ€¦ Barbara, she donâ€™t got money, power, or respect. But Barbara is a woman, and all women are very good at being extremely unpleasantâ€¦ and holding your happiness and self-esteem hostage until we get what we fucking deserve, okay? Yes. That is a superpower that we evolved to compensate for our lack of earning potential. You canâ€™t tell any woman what to do, so you might as well pick the bitch that will give you health insurance, okay?
I know exactly why thereâ€™s a disproportionate amount of men that do stand-up. Itâ€™s all because of fan pussy. We call them chuckle fuckers. These poor, naÃ¯ve women who get dickmatized when they laugh. And fan pussy is so motivating because fan pussy is young and sexy and exciting. Fan pussy is a great reward for doing stand-up comedy. And fan dick is frightening. Any man watching me, listening to what I have to say, and thinking to themselves, â€œI want to fuck herâ€¦â€ is a raging psychopath. And has extremely good taste. Fan dick is not interested in showing me a good time. Fan dick wants to trim my pubes and sew them into wigs for his antique doll collection. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t see more women doing stand-up. There is no reward, only danger and punishment. Lot of my male stand-up comic friends be hooking up with women, beautiful, gorgeous women, through the DMs. Direct messaging. I never check my DMs. And when I do, itâ€™s only to see if Sanrio, the owners of Hello Kitty, have finally contacted me to offer sponsorship. Yeah. Come on! I think Iâ€™d be a great fit, and I want all of that shit. I want the Gudetama pajamas. I want the erasers that smell like the gum. And I want the gum that tastes like the erasers. I want all of that shit. But no. My DMs are full of these Silence of the Lambs motherfuckers. Itâ€™s these dudes who always have zero followers. Do you know anybody who doesnâ€™t know anybody? They donâ€™t even offer to take me out to dinner or lick my pussy. They just threaten to decapitate me if I donâ€™t let them smell my feet.
And itâ€™s a shame, you know? Itâ€™s very disturbing, this disparity in quality between fan pussy and fan dick. It is so upsetting to a person like me. Because I think about cheating on my husbandâ€¦ every five minutes. I havenâ€™t done it yet. Not because Iâ€™m a good person, only because no worthy opportunity has presented itself.
My mom doesnâ€™t understand, she canâ€™t relate to these feelings of wanting to fool around outside of your marriage, because sheâ€™s an immigrant woman who was born in 1940. Her world is a lot smaller than mine. The only men my mother has ever had an actual conversation with are my brother and my dad. Thatâ€™s it. I, on the other hand, have met the entire cast of The Avengers. And I want all of them to cum on my face. I think Iâ€™m going through a mid-life crisis. Having two C-sections and being the breadwinner of my family has turned me into a 50-year-old man. I had a colonoscopy a couple years ago. That is some 50-year-old man shit right there. What had happened was I, all of a sudden, got extremely bloated over a very short period of time. And it was so extreme to the point where I thought I was pregnant again. And I took a test, and it was negative. And then my OBGYN became very concerned that I was showing symptoms of ovarian cancer, because it runs in my family. And so then she ordered a CT scan, and the results came back. And she said to me, â€œOkay, Ali.â€ â€œWell, you know, the good news is that you donâ€™t have ovarian cancer, okay? And thenâ€¦â€ â€œThe bad news is that, Ali, you are full of shit.â€ â€œStop giggling, Ali, stop it. This is serious, okay?â€ On the report, the radiologist wrote, â€œThe results are remarkable.â€ Which, to me, seems like the radiologist gave me an A++. She was like, â€œNo, thatâ€™s bad.â€ When the radiologist writes â€œThe results are remarkable,â€ what that translates to is, â€œOh my goodness, I donâ€™t understand how this tiny Vietnamese mom fit this football field of doo-doo inside of her body.â€ â€œI have never seen this in my 30 years as a radiologist, and I cannot wait to text screenshots of this to all my radiologist friends.â€ So then a GI specialist was called in, and I saw her look at the results, and she went like this. And then she turns to me and says, â€œMiss Wong, I am so sorry that I gasped in front of your face.â€ â€œThat was so unprofessional of me.â€ â€œI know exactly who you are.â€ â€œPlease do not talk about how I just did that on stage.â€ â€œBut, you know, I have to admit that Iâ€™m clearly alarmed by what I see here.â€ â€œYou are backed up well into your small intestine, and Iâ€™m almost certain that there is some sort of mass, and most likely a tumor thatâ€™s causing all of this blockage.â€ â€œSo weâ€™re going to have to perform a colonoscopy to see whatâ€™s going on in there.â€ I was like, â€œWhy? You guys just did a CT scan.â€ And she was like, â€œYes, it is true that the whole point of a CT scan is to see inside of your body, but the lasers couldnâ€™t penetrate the Great Wall of Shit thatâ€™s inside you.â€ â€œAnd they just ricocheted and bounced back into the machine, and now the machine is shook, soâ€¦ weâ€™re going to have to stick a camera up your ass.â€ And I was so nervous. But what I didnâ€™t know was that right before the procedure, they give you propofol. And I have to say that as a working mother of twoâ€¦ getting to take a drug-induced nap for an hourâ€¦ was well worth having a news crew up my butt. It was luxurious. When I woke up from the colonoscopy, I was like, â€œI want another colonoscopy.â€ And then it turned out that my colon was perfectly healthy, and I figured out that what caused that huge traffic jam was the summer before, I was shooting this movie called Always Be My Maybe. Oh, thank you. Yeah, it was a big-ass deal because it was the first movie I had ever co-written and starred in as the lead. And I worked on it for 12 hours a day, every day for six weeks straight, and I was so busy that I forgot to take a shitâ€¦ for six weeks. The movie shot in Vancouver and in San Francisco, and I have no recollection of shitting in Vancouver or in San Francisco. I just straight up forgot. Something like that would never happen to a man. Men, you never forget to take a shit ever. Ever. How could you, when you sit on the toilet and have your sacred ritual every morning to summon the shit? You sit there from 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. You sit there with all of your reading materials, your iPad battery just burning up the sperm in your balls. You sit there at the most crucial time of the day, when your wife and kids need you and the bathroom the most. You sit there to avoid reality and all of your responsibility in life. Youâ€™re too scared to ask your wife for alone time, so instead you just passively-aggressively take it by chasing your wife and kids out of the bathroom with the stank of your selfish-ass shit! Women, we donâ€™t do that, okay? We have too much guilt and shame to sit there every morning at the same time to summon the shit. Instead, the shit comes to us at the most inconvenient time of the day. When weâ€™re in the middle of a meeting, or onstage taping our third Netflix special. But when you feel that first turtle head peek out, you gotta squeeze your butt cheeks in, suck the poo-poo back up into your generous, loving, self-sacrificing soul. But then at some point, you gots to go, and then itâ€™s an emergency. Itâ€™s always an emergency when a woman finally takes a shit, and thatâ€™s why every womanâ€™s public restroom looks like a post-apocalyptic zombie nightmare, where there is blood on the walls and pizza on the record player. My life has changed dramatically in the past seven years. Seven years ago, I pressured the shit out of my then-boyfriend to propose to me. Every day, I was in his earâ€¦ â€œWhen you going to ask me to marry you?â€ â€œIâ€™m not gonna wait forever!â€ â€œEverybody wants this pussy.â€ Nobody else wanted this pussy, but I had to make up these fairy tales to add pizzazz to the ultimatum, you know? It was crazy, but my wish came true. He proposed, we got married. We bought a house, had two kids. Fast-forward to seven years later, present day, Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know why I did that.â€ I think that what happened was at the time, my future in comedy was looking very uncertain, you know? I was really struggling. Like, I was eating cough drops for dessert. It was so sad. And I panicked. I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know if I can make it in this world on my own.â€ â€œSo I better trap this dude who graduated from Harvard Business School so that I donâ€™t end up homeless.â€ But now, I know that I can make it on my own. So I kind of want to just be on my own. Only other married people with kids can empathize with the deep envy I feel towards you single people, okay? You donâ€™t know how free you are. You can eat an edible at 2:00 p.m., go to the aquarium and watch the jellyfish go back and forth. You donâ€™t gotta bring a giant bag with little Ziploc baggies of Goldfish, and toy cellphones. You can just go with whatâ€™s in your pockets. You single people, you donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to eat a cold quesadilla that your toddler threw on the floor, because itâ€™s easier to put it in your mouth than travel to the trash, while you repeat to yourself over and over that child abuse is illegal! You single people, if youâ€™re romantically involved with somebody, and then all of a sudden, that somebody reveals a personality trait that you donâ€™t like, you could just leave. Move to another city and never see their stupid face again. Because you didnâ€™t make a promise in front of your grandma and all your coworkers and ask your friends to buy you an Instant Pot. You didnâ€™t fuse your DNA to create human life that will forever ask you, â€œWhereâ€™s Daddy?â€ You single people, you donâ€™t have to go on a playdate, which is basically a blind date that your toddler sets you up onâ€¦ with some bitch you have zero chemistry with. You single people, you donâ€™t have to be nice to your mother because you need her for babysitting. You donâ€™t have to smile and listen to all of this unsolicited parenting advice from this woman who neglected the shit out of youâ€¦ because you want time to yourself to binge Bridgerton to feel alive again. Like you single people, I, too, was once free, okay? And then like an idiot, I asked this dude to ask me to go to prison. And now Iâ€™m in monogamy jail, and I donâ€™t know how to get out. Monogamy made sense when we lived until we were 40 years old. Yeah, Iâ€™m 39 right now, so if you told me that I had to do this shit for another year, Iâ€™d be like, â€œYeah, I could do that.â€ â€œI can rub it out to Aquaman for another year, itâ€™s fine.â€ â€œItâ€™s no big deal.â€ But as an Asian woman, Iâ€™m gonna live until Iâ€™m 95 years old. Thatâ€™s not even a joke, okay? that is statistically probable. My husband and I are the same age. Heâ€™ll most likely die when heâ€™s 85. So between 85 and 95 is when Iâ€™m morally allowed to fuck other people again. Itâ€™s too late. â€˜Cause at the age of 75 is when Asian women finally turn into an owl. You know what Iâ€™m talking about. Their tattooed eyebrows turn green and shit. They go bald, and then the few strands that are left, they perm the shit out of to make it more Jhirmack â€œbounce back.â€ And then they become obsessed with dried jujubes and just walk around in down jackets all day like this. I want to fuck other people nowâ€¦ before I metamorphosize into a nut sack with a visor. You want to cheat with me? You want to fuck around with me? You better give me two weeksâ€™ notice, okay? â€˜Cause you gotta give me time to go shopping for new underwear. Iâ€™ve been with the same dude for the last 10 years. So all my underwear looks like itâ€™s been snacked on by rats. Just looks like wardrobe from Les Miserables, okay? Like a tattered sail of a pirate ship. The elastic? Gone. So the crotch area hangs about five inches below my actual pussy, like a Indiana Jones suspension bridge, like a hammock in the Blue Bayou, okay? You want to fuck around with me? Let me know, so I got time to go to Target and get that sweet five-for-20 Xhilaration panty deal. Merona, whateverâ€™s on sale. In our society, there is no word for a male mistress. Thatâ€™s how taboo it is for women to cheat on their husbands. The only word Iâ€™ve ever heard is sancho, yes, because Mexican women cheat on their husbands, because their culture is mucho mÃ¡s mejor. Es la verdad, okay? It is. Iâ€™ve been saying this about Mexican people and Mexican culture for a long time. Iâ€™m like the Little Mermaid. I want to be part of your Telemundo, okay? Yes. Si se puede, con permiso, let me in. Come on. I like Fabuloso, okay? I like storing my pots and pans in the oven. Yeah. I like squeezing lime juice on everything. I like hickeys. I love hickeys. Generally, our society is very unforgiving of women who cheat on their husbands, and at the same time, itâ€™s so forgiving of men who cheat on their wives. Somehow money, power, and respect will earn a man the right to cheat. People will come to his defense and say, â€œOh, how could he be expected to resist all of that fan pussy?â€ â€œHe is so awesome, he deserves to cheat.â€ For women, no matter how much money, power, or respect you earn, you are never allowed to behave badly and get away with it. But thatâ€™s all I want to do. I want to have it all. I want to have a family, a career, and a side piece. The greatest trick women ever played on ourselves was making us believe that having it all was limited to having a family and a career. I got both of those things. Newsflash, itâ€™s not enough. Necesito mÃ¡s. I donâ€™t just want equal pay, I want equal pleasure. But it would be very threatening if all women wanted and felt like they deserved that, because then a bunch of women wouldnâ€™t be available to helping their husbands make their lives as easy as possible. Do you know how much more successful I would be if I had a wife? Some loving, devoted woman by my side who bought a bunch of fruit besides bananas? And put the duvet cover on the duvet? People donâ€™t like it when women cheat, you know, and theyâ€™ll really turn on you because they feel betrayed, especially if youâ€™re a mom. Itâ€™s too contrary to your wholesome, loving image. And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m trying to let all of you know nowâ€¦ that Iâ€™m a real piece of shit, okay? I want you to really listen to me and understand this and believe me, so that youâ€™re not shocked or surprised, so that you donâ€™t abandon me when you see the TMZ video of my face getting fire-hosed by Michael B. Jordanâ€¦ while I chant, â€œWakanda forever!â€ I think another reason why a lot of women are hesitant to cheat is because itâ€™s too high stakes to put your family, your reputation, your life as you know it on the line, all for the probability that you most likely will not have an orgasm. Very difficult to make a woman, especially a new woman, cum. Itâ€™s so annoying. Itâ€™s a design flaw. Thereâ€™s too many factors. Thereâ€™s too much shit that has to align. The lighting, the temperature, the news. You canâ€™t be all up in your head about the global supply chain being backed up. I donâ€™t deserve to cum when the Dow Jones is down 500 points and I still donâ€™t understand what cryptocurrency is. Who can cum in times like these? So in order for a woman to cum, all this shit has to align, right? And then on top of that, the dude got to have skills. He gotta have great timing. He gotta know how to come in real slow and soft and romantic and tenderoni in the beginningâ€¦ and then get real rapey by the end. In, like, a consensual way, of course. But a lot of dudes, they fuck that timing up, right? They come out the gates guns blazing, like Braveheart coming over the hill, justâ€¦ â€œMortal Kombat!â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œOkay, Iâ€™m bleeding andâ€¦ think you rubbed my clit off onto the floor, and now itâ€™s lost with the dust bunnies.â€ And then some dudes, they do the opposite, right? They maintain this whole, like, candlelit, walk-on-the-beach energyâ€¦ Close your eyes Make a wish â€¦throughout the entire course of the sex, and itâ€™s like, â€œNah, dude. In the last 30 seconds, I need you to put me in a headlock and say racist shit to me. Okay?â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œYeah, I want my eyebrows to fly off my face, and I want you to degrade me until I go deaf and mute at the same time.â€ â€œYou gotta shape-shift, bro.â€ Nothing more satisfying to a woman then when a man goes through a sudden and extreme transformation that she is responsible for. You know, would be such a shame to go through all that trouble of cheating to end up having to fake an orgasm. In fact, I donâ€™t think any of us women should be faking orgasms anymore. Yeah. No more faking orgasms. I mean, you really think about it, that is some nutty-ass shit that we women do. Thatâ€™s a skill that you taught yourself. That wasnâ€™t passed down to you from your mother. You taught yourself to do that shit out of survival. And it is wildly indicative of how terrified we women are of offending a man, that we would rather fake an orgasm than simply sayâ€¦ â€œHey, I just want to go home.â€ â€œThis is so not awesome.â€ â€œAnd I feel like Iâ€™ve really tried to tell you where to put it, where not to put it, how fast, how slow, and you straight up just donâ€™t listen, you know, soâ€¦ Iâ€™d really like to just go back to my house and fold clothes.â€ Men are so much more incentivized to cheat because youâ€™re going to cum no matter what. Itâ€™s so easy for a man to cum. All you need is a wet hole. You donâ€™t even need that! Men love to jerk off in front of women all the time. Iâ€™ve seen, like, 70 men jack off in my lifetime. Men love to show you their masturbation practice. But for me, you know, if a man is not performing at the caliber I need him to perform at, Iâ€™m not all of a sudden going to leap onto his neck and start fingering myself over his face, you know? Like, â€œOh, you have erectile dysfunction?â€ â€œNo problem. I got it.â€ â€œLet me just dangle my pubes, my long-ass pandemic pubes over your forehead and squirt into your nose hole. You donâ€™t like it?â€ â€œWho cares? Whoâ€™s gonna believe you, you young, powerless boy?â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œWhat the fuck am I doing?â€ So if you havenâ€™t seen the movie, itâ€™s a romantic comedyâ€¦ where I play a celebrity chef who falls back in love with her childhood friend. And in the movie, my character hooks up with three different, very good-looking, very iconic, very sexy Asian American men. I know, itâ€™s like, who wrote this thing, right? Likeâ€¦ Whose idea was this? And while shooting, all of my girlfriends kept on asking me, â€œOkay, Ali, on the DL, you gonna hook up with one of your costars?â€ You know, I came this closeâ€¦ to fucking the food consultant. It was this 29-year-old Persian dude who had tattoos all over his arms and his chest, and when the wind blew, oh my God, he was so ripped, you could see everything. You could see the Kingâ€™s Hawaiian, you could see the cum gutters pointing you straight to the kingdom of heaven. You could see it all, you know? And we spent one Sunday morning butchering 18 raw chickens. That shit was like the â€œUnchained Melodyâ€ scene from Ghostâ€¦ but with salmonella. He had his arms wrapped around me, and I almost sliced my hand off, because I could feel his 29-year old dick getting hard up against my spine. Yeah. See, the pussy can fake a orgasm, but the dick donâ€™t lie. I felt that biology and that truth right up against my back. I did not feel violated. I felt victorious. I did. As, like, a 39-year-old woman with two C-section scars, I was like, â€œOh my God, I am so powerful.â€ â€œI changed density, motherfucker, what!â€ â€œI am a wizard! Iâ€™m a blood bender! I could be in Avatar.â€ â€œLetâ€™s go, Appa. Letâ€™s go find Zuko and make out! Letâ€™s go!â€ And I went back to my hotel that afternoon and I pull down my pants, and my underwearâ€¦ looked like the bottom of a bird cage. Itâ€™s a mystery to me why Hello Kitty hasnâ€™t contacted me yet, you know? Itâ€™s like, come on, whatâ€™s up? When I saw that in my underwear, when I saw those loogies, I was like, â€œOh my God, I still got it!â€ There is still supply, given that there is fresh demand, okay? If you donâ€™t understand the supply and demand metaphor, what Iâ€™m trying to tell you is my body still produces pussy juice, people. Okay? And it was good pussy juice too. It was sparkly and glistening. Viscous but not too pasty. Pungent but not too dank, it wasâ€¦ It was. I took a little fun dip in there, that shit tasted like LaCroix Pamplemousse. It was quality. It couldâ€™ve sealed up all the holes in my underwear like Gorilla Glue, it wasâ€¦
You know, as much as I would love to cheat on my husband, I cannot afford to get a divorce. I canâ€™t, you know? The reality is, I need my husband way more than he needs me. It is ten times harder to find a decent husband than it is to find a great wife. Itâ€™s so fucking annoying, you know? Iâ€™m almost 40, so I have all these, like, acquaintances getting divorced right now. All these women, they keep coming up to meâ€¦ â€œAli, it is so difficult dating out there for a divorced woman.â€ â€œNone of these men can handle me, a strong woman.â€ â€œNone of these men want a strong woman.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™re an annoying woman, butâ€¦â€ I do believe that itâ€™s slim pickings out there, you know?
And then these women, they keep telling me about their battle and how ugly it is, how theyâ€™re fighting for full custody of their kids. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy?â€ Even half custody sounds like American Horror Story. I canâ€™t let go of my husband, you know? Heâ€™s very handsome, heâ€™s very sexy, heâ€™s very much my type. I have a very specific type. I like dudes who look as close to Keanu Reeves as possible. Yeah. And thatâ€™s my husband, straight up. Heâ€™s so good-looking, heâ€™s so interesting. He speaks three different languages. He introduced me to mushrooms and ayahuasca, changed my life. So in addition to being my husband, heâ€™s also my drug dealer. I canâ€™t lose that Shaman connect, you know? My husbandâ€™s so smart. He went to Carnegie Mellon, Harvard Business School. Heâ€™s a Fulbright scholar. He was smart enough to choose me, to invest in me, when I was 20 pounds heavier, had chronic acne and no money. He bought low. And if we get divorced, he going to sell high. I canâ€™t let him get away with that!
So my husband, heâ€™s all of these wonderful things, right? But most importantly, he gives me permission to be myself. Which perhaps, for a wild, untamable spirit, is the most important quality to find in a man. But people think itâ€™s so difficult for my husband to do something so simple as giving me permission to be myself. They always ask him, â€œOh my God, how do you feel about your wife Ali going up on stage in front of all of these strangers, talking about how much she wants to cheat on you?â€ You know, right now while weâ€™re all here, my husband is at home in the house that I boughtâ€¦ telling time on the Rolex I got him for Fatherâ€™s Dayâ€¦ jacking off to porn that he streams on the high-speed internet I pay for every month. So, he always tells meâ€¦ â€œYeah, you go ahead, you know youâ€¦â€ He doesnâ€™t give a shit about what I say on stage because heâ€™s too busy living the life I wanted for myself. Iâ€™m the one leaning in while he is lying down. And now that Iâ€™m the clear breadwinner, he donâ€™t choke me like he used to. Itâ€™s too high stakes if I die. Iâ€™ll be like, â€œHarder, come on, harder!â€ And heâ€™ll be like, â€œBut I really want a PS5.â€ â€œItâ€™s all sold out, and the waitlists and the ports are all full.â€ People like to assume that because my husband is very spiritual and because heâ€™s Asian American, that heâ€™s some kind of softy, when the truth is he got this backbone made of pure, solid steel. He is a motherfucker. And whenever we get into an argument and I raise my voice, heâ€™ll look me in the eye and say to me, â€œOh, you donâ€™t talk to me like that.â€ And then Iâ€™ll be likeâ€¦ â€œIâ€™mma suck your dick.â€ â€œYou put me in my place again.â€ â€œAnd then you give me permission to be myself, and then you tell me what to do, and then you celebrate me.â€ And that, single people, is what a healthy marriage looks like, okay?
Iâ€™ve been Ali Wong, have a good night, everybody. Thank you!

Again, sit that one out. Sexting. As a dyslexic adult, sexting, that is the hurdle. I was dating a woman. She was a strong feminist. We would sext, and I obviously wanted to turn her on but I also wanted her to know that I was an ally. One time, she sent me a sext. Sheâ€™s like, â€œHow you gonna fuck me?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œLike you deserve an equal wage.â€

You know, I could just be terrible for ten minutes and then go home, and I wouldnâ€™t feel that bad, you know? Still a pretty good deal, right?
[audience] Yeah!
Yeah, I mean, I like doing nice theaters and everything, but sometimes, you gotta come back and compete with chicken wings. Ah, but itâ€™s nice to be here. Nice to be back in New York. You know, I donâ€™t live here no more. I live in London, andâ€¦
[person whoops]
Yeah. I like it there, but itâ€™s nice to be back in New York. Always a lot of love for me here. Sometimes too much love, you know. The other day I went to a restaurant and there was a line. Everybody was checking their COVID passes and stuff. I walked up and the guy was like, â€œOh, Aziz, youâ€™re all good, bro. Just come on in.â€ And I was like, â€œNo, no, no, no, no.â€ Please check my pass. Uh, Iâ€™m not out here trying to have dinner with Kyrie Irving and Nicki Minaj. I got an extra ten seconds. Please.â€
Weâ€™re all pretty close, man. You guys had to show your COVID pass, right? Yeah. Or your easily obtainable fake COVID pass. Who designed these things, man? Canâ€™t we get the squad that did the McDonaldâ€™s Monopoly pieces? Those have so much more security. Thereâ€™s like holograms and shit. You go into a McDonaldâ€™s, theyâ€™re like, â€œThis isnâ€™t Pennsylvania Avenue. Get this shit out of here.â€ COVID pass team was like, â€œWhite paper, black lines. I think weâ€™re done, Jim.â€
I mean, in theory, weâ€™re all vaccinated, right? At this point, like, 96% of doctors are vaccinated, and I feel like, at this point, if you donâ€™t want the vaccine, youâ€™re kind of like a white dude with dreadlocks. Yeah, Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s some people telling you itâ€™s a good idea, but pretty soon, the people around you arenâ€™t gonna be able to breathe.
I gotâ€¦ You know, I was in London and I got one shot of AstraZeneca, then I had to come to LA for something, and I called my doctor. I was like, â€œShould I just get the Johnson & Johnson?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, go ahead and get it so youâ€™re fully vaxxed.â€ So then I got Johnson & Johnson, and then, recently I got a booster. I got a Pfizer. So, I got a lot going on. Iâ€™m like one of those DJ Khaled songs with way too many features. â€œAnother one.â€
People go in on the folks that donâ€™t want the vaccine though, right? Whoâ€™s that guy, a football player? Aaron Rodgers. Yeah.
What do you think about that guy?
[audience boos]
[person] Fuck him.
Fuck him! People hate that guy, though. â€œHeâ€™s a fucking idiot!â€ Itâ€™s like, all right. Calm down. Heâ€™s a football player. He read some articles, he got skeptical, he did some research. Are you stunned he came to the wrong conclusion? Did you really think he was gonna crack the case? Did you think Fauci was gonna be out there like, â€œI just got off the phone with Aaron Rodgersâ€? This poor guy. Itâ€™s like weâ€™re all in high school and weâ€™re making fun of the quarterback for doing bad on the science test. â€œYouâ€™re a dummy, Aaron. Youâ€™re a dummy. You donâ€™t know anything, do you? Youâ€™re a dum-dum.â€ This guy makes a living getting hit in the head. Can we cut him a break? I guess he did kind of lie, right? They were like, â€œDude, are you vaccinated?â€ He was like, â€œIâ€¦ [blabbers] Iâ€™m immunized. Iâ€¦ [blabbers] My doctor gave me some powders from Jamba Juice and Iâ€¦â€
He did come off a little arrogant in some of those interviews and stuff, right? He was out there, heâ€™s like, â€œYou know, Iâ€™m a critical thinker.â€ Oh, no. Was he, like, running the scientific method? â€œQuestion: Should I get the vaccine? Hypothesis: I donâ€™t think so. Data gathering: Listen to some podcasts and talking to a few sketchy doctors. Conclusion: No way, JosÃ©.â€ I donâ€™t think heâ€™s an idiot, though, okay? I donâ€™t think him, Nicki Minaj, any of these people are idiots. Iâ€™m not here to say that, okay? And I just think theyâ€™re trapped in a different algorithm than you are. You know what I mean by that? And If youâ€™re calling them idiots, youâ€™re trapped in another algorithm. I know everything youâ€™re gonna say about everything. â€œAll these dummies. Theyâ€™re taking horse medicine.â€ All right, well, technically, humans can take that medicine, all right? Yes, thereâ€™s nothing showing it actually helps with COVID, but when you just say theyâ€™re taking horse medicine, it pushes them further away. I donâ€™t know, man. We just gotta figure out some way to have some empathy. Weâ€™re all kinda just trapped in our own little world. And unless we figure out how to talk to each other in real life again, it doesnâ€™t matter what the problem is. I donâ€™t know what the answer is. Maybe click on some of the stuff they click on for a few days. See whatâ€™s going on. Donâ€™t go too hard, though. End of the week, youâ€™ll be out there like, â€œFauciâ€™s a pedophile.â€
Iâ€™m just saying, this current strategy, just shaming people, isnâ€™t gonna work. Like, you see these videos people make shaming anti-vax people? They take all their tweets and stuff. The video always goes the same way, right? It shows tweets like, â€œThis COVID thingâ€™s a hoax. Iâ€™m never wearing a mask. Fuck these mandates. Open everything up already. Oh, God, I just tested positive. Iâ€™m in the hospital.â€ And then their cousin writes, â€œThey died.â€ And then the person that made the video is likeâ€¦ [triumphant laughter] Yeah, thatâ€™s gonna help. You know, my uncle didnâ€™t get the vaccine, and he passed away. It was very sad. My dad talked to him four days before and was begging him to get the vaccine, and he didnâ€™t want to do it. It was very sad. My dad has a lot of siblings. I was talking to my aunt and she was like, â€œI canâ€™t believe one of us is gone.â€ It broke my heart. You know, I could hear it in her voice. How she felt it was preventable, like it didnâ€™t need to happen. You know, I donâ€™t think my uncleâ€™s an idiot, all right? I just think he gotâ€¦ he got hit by this other thing we created now, which is a culture where the flow of information has been completely corrupted. Think about the biggest companies in the world. Theyâ€™re all making money off information. So, of course, people are making money off disinformation. Thatâ€™s why the skepticism is there. People are making money off of it. People arenâ€™t normally this skeptical of the medical community. Think about all the crazy things youâ€™ve done in your life, â€™cause the doctor told you to. You never asked no questions.
Look at Ice Cube. Ice Cube doesnâ€™t want to get the vaccine. He was supposed to do this movie called Oh Hell No, which, sadly, weâ€™ll never see, and, umâ€¦ He was supposed to get the vaccine and he wouldnâ€™t do it. But you know whatâ€™s weird? A few months before the pandemic, Ice Cube got a colonoscopy. [quietly] You know what a colonoscopy is? Basically, Ice Cube went to the doctor. The doctor was like, â€œHey, you got a problem in your stomach and we need to do a colonoscopy.â€ And he was like, â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ And they were like, â€œUh, well, sit down, Ice Cube. Basically, you need to drink a gallon of fluid and just shit out everything in your body. Just clean out your system, right? Next day, you come in, weâ€™ll put you under, and weâ€™ll shove a rubber hose up your asshole thatâ€™s got a camera on the end of it and weâ€™ll go in there and film for a few hours and see whatâ€™s going on, and weâ€™ll run some tests, and when weâ€™re done, weâ€™ll wake you up.â€ And he was like, â€œAll right, well, do what you gotta do.â€
He didnâ€™t say any of the shit heâ€™s saying now. He wasnâ€™t out there like, â€œI donâ€™t understand the science.â€ He wasnâ€™t out there like, â€œMy butthole, my rights.â€ No. He was passed out with four strangers around him. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™re having a little trouble.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou can do it, put your back into it.â€ They were in there for hours. For hours! What were they doing? Filming a limited series? Does season two of Queenâ€™s Gambit take place in Ice Cubeâ€™s large intestine? I donâ€™t know if Ice Cubeâ€™s had a colonoscopy, uh, butâ€¦ heâ€™sâ€¦ heâ€™s over 45 years old. He shouldâ€™ve had one. Itâ€™sâ€¦ Itâ€™s a screening colonoscopy to make sure you donâ€™t have colon cancer. So, letâ€™s hope my joke is true.
You know, one cool thing, you know, after lockdown and everything, a lot of people stood up for themselves. In terms of their job, they reassessed their lives and their work life, and, you know, they were like, â€œLook, man, if you donâ€™t pay me right, you donâ€™t give me these benefits, Iâ€™m gonna leave.â€ And the companies are like, â€œAll right, then, leave. Weâ€™ll just get other people that arenâ€™t as good at the job, and then everything in the world will be a little bit shittier.â€ And thatâ€™s what it is now, right? Like, everything is just a little bit shittier, like, everywhere. Like, thereâ€™s never enough people around. Everyone just running like, â€œItâ€™s my first day!â€ Even here, tonight, things are a little bit shittier. Thereâ€™s just not enough people. You know what I mean? Everything is a little bit shittier and, you know what, we fucking deserve it, â€™cause we took all these people for granted, man. They all worked so hard, wasnâ€™t getting paid proper, still not getting paid proper, and we just take â€™em for granted. Of course theyâ€™re getting screwed over. We all know theyâ€™re getting screwed over, right? Think about it. How can you sell a cheeseburger for 99 cents? How can you do that? If I gave you 99 cents and said, â€œMake me a cheeseburger,â€ what the fuck would you do? Theyâ€™re screwing everybody, from the guy in the meat factory to the guy that actually sells you the burger. And now, you got to admit, thereâ€™s no such thing as an unskilled worker. If you go to a Wendyâ€™s and everything goes according to plan, there were some skilled people in that Wendyâ€™s, â€™cause nowâ€¦ now, you go in there, every Frosty comes with a free nugget, all right?
I support all these people that are striking and all this shit, â€™causeâ€¦ I mean, God. I hope they bring â€™em back and pay â€™em proper â€™cause itâ€™s rough out there sometimes. You ever been out to, like, a Chipotle in Pennsylvania, like, right now? Itâ€™s intense. You go in there, itâ€™s like the Chipotle got COVID. You go in there, just two dudes likeâ€¦ [screaming, groaning] â€œGive me the peas!â€ [groans] And then you walk up, youâ€™re like, â€œUm, can I have some extra guacamole?â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œWe donâ€™t have any guacamole! Thereâ€™s an avocado shortage and our guacamole guy quit last week, and now he makes $50,000 a year doing guacamole videos on TikTok!â€
Sometimes, I wonder if Iâ€™m messing up at my job. Not the stand-up stuff. Iâ€™m talking more in a bigger sense. Every day, I look at the news, I see some article about some actor celebrity selling some company for hundreds of millions of dollars that has nothing to do with what they do. Iâ€™m not getting involved in any of this. I donâ€™t have a beverage. No skin care line. Skin care? I could easily get into that. Iâ€™m Indian. Iâ€™m gonna have good skin. I could easily trick the whites. â€œOh, itâ€™s a coconut oil from my great grandmotherâ€™s village, and Iâ€™ve beenâ€¦ Itâ€™s how I maintain this youthful Indian glow.â€ All my friends in the industry, theyâ€™re hip to it. They all want a piece. No one wants to make The Chronic. Everybody wants to make Beats by Dre headphones. You ever see an interview with Drake or something? Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œDrake, whatâ€™s going on with your new album?â€ â€œMy new album? What about my new health care system? Yeah, Iâ€™m opening up OVO Hospitals all over the country. Weâ€™ve got nurses wearing OVO gear, we got the best doctors in the game.â€ Got a beat of all these doctors, likeâ€¦
â™ª I got my eyes on you â™ª
I mean, Iâ€™m an okay comedian. Iâ€™m a terrible businessman. Iâ€™m up here for free right now. Kevin Hart would never be up here for free, okay? If Kevin were up here right now, it would be livestreaming to his new lawn mower or something. â€œYeah, Iâ€™m partnering up with my friends over at John Deere and every time you mow your grass, a hologram of me pops up and Iâ€™m doing my new stand-up special. Itâ€™s called, Kevin Hart, Man, This is Crazy, Iâ€™m Doing Stand-up While You Mow Your Grassâ€! Iâ€™m not judging any of those people. Itâ€™s just not for me, you know. I remember, one time in my career, I felt like I was doing too much. I felt a little stretched thin, and I ran into Frank Ocean at a party, and I was like, â€œFrank, how do you do it, man? Never do any press, you barely tour, and you only put out your music when you really want to. Whatâ€™s the secret?â€ And he said, â€œOh, man, you just got to be comfortable making less money, thatâ€™s all.â€ And I was like, â€œOh, shit. Make less money, you say? [breathes heavily] Never thought about that.â€ But I did. And I still do. You see me. I donâ€™t do a lot of stuff. I just do the stuff I really care about, you know? And, Frankâ€¦ Frank started a jewelry line, so I donâ€™t know. Guess he changed his mind. â€œOh, shit, I got too comfortable making less money.â€
Last time I was in New York, it was right before the election. That was an interesting time, right? Everyone had all this energy, you know. Everyone was out there like, â€œWe gotta do something! We gotta stop Trump, and weâ€™ve gotta save the planet! We gotta do everything we can!â€ And then, Trump lost, and it was like, â€œWe did it! Letâ€™s make the world a better place!â€ And I come back two years later. Itâ€™s the same shitty place. It just feels like we unfollowed him from Twitter. Thatâ€™s it. You just see him less. You know what I mean? And Iâ€™m not saying him and Joe Biden are the same thing. Donâ€™t hit me with that. I get him. Yeah, infrastructure, I know. Iâ€™m just saying, what happened to us? What happened to all that energy? How come we canâ€™t channel that now, you know? Why arenâ€™t we out there like, â€œWe gotta help all these people after COVID. Thereâ€™s so many people that are displaced.â€ No, people arenâ€™t doing that. People are just out there like, â€œI wish I put more money in crypto.â€ â€œMatthias, are you going to that event tonight? Thereâ€™s, like, this pop-up for this new collaboration that Travis Scottâ€™s doing with, like, Citibank and Chips Ahoy and theyâ€™re selling these, like, limited edition Chips Ahoy designed by these, like, emerging artists, and, like, whenever you go, you get, like, this limited edition tote bag with, like, these limited edition T-shirts designed by these, like, eco-friendly emerging streetwear brands, and when you come home, the tote bag, like, turns into an NFT and, like, the NFT starts deejaying and itâ€™s all sustainable.â€ You know whoâ€™s worse than Trump? All of us, just collectively, you know, the human race. If you really step back and look at us, kind of a shitty group of people, right? Like, what do you see when you step back? You see, like, 30 people, right? Twenty people are doing okay, and ten people are like, â€œWe donâ€™t have clean drinking water or much else. Weâ€™re having a hard time.â€ The other 20 people are like, â€œI donâ€™t know, you live pretty far away. Iâ€™m not sure what you want me to do. Youâ€™re not really part of our crew, you know? I mean, I hear you, but, you know, I ordered groceries on my phone six minutes ago and theyâ€™re still not here, soâ€¦ Iâ€™m hungry too. [exhales] You know, I got my problems. I washed my duvet cover the other day. I tried to put the duvet back on. You ever done some shit like that? You ever been putting the duvet on, realize the buttons are on the other side and you had to flip it out and start over again? Perspective.â€ Itâ€™s pretty dark if you just take a step back, and you really think about how much suffering and poverty and starvation and death we just tolerate â€™cause itâ€™s out of sight, out of mind. Even in our own country. Homelessness, et cetera, we could fix it all just like that. You know how I know? â€˜Cause two years ago, people in rich countries started dying of a mysterious illness. And what did we do? We shut down the earth for two years! Every single one of us stayed in our fucking house every day. We didnâ€™t even go to work. â€œNo, donâ€™t go to work! Weâ€™ll just send you money every week!â€ â€œWhat? But what if this keeps going?â€ â€œWeâ€™ll just keep sending you money every week!â€ â€œWhat if itâ€™s six months, a year?â€ â€œWeâ€™ll just keep sending you money! Just stay in your house!â€ â€œYou have that much money?â€ â€œYes! Just stay in the house!â€ Thatâ€™s how much we have. Thereâ€™s a guy outside right now with a cup asking if anybody has a dollar to spare. We have so much. We just donâ€™t wanna give it to him. Why donâ€™t we wanna solve all these problems? One, it doesnâ€™t affect us, and two, they donâ€™t give us no content. We gotta have the content. Why did everyone get so riled up about Trump? Dude delivered the content. Say what you will about that man, the content was amazing. Day one he comes out, â€œI hate Mexicans.â€ I was like, â€œOh, shit! This is way better than any of those Obama speeches.â€ I mean, itâ€™s horrible, but very captivating. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so puzzled by these people that are like, â€œFuck Joe Biden.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBased on what? I never even see this dude.â€ What are you mad about? Whereâ€™s the content? What, that time he almost fell once? What are you talking about? You hate Kamala Harris? Iâ€™ve never even seen her. I was so excited, sheâ€™s, like, Indian. Thereâ€™s, like, more footage of Bigfoot than Kamala Harris, okay? This ladyâ€™sâ€¦ Iâ€™ve never seen her. There was that one piece of content in the beginning where sheâ€™s like, â€œWe did it, Joe!â€ And then sheâ€™s gone. Sheâ€¦ She disappeared like the original mom from The Fresh Prince. [whooping] Gotta have the content. If you donâ€™t have the content, you donâ€™t have the Internet. You donâ€™t have the Internet, you donâ€™t have the culture. The culture decides what we actually end up doing, right? Some of these things Iâ€™ve been talking about, theyâ€™re too boring. Wouldnâ€™t work in the system we have, right? You put them in there, be like, â€œIf we just figured out clean sanitation in the developing world, weâ€™d be able toâ€¦ [blows raspberry] Thereâ€™s a lot of sweatshop labor out there still, and if we couldâ€¦ [blows raspberry] TimothÃ©e Chalamet threw a boba tea at some Asian guy in Washington Square Park.â€ â€œWait, what? Why did he do that? Does he not like Asian people? Then why is he drinking boba tea? Thatâ€™s, like, an Asian beverage. What are in those gelatinous globules inside a boba tea? I have so many questions.â€ Next day, Chalamet drops a statement. â€œOh, my God. To all my fans and everybody, I didnâ€™t mean to throw that boba tea. I was walking in the park and I slipped, and the boba tea was dislodged from my hand and hit this poor gentleman in the face. I have no ill will to him or anyone in the Asian community or any community. Iâ€™m so deeply sorry.â€ [exhales] â€œI thought he was a good dude.â€ Two days later, though, video leaks of Chalamet. This dude didnâ€™t slip. He was rearing back. He went in on this guy. â€œWhat the fuck? Did you see that clip?â€ â€œYeah, thatâ€™s so messed up. I canâ€™t believe it.â€ â€œDid you see that article that came out today?â€ â€œWhat?â€ â€œThere was another article.â€ â€œWhatâ€™d it say?â€ â€œApparently, that wasnâ€™t Chalamet. It was some other hipster dude and they did a deepfake to make it look like Chalamet.â€ â€œAre you serious?â€ â€œYes!â€ â€œIs he still gonna be in Dune 2?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ â€œWhat should we do?â€ â€œLetâ€™s keep track of this and keep talking about it every day for two weeks, even though it has nothing to do with our lives.â€ And thatâ€™s us, man. We just live in the comments threads now. Doesnâ€™t that feel like the last, like, ten years? We get sucked into one of these loops, weâ€™re in there for a couple weeks, we get out, and weâ€™re on to the next thing, spending all this mental energy on these things that end up going away anyway. Oof. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s weird to me when people are like, â€œOh, the vaccineâ€™s gonna put a microchip in me and turn me into a robot.â€ Itâ€™s like, donâ€™t you realize we already got got? You know, how much more robotic could we be? Donâ€™t you know everything everyoneâ€™s gonna say about everything? You know, they already got us a long time ago, â€™cause these companies making the money were thinking 40, 50 steps ahead. Theyâ€™re way savvier than we give them credit for. Like China. China doesnâ€™t go, â€œHey, weâ€™re working on facial recognition technology and we need your face.â€ No, â€™cause everyone would be like, â€œNo way, China. Iâ€™m not giving you my face. See, my face is my rights.â€ But China doesnâ€™t ask like that. China goes, â€œHey, wanna see what youâ€™d look like when youâ€™re old?â€ [laughing, clapping] â€œMe when Iâ€™m old? Well, yeah! What do I need to do?â€ â€œJust give us your face.â€ â€œOh, cool. Take my face! Take my face! Take my face!â€ Clap if you feel like youâ€™re on the phone or on your Internet too much. Clap if you feel that way. I mean, Iâ€™m clapping with you. That was damn near everybody. I feel it, man. Has anybody done anything to try to curb the amount of phone and Internet time? Raise your hand if youâ€™ve done anything to try to stop yourself a little bit.
What did you do, miss?
I set a time limit. You set the time limit. I know this trick. A little screen time thing. Thing pops up. â€œYouâ€™ve hit your daily limit.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œGet out of here! Iâ€™m still going!â€ That doesnâ€™t work. What else do you guys do? Raise your hands if you do something else. Anything else? What do you do, sir? [person] Deleted Instagram. Deleted Instagram. Yeah, I did that. Like, seven years ago, I deleted all my shit from my phone and everything. I mean, I still have the accounts, but itâ€™s not me, itâ€™s some lady. Umâ€¦ But, you know, I felt this thing. You know what I mean? Iâ€™ve been feeling this for a long time. And Iâ€™ve done all these things you are talking about, and I kept going further and further and further until where, now, I finally feel a little bit better. And you know what I had to do? I had to join Team Flip. [audience exclaims] Team Flip. Itâ€™s a bit extreme, but I tell you what, man. You get your mind back. You can see through the fog. You can go wherever you wanna go. You just gotta write down detailed directions before you leave your house. Itâ€™s tough to get around sometimes. I mean, I canâ€™t do anything on that thing. I can just call people and text, and if I wanna text, I really gotta wanna say what Iâ€™m saying, â€™cause it takes a minute. Iâ€™m on that T9 life. I justâ€¦ I had to let go, you know? It was getting too much for me. I remember one time I had a momentâ€¦ Maybe you had moments like this. I was talking to my mom on the phone, and it was when I had the smartphone and I was on speakerphone, talking to her. And then, um, you know, at some point, I was, like, reading stuff on the Internet and she was like, â€œWhat are you doing? Are you listening to me? Are you reading something?â€ And I was like, â€œYeah.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat are you reading?â€ And I was like, â€œTen things Sean Paul canâ€™t live without.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat? Iâ€™m your mother. Iâ€™m calling you on the phone. Thatâ€™s not very nice.â€ â€œYou wanna know some of the things?â€ I was in my apartment last week and I was looking through these boxes and I found this old videotape and it was footage of me from 20 years ago when Iâ€™d been doing stand-up for just, like, a few weeks. This other NYU kid was doing a documentary about me and it was so wild. I was, like, in my dorm room, writing jokes in a little notebook and I took the NYU bus, came down to Washington Square Park, walked through the park, came down MacDougal Street and walked down those steps right here, and then I came on this stage. This very same spot. This is actually the first place I ever did stand-up in my entire life. And I realized, â€œOh, man, thatâ€™s kind of exactly what I did today.â€ You know? I was in my apartment. I was writing some jokes. I walked all the way down here, got to the cellar. Let the manager knowâ€¦ [imitates button clicking] â€œIâ€™m here.â€ [electronic music plays] How am I doing on time? All right, manâ€™s giving me the twirl, so I guess I gotâ€¦
[audience] Aw.
They want more! They want more. [clapping] Ay, ay, ay, actually, if you really want more, Iâ€™m running out of friends and I gotta bring three people every week. My name is Aziz. Come backâ€¦ When, next week?
Next week, say youâ€™re here to see Aziz.
[audience applauds, cheers]
[mid tempo electronic music plays]
<END>

<START>
Thank you! Thank you! Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Aw, thank you so much. Thank you.
Awâ€¦ Thatâ€™s so nice. That almost makes me forget weâ€™re all gonna be dead in a week. Iâ€™m kidding. Itâ€™ll probably be a month.
Remember when we thought the pandemic was over? Everyone was so happy. â€œWe did it!â€ We probably looked so stupid. Everyone was patting themselves on the back. â€œYou know, Iâ€™m just glad I could help out the sick, by staying inside.â€ â€œItâ€™s not over? Well, Iâ€™m not going back in.â€ â€œThose sick people have to die.â€ â€˜Cause itâ€™s not over. The pandemic is like a TV show you thought was canceled, and then it got picked up by Netflix. Ohâ€¦ I didnâ€™t really pace myself for another season.
I donâ€™t know about you, I wasnâ€™t planning on seeing my family ever again. Parents know the feeling. Itâ€™s like changing that diaper in the middle of the night. Youâ€™re exhausted. Itâ€™s disgusting. But you have to do it. So you change the diaper, you finally get the sleeper back on, and as you gently lay the baby back in the crib, you hear the diaper fill up again. And thatâ€™s what the year 2021 is. Over and over. Itâ€™s just a diaper filling up over and over.
I kind of miss the early days of the pandemic. Those were fun. Back when we thought washing our hands would protect us. â€œEveryone, wash your hands. Weâ€™ll be fine.â€ â€œOkay.â€ Remember before there were readily available tests, everyone had that friend that used to brag â€œYeah, I already had COVID.â€ â€œI had it back in â€™91.â€ â€œYeah. Back then, it was called COVID-91.â€ â€œHad it a couple times. Got rid of it by washing my hands.â€
â€˜Cause the symptoms were confusing. Theyâ€™re still confusing. Itâ€™s like, â€œWhat are the symptoms?â€ â€œEverything.â€ â€œWhat do you mean, everything?â€ â€œAsking a question is a symptom.â€ â€œWell, that canâ€™t be true.â€ â€œDenial is a major symptom.â€ Did you wipe down your groceries? I did that. It felt so silly. You know, like, â€œIâ€™m just a normal guy cleaning a Triscuit box.â€ â€œIs this what OCD feels like?â€ Couple weeks later, youâ€™re like, â€œNah, they look clean to me.â€ â€œI cleaned â€™em.â€
But you had to take the precautions. There was no uniformity. Everyone talked a big game, right? â€œOh, weâ€™re on lockdown.â€ â€œNo work, no school, you know.â€ â€œWe got our bubble.â€ â€œBubbleâ€™s just my family and these two people we see at a weekly sex party.â€ â€œI figured, better safe than sorry.â€
â€˜Cause we all went through the same pandemic, but we didnâ€™t have the same experience, right? There were factors. Like, if you were 25 and healthy, youâ€™re like, â€œWhatever. Iâ€™m going on a COVID cruise.â€ But if you were over the age of 25â€¦ And it may surprise you, but I amâ€¦ â€¦you watched the news more closely, right? The news guys would be like, â€œHigh-risk people are older.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œWell, how old?â€ â€œLike old old, or didnâ€™t-have-a-cellphone-in-high-school old?â€ Right? â€˜Cause nobody thinks of themselves as old.
The reality of your age just occasionally slaps you across the face. I did this benefit for a hospital. It was a fancy event. When I showed up, the woman running the event was like, â€œOh, my gosh. We went to the same college.â€ She was younger, but we talked and we realized we hung out at the same places. At the end of the event, I was leaving and she ran up to me, she was like, â€œI need to know what year you graduated college.â€ I was like, â€œ1988.â€ And she was like, â€œOh, my gosh. Thatâ€™s the year I was born.â€ Slap! Right across the face. I didnâ€™t even know what to say. I was like, â€œAh, thatâ€™s the year I was born too.â€ She looked at me like, â€œThatâ€™s not funny.â€ And then I got in my car and stuffed food in my mouth until I stopped feeling anything.
Sometimes you had to decipher the news. Right? The newscaster would be like, â€œThe vulnerable are older and people with comorbidities.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œCo what?â€ â€œComorbidity.â€ Which eventually we figured out was just code for, â€œAll the fat asses are gonna die.â€ But they couldnâ€™t say that on the news. They couldnâ€™t have Sanjay Gupta be like, â€œWell, Anderson, all the fat asses are gonna die.â€ So they said comorbidities. And at home, we were like, â€œHoney, what is a comorbâ€¦â€ â€œI donâ€™t know. Pass the gravy.â€ In time, we figured out they were talking about fat people. And if you were overweight, you were like, â€œHow fat?â€ Or like, â€œAre we talking Walmart fat or Jim Gaffigan fat?â€
I got the message. I dunno, I totally got the message. I started working out. I started eating healthy. I was going good. Then one day I looked in the mirror and I was like, â€œAh, enough of that.â€ Turns out, life or death, not the motivator youâ€™d think it would be. â€œYou could live longer.â€ â€œNot a good enough reason.â€ â€œCan you sweeten the deal, maybe throw in a pizza?â€ I tried. I tried.
My wife bought me a scale, so the romance is still alive. I didnâ€™t ask for it. She gave it to me as a gift. I could never do something like that. â€œHappy birthday, honey. I bought you a scale and some makeup.â€ â€œJust lookinâ€™ out for you, sweetie.â€ Itâ€™s a high-tech scale. Comes with an app so the government can know how overweight I am. I donâ€™t know why thereâ€™s an app. Maybe so I can be the victim of Ransomware. â€œPay up or weâ€™re telling everyone how fat you are.â€ â€œBut I donâ€™t have any crypto currency.â€ I set up the app, stood on the scale, my weight showed up on the phone, 150 pounds. All right, it was over 200. All right, it was way over 200. If it was an old-fashioned scale, you wouldnâ€™t see the number 200. But it was in the 200 family. And underneath my weight, on the phone, there was this word in small red lettering. I didnâ€™t have my glasses on so I asked my daughter. I was like, â€œWhat does that say?â€ She was like, â€œObese.â€ Slap! Right across the face. I just looked at my daughter, Iâ€™m like, â€œAh, I gotta update this app.â€ And then I ran to the kitchen and stuffed food in my mouth till I stopped feeling anything.
Still wearing masks. There was that time when nobody had to wear a mask, right? That was a fun day. Remember the first time you went out in public without a mask? It was weird, right? You felt naked. You were like, â€œOh, Iâ€™m so European.â€ â€œWhat is this, the French Riviera?â€ I was kind of tempted to wear, like, a thong mask. You know, something tasteful yet naughty. â€œI can see his cheeks, but thereâ€™s still a mystery.â€ â€œOoh-la-la.â€
â™ª Round and pale and mostly balding â™ª â™ª The boy from Indiana goes walking â™ª â™ª And as he does All the people he pass go â™ª â™ª â€œYuck!â€ â™ª
Initially, it was strange seeing other peopleâ€™s faces without a mask. You wanted to go up to some people like, â€œYou should stick with the mask.â€ â€œItâ€™s a better look for you. You in a mask is better for everyone.â€ Did you meet anyone during the pandemic where you only knew them with a mask? And then when you finally saw them barefaced, youâ€™re like, â€œYikes.â€ You felt like you were catfished. Youâ€™re like, â€œWow, your face doesnâ€™t match your voice at all.â€ â€œAnd who stole your chin?â€
Of course, the biggest reveal of the pandemic was how many crazy people there are. That was a bit of a surprise. We all knew there were some Unabombers out there, but, nobody thought there were that many. Or that we were related to a couple of them. You know? â€˜Cause everyone had that relative or friend that came out as bonkers. â€œI no longer believe in reality.â€ â€œGood to know.â€ It was like a gender reveal for insanity. â€œThe truth is no longer true.â€ â€œSee you at Thanksgiving.â€
I feel like it happened for me more often â€™cause Iâ€™ve always had friends that are eccentric thinkers and theyâ€™re normally really entertaining. Theyâ€™re like, â€œBigfootâ€™s real, man. Bigfoot is real.â€ But that same person, at one point during the pandemic, was like, â€œTom Hanks eats babies.â€ â€œDonâ€™t say that.â€ â€œTom Hanks does eat babies.â€ â€œAnd if you donâ€™t believe that, then you eat babies.â€ â€œAll right.â€ â€œTom Hanks eats babies.â€ â€œHe always seemed like a baby-eater to me.â€
The thing I missed most during the lockdown was restaurants. I know thatâ€™s a surprise. I didnâ€™t even realize how much I missed restaurants â€™til the first time I went out to eat and I caught myself catcalling other peopleâ€™s food. â€œOh, yeah.â€ â€œWhat I would do to you.â€ â€œGet me a fork and knife.â€ â€œJim, youâ€™re in public.â€ â€œOh, sorry.â€
This is gonna kind of sound pandering, but I believe the pandemic has been hardest on mothers. Definitely hardest on mothers. Right? Or the men who had to live with those mothers. It was insane forâ€¦ I donâ€™t know how my wife did it.
We had five children doing distance-learning. And my kids were good. They totally kept a distance from learning. We asked children to do school on the same device they play Minecraft. Itâ€™s like holding a Weight Watchers meeting in a Wendyâ€™s. I mean, it was insane. I definitely gained an appreciation for how difficult it is to be a teacher. And what a poor career choice that was. Right?
I guess it was, uh, after the first case of Scotch, I turned to my wifeâ€¦ â€¦and I said, â€œWhen this is over, if thereâ€™s even an opening, Iâ€™ll take you wherever you wanna go. Wherever you wanna go.â€ My wife was like, â€œI want to go to Hawaii.â€ And I was like, â€œI was thinking more Tri-State area.â€ She was like, â€œI wanna go to Hawaii and I wanna bring the kids.â€ And I was like, â€œWhose kids?â€ She was like, â€œOur kids.â€ I did the research, saw that it was cheaper than a divorce, so we went to Hawaii. Andâ€¦ Hawaii is such a special place. It really is. Itâ€™s like thereâ€™s the â€œAloha Spiritâ€, where people greet each other with â€œAloha,â€ but Iâ€™m so awkward, so theyâ€™ll be like, â€œAloha,â€ and Iâ€™ll be like, â€œHello ha.â€ Does that mean something? That meansâ€¦
Even when I would use the Hawaiian terms properly, it would backfire. Like if I said, â€œMahalo,â€ the natives would look at me like, â€œYou donâ€™t have to do that.â€ â€œJust nod your head and weâ€™ll bring you pork.â€
â€˜Cause I stuck out in Hawaii. I didnâ€™t even look like a tourist. I looked like someone they brought in to make the tourists feel more comfortable. â€œYouâ€™re fine. You wanna see awkward, look at Jim Gaffigan.â€
Hawaii, itâ€™s incomparable to any other state. Itâ€™s a tropical paradise. Itâ€™s almost like Hawaii was this Polynesian island nation that we just took over. You know what I mean? Like, it wasnâ€™t even part of the United States. We just went in like it was an open house. â€œNice. Nice.â€ â€œWe could do our honeymoon here. Weâ€™ll take it.â€ The Hawaiians were like, â€œWeâ€™re our own country.â€ â€œThatâ€™s cute. I love your flower shirt. Gotta get one of them.â€ And Hawaiians will tell you, theyâ€™ll come right up to you. Theyâ€™ll be, â€œYou stole this land.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œDonâ€™t know how to break it to you, but we stole all the land.â€ â€œProbably just stings a little more â€™cause itâ€™s pretty here.â€ â€œBelieve me, thereâ€™s people in Detroit pissed at us.â€
My wife chose Hawaii because my wife loves the beach. And as you can see, so do I. I spent the entire time applying and re-applying sunscreen which, thankfully, makes my skin whiter. What cruel bastard decided that the goo that protects pale people from the sun should also make them look like White Walkers? Itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s just cruel. They should offer other colors. â€œCool. Thereâ€™s one of the guys from Blue Man Group.â€ I donâ€™t even know why sunscreen is white. What was the thinking? â€œWell, you know, those pale people love ranch dressing, soâ€¦â€ â€œâ€¦letâ€™s keep it in their wheelhouse.â€ â€˜Cause I donâ€™t tan. I donâ€™t kind of tan. Thereâ€™s no medium rare for me. I either look like Iâ€™ve never been outside, or I was just released from a burn unit. Thereâ€™s no in-between.
And I know people go to the beach to relax. People find the beach very relaxing. Not so much for me. Itâ€™s like being allergic to bees and then, for vacation, becoming a beekeeper. My one goal was to just not burn. I didnâ€™t want to be the sunburned adult. You see a kid with a sunburn, youâ€™re like, â€œParenting is hard.â€ You see an adult with a sunburn, youâ€™re like, â€œThatâ€™s an alcoholic.â€ Right? â€˜Causeâ€¦ A sunburn on an adult is like a scarlet letter for poor judgment. There is no excuse. â€œWell, I was caught off-guard this time.â€ â€œI didnâ€™t know the fireball in the sky would be hot this time.â€
When we werenâ€™t at the beach, we did activities. I went zip-lining for the last time. What is wrong with us? â€œHey, you wanna feel like youâ€™re about to die?â€ â€œWould you pay 200 dollars to feel like youâ€™re about to die six times?â€ Why donâ€™t you just walk into traffic? â€œDid you see that bus almost hit me? I feel so alive.â€ Why donâ€™t you just take off your mask at a biker rally? You know? If youâ€™ve been zip-lining, you know to slow down, you have to spread out your arms and legs. That supposedly slows you down. It also makes it look like a suicide. â€œOh, if he didnâ€™t wanna die, why was he doing the chalk outline?â€ Itâ€™s such a weirdâ€¦ How did they even come up with zip-lining? â€œHey, you know how telephone poles have a wire between â€™em?â€ â€œWhat if we just put the tourists up there?â€ â€œWhy would tourists do that?â€ â€œDonâ€™t know. Why would they pay to swim with sharks?â€
We did go snorkeling. I wasnâ€™t worried for myself â€™cause I figured sharks would look at my legs and be like, â€œThose canâ€™t be real.â€ â€œIâ€™m not gonna bite into another mannequin, thatâ€™s for sure.â€
Sometimes, when my family would go to the beach, Iâ€™d go for a hike by myself, which was boring, but I figured how to make it fun. I started bringing a ketchup packet, and halfway through the hike, Iâ€™d open up the ketchup packet and rub it on my hands and my face, then Iâ€™d just approach romantic couples. â€œHave you seen my wife?â€ â€œNo.â€ â€œBut you heard her sassing off to me, right?â€ â€œI can still smell her sin.â€ â€œJim, that jokeâ€™s scary.â€ â€œThatâ€™s a scary joke.â€
The pandemic continues, but weâ€™reâ€¦ weâ€™re also processing part of the pandemic. We went a year and a half with no weddings, no kidsâ€™ birthday parties, no family reunions, but it wasnâ€™t all good news. Right? Right? Huh? Some thingsâ€¦ I donâ€™t think some things are coming back. Like parades. I think that might be a wrap on parades. There was never anything that impressive about a parade. Youâ€™re all like, â€œHey, kids, look. People areâ€¦ walking.â€ â€œCreating unnecessary traffic.â€ Before the pandemic, if you ran into a parade, you were never like, â€œOh, cool, a parade.â€ You were always kind of like, â€œI hate humans.â€ The only people really enjoying the parade were the people marching in the parade. Even the people on the sidewalk were like, â€œHow long is this?â€ Of course, the highlight of most parades is the marching band, right? And on TV, that birdâ€™s-eye view of the marching band is so impressive, right? But on a street level, you always felt like you were being invaded by nerds. â€œUh-oh. Here they come. Hide your Xbox.â€
But marching bands are amazing, right? They practice as much as the athletes. Theyâ€™re always rehearsing. Itâ€™s amazing how much effort goes into creating something that no one really likes. Iâ€™m kidding. I know thereâ€™s some marching band people here and itâ€¦ And then for thoseâ€¦ You know, likeâ€¦ The reality is, a marching band can take a songâ€¦ Itâ€™s pretty impressiveâ€¦ any song, and ruin it. You know, like, â€œWow, I didnâ€™t know I could hate â€˜Uptown Funkâ€™ that much.â€ Youâ€™re never listening to a song and think, â€œI wish there was a marching band version of this.â€ And I understand thereâ€™s some proud marching band people here. And in full disclosure, I could never be in a marching band â€™cause Iâ€™ve had sex. â€œHeâ€™sâ€¦ Heâ€™s gonna get beat up by a marching band.â€ No, I know that people cherish their time in the marching band, they do. But to me, it just seems like weâ€™re dissuading careers in music. Itâ€™s like, â€œOh, you wanna be a musician? Okay.â€ â€œPut on this Captain Crunch costume.â€ â€œAt halftime, march around the field while we grab some hot dogs.â€ â€œDo that for a couple semesters, then weâ€™ll see if you still wanna be a musician.â€
Did you know thatâ€¦? I didnâ€™t know this. Marching bands started as military bands. They would march armies into battle, and they were for morale and to intimidate the enemy. I donâ€™t know how that would work. â€œOh, no. They know Fleetwood Mac.â€ â€œShould we go back?â€ â€œWhat if Lindsey Buckingham is with them?â€ How did they convince someone playing a trumpet to march into battleâ€¦ â€œHead on in there.â€ â€œWonâ€™t they have weapons?â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna fight them with music.â€ â€œIf you survive, please wake us up in the morning with aâ€¦â€ I love it when trumpet players have the plunger at the end. Who came up with that? â€œYou know, I was listening to you play the trumpet and it reminded me of when I clogged my toilet.â€ â€œIâ€™d eaten six Big Macs on a dare, anyway.â€ â€œUh, I brought my plunger. Itâ€™s kind of clean.â€ â€œIf you could place it at the end of your expensive music equipment, and give me a â€˜wah-wah.'â€ â€œGo ahead.â€ â€œHave you ever thought of becoming a plumber?â€
Itâ€™s ridiculous. People always know someone who looks like me. Wherever I go, once a week, someone will come up to me and go, â€œHey, I know someone that looks like you.â€ I never know what to say. â€œWell, tell him â€˜Hi.'â€ â€œEncourage them to wear sunscreen.â€ And this person who looks like me never doing something impressive with their life. â€œYeah, he mows our lawn.â€ â€œWe donâ€™t even pay him. He just does it.â€ That sounds like my gene pool. Occasionally, on social media, Iâ€™ll be sent photos of babies who supposedly look like me. â€œThis baby looks like Jim Gaffigan.â€ People think itâ€™s hysterical that I look like a pale, pudgy, bald infant who poops in a diaper. Sometimes, people get too cute. Theyâ€™re like, â€œHey, why does our baby son look like Jim Gaffigan?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œâ€˜Cause I slept with your wife.â€
Now if you think itâ€™s humiliating to be told you look like a baby, you should know Iâ€™ve also been sent photos of cats that supposedlyâ€¦ â€¦look like me. Not once or twice, weâ€™re talking about dozens of different cats. Always the same message. â€œThis cat looks like Jim Gaffigan.â€ I donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re implying, you know. That I fathered a cat out of wedlock? When I was lonely after a show so I went for a walk andâ€¦ an alley cat asked for a cigarette andâ€¦ I said I donâ€™t smoke andâ€¦ well, we started talking andâ€¦ before you know it, the sun was coming up. I never saw that cat again. I can still smell her dander. Now, if you think itâ€™s humiliating to be told you look like a baby or a cat, you should know I was once sent a photo of someoneâ€™s kneecapâ€¦ â€¦with the message, â€œThis kneecap looks like Jim Gaffigan.â€ â€“ And you know what? â€“ I did look like that kneecap. But I donâ€™t know what they were implying, you know. That I fathered a kneecap out of wedlock? That I was lonely after a show andâ€¦ I went for a walk and a kneecap asked for a cigarette andâ€¦ and I said I donâ€™t smoke andâ€¦ we started talking. Before you know it, the sun was coming up. I never saw that kneecap again. Now, if you think itâ€™s humiliatingâ€¦ â€¦to be told you look like the fleshy, wrinkly part of a strangerâ€™s legâ€¦ it is. Or, uh, you know, I thought it was. And then I had this realization. I figured out what had happened. You know, it all made sense. There might be one person in here thatâ€™s like, â€œJim, youâ€™re crazy.â€ But I think the rest of you will see the logic here. What happened is, this kneecap person, obviously, went to a plastic surgeonâ€¦ Right? And said, â€œI would like my kneecap to look like the most underrated comedian in America.â€ Right? And the plastic surgeon said, â€œYou mean John Mulaney?â€ And the kneecap person said, â€œNo, Jim Gaffigan.â€ And the plastic surgeon said, â€œI donâ€™t know who that is.â€ And then the kneecap person said, â€œHeâ€™s kind of a pale, pudgy guy who looks like a baby or a cat.â€ Thatâ€™s probably what happened.
Thatâ€™s weird. I normally get told I look like other humans though. I, uhâ€¦ In Utah, I always get told I look Mormon. I didnâ€™t even know you could look like a religion. But apparently, I do. And Iâ€™ve done research. I donâ€™t look like one of the founders of the Mormons. I donâ€™t look like a present leader of the Mormons. I donâ€™t even look like a guy who could have more than one wife. I just somehow look Mormon. Of course, the Mormons no longer practice polygamy. But for a while there, a Mormon man could have more than one wife. I donâ€™t know if that was a selling point. â€˜Cause I love my wife, and I can honestly say I donâ€™t want another one. I feel like disappointing one person is enough. Could you imagine having two spouses mad at you? And you couldnâ€™t drink coffee? No, thanks.
I hope it doesnâ€™t sound like Iâ€™m picking on Mormons. Most organized religions have negative stereotypes. Luckily, Iâ€™m Catholic, so I donâ€™t have to worry about that, all right. Sometimes people donâ€™t believe me. Like, â€œAre you really Catholic?â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™m just saying that to impress you.â€ â€œI wanna come across like I have good judgment.â€
At this point, itâ€™s almost like Catholics are trying to lose followers. Theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat else can we do? What else?â€ â€œWhy donâ€™t we make Bill Cosby pope? Letâ€™s try that.â€ Catholics have made an art of shrinking their religion. Even back to the Great Schism of 1054 where the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholics split apart, the Orthodox were like, â€œWe wanna celebrate Christmas in January.â€ And the Catholics were like, â€œWe like pedophiles.â€ I know. That oneâ€™s hard for me too. And then there was the, uh, Protestant Reformation. You didnâ€™t even know this is a religion history class, did you? No, there was the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s when Martin Luther, who probably thought heâ€™d be the most famous Martin Lutherâ€¦ Right? He was like, â€œThatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m the king of Martin Luthers.â€ â€œDonâ€™t be surprised if one day, I get my own holiday.â€ No, Martin Luther, he had those 95 problems, but a bitch ainâ€™t one, right? â€˜Cause at the time, the Catholic church was super corrupt. Thankfully, itâ€™s not anymore.
Some Catholics get really angry. â€œYouâ€™re so critical of Catholic church, why you even Catholic?â€ Because I believe human beings are inherently flawed. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons. But mainly, Iâ€™m afraid of my wife. Huh?
I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything intrinsically wrong with organized religion. Itâ€™s just the human interpretation, right? Most organized religions, Godâ€™s saying a similar thing. Heâ€™s like, â€œI want you to love one another.â€ And the humans are like, â€œGot it, got it. He said kill gay people, soâ€¦â€ â€œLetâ€™s get to work.â€
As a result, all organized religions are struggling right now. Muslims, theyâ€™re killing it. Muslims are like, â€œOh, Catholics, you think you can alienate people?â€ â€œHold my hummus.â€ â€œLet me show you how itâ€™s done.â€
Iâ€™m sure some of you are looking at me like, â€œHey, Jim, you look like a former Hitler Youth.â€ â€œWhat are your views on Judaism?â€ â€œIâ€™d like to see you destroy your career tonight.â€ Well, Iâ€™m not frightened. Iâ€™ll tell you what I think. I think Judaism is perfect. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with it. And Iâ€™d like to be in more feature films. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s some, uhâ€¦ Thatâ€™s some good old-fashioned pandering anti-Semitism.
Really, the only organized religion, without a negative stereotype, is Buddhism. Right? Youâ€™d think more Americans would be Buddhists. â€˜Cause if you look at Buddha, he kind of looks like an American. Buddha looks like someone youâ€™d watch the game with. â€œBuddha always gets a keg for the playoffs.â€ â€œBuddha! Buddha!â€ You know, in real life, Buddha was thin. He wasnâ€™t even a big guy. They made him heavy to make the religion more appealing. â€˜Cause at that time, being heavy was a sign of success. Also at that time, being lighter-skinned was a sign of success. So back then, I would have been like Jeff Bezos, soâ€¦
Bezos. Whoâ€™s your favorite billionaire-pretend astronaut? Hmm? Can you believe thereâ€™s a choice? And itâ€™s not between just two. We live in a day when billionaires are building their own rockets to fly to outer space, and no oneâ€™s saying, â€œAre you sure theyâ€™re paying all their taxes?â€ â€œâ€˜Cause I know some teachers that need supplies.â€ Itâ€™s like these billionaires are trying to execute the plan of a five-year-old boy. â€œWhen I grow up, Iâ€™m gonna be a bazillionaire!â€ â€œAnd Iâ€™m gonna build my own spaceship!â€ â€œAnd fly to outer space!â€ â€œOkay, Jeffrey.â€ â€œBut now itâ€™s time for bed.â€
I almost feel sorry for the accountants of the billionaires. â€˜Cause they were like, â€œYou had an amazing year.â€ â€œYou made 40 billion dollars.â€ â€œBut I fudged the numbers so it looks like you broke even.â€ â€œAs long as you lay low and donâ€™t draw attention, we should be fine.â€ â€œYou got anything coming up?â€ â€œI built a rocketâ€¦â€ â€œâ€¦to fly to outer space.â€ â€œYou know I meant to lay low on this planet.â€ â€œDoes it matter if the rocketâ€™s shaped like a penis?â€
I do enjoy the reasoning of the billionaires for going to space. Theyâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m going to outer space so eventually you can go to outer space.â€ â€œIâ€™m going so you can go.â€ â€œI donâ€™t wanna go to outer space.â€ â€œI wanna go to Italy.â€ Why donâ€™t you work on that?
I saw a hitchhiker recently. You never see that anymore. Of course, we no longer refer to them as â€œhitchhikers.â€ Now we call them â€œmurderersâ€. Which is what they do. They murder the nice people that give them rides. Talk about a lack of gratitude. â€œThanks for picking me up.â€ Stab.
Hitchhiking disappeared â€™cause it was dangerous for both participants. Right? The hitchhiker and the driver. And, you know, at one point, there must have been like a murderer driving around looking to pick up a hitchhiker, and he picked up a hitchhiker who was also a murderer. And the driver was like, â€œIâ€™m gonna kill you.â€ And the hitchhiker was like, â€œIâ€™m gonna kill you.â€ And I bet they had a laugh. I bet they laughed. And then slowly but surely, â€œthey fell in love.â€ â€œAnd thatâ€™s what my musicalâ€™s about.â€ Itâ€™s called Hitched.
Flew in Thursday, uh, driving from the airport, I saw this guy on a motorcycle and he looked so happy. You know, and whenever I see a motorcycle thatâ€™s on the highway, I always have the same thought. â€œYouâ€™re gonna die.â€ â€œWhat are you doing on the highway? Youâ€™re gonna die.â€ And the only reason I say that is â€™cause theyâ€™re gonna die. I donâ€™t even know what the thinking is. â€œWell, I have to travel a long distance.â€ â€œShould I take the car or this motorized chair with no seat belt?â€ â€œIf I sneeze, Iâ€™ll never walk again.â€ â€œLive to ride.â€ And then die!
I heard the motorcycle before I saw it. Weâ€™ve all heard those loud motorcycles. â€œWow, how small is his penis?â€ And I didnâ€™t know thatâ€™s the reason some motorcycles are so loud is â€™cause they want you to know theyâ€™re gonna die.
I have friends that love motorcycles. Some women are really into bikers. Theyâ€™re like, â€œI just like a man whoâ€™s dangerous, who canâ€™t afford a car.â€ â€œAnd whoâ€™s definitely gonna die.â€
But bikers are fascinating, right? What a uniquely American subculture. Theyâ€™re all about macho independence, right? Theyâ€™re all about the independence. Like, â€œI just wanna be out on the road, just me and my bike, alone, with 30 other guys.â€ â€œIn matching outfits.â€ â€œRiding in tandem so close, we can French-kiss each other.â€ Heâ€™s gonna get beat up by a marching band and a gang of bikers.
Bikers are grown men who make the same phone calls of an eight-year-old boy. â€œYou guys wanna ride bikes tonight?â€ â€œWell, I donâ€™t wanna go alone. Itâ€™s scary out there. Ask your mommy.â€
The reason thatâ€™s funny is â€™cause bikers are so intimidating, right? Theyâ€™re angry. Bikers seem angry, and I think itâ€™s â€™cause theyâ€™re cold. Right? That vest with no shirt? Thatâ€™s gotta be chilly. â€œOh, I wish I had a shawl.â€ â€œShawl and my Uggs.â€ â€œMaybe a pumpkin spice latte.â€ That vest with no shirt is so common among bikers. Is there like peer pressure? â€œLook at Curtis over there, wearing a T-shirt under his vest like a girl.â€ â€œLetâ€™s kick his ass.â€ â€œAnd then kiss him.â€
Occasionally, youâ€™ll see a biker giving someone a ride on the back of their motorcycle, itâ€™s usually a woman. Guys donâ€™t wanna ride on the back. Mm. Itâ€™s hard to get a ride on the back of a motorcycle without giving an extended intimate hug. â€œLetâ€™s get out of here, Virgil.â€ â€œYou smell wonderful, Virgil.â€ â€œWhat is that, lilac?â€ â€œYouâ€™ve been doing sit-ups, Virgil?â€
During the summer, occasionally, youâ€™ll see a bicyclist on the highway. See a cyclist on the highway, theyâ€™re always dressed like theyâ€™re competing in the Tour de France. â€œYouâ€™re losing!â€ â€œAnd youâ€™re also gonna die.â€
Those bicyclists, they have to settle down with the helmet design. Itâ€™s all super aerodynamic. Itâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re not going that fast.â€ Youâ€™re riding a bike. Youâ€™re not in the movie Tron. And put on some clothes! Whatâ€™s with the spandex? Are you on your way to wrestle Blue Man Group? How many Blue Man references youâ€™re gonna have?
You ever see a bicyclist on the highway and theyâ€™re not in spandex, theyâ€™re just in regular clothes? They look like they have a DUI. Shouldâ€™ve Ubered.
You never see a cyclist giving someone a ride, right? Thereâ€™s no room. Theyâ€™re already sitting on that door handle of a seat. â€œIâ€™m just gonna sit here for five hours.â€ â€œI donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t have children.â€ Right, Iâ€™m going after the cyclist. What are they gonna do? Throw their baby bottle of water at me? â€œIâ€™d chase you, but for no reason at all, Iâ€™m wearing cleats.â€ Are those cleats necessary? Youâ€™re in a Starbucks. â€œDo you have oat milk?â€
I think itâ€™s interesting, people who ride bicycles are called â€œcyclists,â€ but people who ride motorcycles are called â€œbikersâ€? You know, thatâ€™s just the bikers bullying the cyclists. â€œHey, weâ€™re gonna take the name â€˜biker.â€™ You canâ€™t use it.â€ And the cyclist went, â€œMotorcycle doesnâ€™t even have the word â€˜bikeâ€™ in it.â€ â€œWe donâ€™t care.â€ â€œAlso, weâ€™re gonna dress like that guy from the Village People.â€ Sun-glass guyâ€™s like, â€œWell, we were gonna do that.â€ â€œNo, youâ€™re gonna dress like rhythmic gymnasts.â€ â€œOkay.â€
Bikers and cyclists both dress like theyâ€™re on their way to a costume party. No other form of transportation has a uniform. You never see everyone on the cruise ship dress like pirates â€™cause itâ€™s not necessary. Bikers and cyclists, both on two wheels, nothing in common. Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re trying to be different. Even the placement of the handlebarsâ€¦ Some cyclists have handlebars in real tight, some bikers have their handlebars way up here. â€œOh, this is comfortable.â€ â€œThis reminds me of my Big Wheel.â€ â€œNow I know why I have my wallet on a chain.â€
You never see a unicyclist on the highway. You know why? â€˜Cause theyâ€™re all dead. â€˜Cause I killed them. Youâ€™re welcome. Is there any bigger attention-grab than riding a unicycle? I guess a pogo stick, right? What was the pitch for the pogo stick? â€œItâ€™s a stick you can jump on twice and then fall on your face.â€ â€œInteresting. If you practice, do you get better?â€ â€œNot at all, no.â€ â€œIâ€™ll take one.â€
But unicyclists, they act like they donâ€™t want the attention. They always have that super casual look on their face, but their legs are so frantic. Theyâ€™re always likeâ€¦ â€œOh, hey, whatâ€™s going on, everyone?â€ â€œOh, Iâ€™m not doing anything.â€ â€œDoes anyone have three bowling pins I could juggle?â€ â€œI could annoy you with two unnecessary skills.â€ That joke takes way too much effort.
Oh, you may have noticed that thereâ€™s a piano on stage. And, uh, some of you may be wondering, â€œHey, why would Jim Gaffigan have a piano on stage?â€ Andâ€¦ What you may not realize is that Iâ€¦ do not play the piano. â€œJim, that wasâ€¦â€ â€œReally? Did he bring the piano just for that joke?â€ â€œThatâ€™s pathetic.â€
Good-looking crowd here. Wow. Very good-looking. Very good-looking crowd, huh? Well, not all of you, you know. Not all of you. But Iâ€™m not breaking any news, right? We know where we stand. Yeah, we learn from such an early age. Like, I remember kindergarten, the girls would chase the cute boys at recess, and letâ€™s just say I didnâ€™t do a lot of running. Or any running. I remember being five years old and going, â€œOh, this is how itâ€™s gonna be.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna have to write some jokes.â€ â€œAnd Iâ€™ll be hanging out with the fellas.â€
I still hang out with the fellas. All right, I had a friend during the lockdown who spent the entire time planning a guysâ€™ weekend. Every time I talk to him, he would make it sound less appealing. â€œDude, this is what weâ€™re gonna do.â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna rent a cabin for the weekend. Just guys, no women.â€ â€œIâ€™m already out.â€ â€œNo, no, no. Think about it. Just guys, no women.â€ â€œWeâ€™ll smoke cigars, play poker all weekend.â€ â€œSounds horrible.â€ â€œYouâ€™re not thinking it through.â€ â€œJust guys, no women, for a whole weekend, like weâ€™re in prison.â€ â€œI look forward to it.â€
Every year, my brother Mitch goes on a golfing trip with 30 men. Thirty men. They fly to Florida. They rent three houses. Ten men to a house. They play golf in the morning, they eat lunch together, they play golf in the afternoon, and then they go back to the houses, I donâ€™t know, have sex with each other. I donâ€™t know what they do. It sounds horrible. How much fellowship can you have? My brother is not gay and, obviously, I wouldnâ€™t care if he was. But if he ever came out, he could be like, â€œI gave you so many hints.â€ â€œI literally vacationed with 30 men.â€ â€œWe rented out a cul-de-sac.â€ â€œWe played with sticks and balls all day.â€ â€œHow clear did I have to make it?â€ I guess the point Iâ€™m trying to make is golf makes people gay. Soâ€¦ So the next time a friend says, â€œIâ€™m going to play golf with the fellas,â€ just be like, â€œEnjoy.â€
No, I prefer mixed company. I do, you know. Thereâ€™s a clichÃ© that men are dumb and I have enough male friends to know thatâ€™s based on some truth. Every man in here has that friend that they occasionally look at and wonder how they hold down a job. And if you donâ€™t think that about a friend, that means youâ€™re the friend. Yeah.
My friend like that is Ricky. Heâ€™s a great guy. Ricky and I, one time, we went axe-throwing. Donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve done that. Throw an axe, you drink a beer. You try and forget our democracy is in crisis andâ€¦ At one point, Ricky turned to me and he goes, â€œHey, before axe-throwing, what did they use axes for?â€ â€œUhâ€¦â€ â€œChopping wood?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œReally?â€ And I was like, â€œDonâ€™t talk anymore.â€ And like a good friend, I ran home, turned it into a stand-up bit. And I kind of forgot about it. Then, like a month later, Ricky called me out of the blue and goes, â€œI did it. I did it.â€ â€œI built my own axe-throwing range in my backyard.â€ Yeah, heâ€™s divorced. Andâ€¦ Then he immediately starts bragging. Heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, now, I could throw an axe 20 yards and hit a bullseye.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s impressive.â€ â€œYou know when thatâ€™s gonna come in handy? Never.â€ Heâ€™ll be like, â€œHey, you never know.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, I do know.â€ Even if someone broke in your house and you happen to be holding an axe, youâ€™re not gonna be able to say, â€œHey, can you come 10 feet closer?â€
I like having women around for many reasons, not least of which is, theyâ€™re attractive and men are not. You know? Like when a guyâ€™s good-looking, itâ€™s like a fluke of nature. And you know what all attractive men have in common? They kind of look like women. Right? Thatâ€™s the only way straight guys can tell whoâ€™s good-looking. â€œWow, he must be attractive. He barely looks like a dude.â€
Women are attractive and compared to men, theyâ€™re very clean. Men are gross. And make very little effort to not be gross. Like, if aliens visited Earth, theyâ€™ll be so confused. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œThe attractive feminine gender is taking an hour to get ready and those hairy beasts are just ready?â€ â€œNo wonder this planetâ€™s always at war.â€
Men are gross and as they get older, grosser. When women get older, they become more elegant. As men get older, they look like theyâ€™re decomposing. You ever seen an old guy with the shirt off? He looks like the first draft of a human. What is that, a Simpsons character? Because when men get older, things stop working. The synapses stop connecting. Normally, brainâ€™s like, â€œEvery month, Iâ€™m gonna grow hair on this guyâ€™s head. â€œEvery month, Iâ€™m gonna grow hair on this guyâ€™s head.â€ But one month, the brainâ€™s like, â€œEvery month, Iâ€™m gonna grow hair everywhere but this guyâ€™s head.â€ I have hair growing in parts of my bodyâ€¦ I donâ€™t need. Do you wanna know why older men grow hair on weird parts of their body? Thatâ€™s natureâ€™s way of saying, â€œYouâ€™re done.â€ â€œStop mating or Iâ€™m going to turn you into a throw rug.â€
I have some body hair, not as bad as some men, which is a relief, â€™cause as you can see, I did not win the genetic lottery. I am bald, blind and pale. It wouldnâ€™t surprise me if I woke up tomorrow with a tail. â€œHave you seen the comic with the tail?â€ â€œHeâ€™s very pale and the tail even has a bald spot.â€ I saw a guy this summer at the pool, heâ€™s probably 60, had his shirt off. Not a lot of body hair. All body hair. For a second, I thought they were shooting a GEICO commercial. This guy wasâ€¦ He was so hairy I had to stop my youngest son from trying to pet him. â€œLet him smell your hand first, son.â€ This guy was hairy and he was walking around the pool with the confidence like heâ€™d spent a lifetime dealing with hairy situations. No one said anything, but everyone had the same thought: â€œPlease donâ€™t go in the pool.â€ â€œNo oneâ€™s prepared to see you shake dry.â€ And this man walked right by everyone, and he sat down next to an attractive woman. And I was so impressed. That woman could look beyond this manâ€™s appearance and focus solely on his wallet.
Whoo!
But we all wanna be good-looking, right? We all wanna be chased on the playground, right? Some people go so far as to get plastic surgery. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh, I donâ€™t wanna sound desperate, but can you take a knife to my face?â€ â€œAnd make me pretty. Just keep cutting!â€
Itâ€™s kind of amazing more of us donâ€™t get plastic surgery because we live in a beauty-obsessed society, right? There are studies. There was a Harvard study, that found that children believed good-looking people are nicer. That study also found that children are stupid. We definitely give good-looking people the benefit of the doubt. Like if a really attractive personâ€™s quiet, we think theyâ€™re mysterious. If a fat person is quiet, we assume theyâ€™re thinking about food. And we are, we are, but thereâ€™s still a mystery. You donâ€™t know what kind of food. All right, itâ€™s cake. Itâ€™s always cake. But you donâ€™t know what kind. All right, itâ€™s red velvet.
As a result, we just like being around beautiful people. You ever been out to eat and you have a waiter or waitress thatâ€™s really attractive? For a second, youâ€™re like, â€œWow, this is gonna be a good meal.â€ You ever have an ugly waiter, youâ€™re like, â€œShould we leave?â€ I think thatâ€™s why buffets started. â€œYou know what, Iâ€™ll get my own food. Thank you.â€ â€œI donâ€™t need that mug near my entrÃ©e. You know what I mean?â€ â€œJim, youâ€™re a monster.â€
We follow good-looking people on social media, Instagram. Beautiful people have millions of followers and we like their photos and sometimes, we put a flame emoji. Itâ€™s totally socially acceptable. If you did that in real life, youâ€™d go to jail. â€œExcuse me, sir, what are you doing?â€ â€œIâ€™m following that lady.â€ â€œUh, Can I ask why?â€ â€œI like to look at her.â€ â€œCan you give her this torch I brought her?â€ â€œAnd these prayer hands.â€
Everyoneâ€™s got to settle down with the prayer hands emoji. The overuse is ridiculous. Got a text from a friend, â€œSee you at dinner. Prayer hands.â€ â€œNo. No prayer hands. Are you not gonna make it?â€ â€œWhat are you suggesting? That we eat hands for dinner?â€
My wife is very good-looking. Thatâ€™s right, Iâ€™m part of a mixed couple. Itâ€™s not fair. Sheâ€™s good-looking, sheâ€™s smart, sheâ€™s creative. But you know what? Horrible taste in men. So it evens out. Iâ€™m happily married, but I would say, once a week, I catch my wife giving me a look, like, â€œIâ€™m gonna have to let you go.â€ â€˜Cause I disappoint her constantly. I do things that annoy. Like, hereâ€™s something I do that annoys my wife. I use the bathroom. I know. I shouldnâ€™t, right? I get in trouble for not telling her Iâ€™m gonna use the bathroom. â€œYou just disappeared. Whereâ€™d you go?â€ â€œI didnâ€™t know I needed a hall pass.â€
I also get in trouble for telling her Iâ€™m gonna use the bathroom. â€œUh, Iâ€™m gonna use the bathroom.â€ â€œAgain?â€ â€œAre you okay?â€ â€œHow many times is that today?â€ â€œYouâ€™re disgusting.â€ â€œWhat do you do in there?â€ â€œMostly get away from you.â€
When my wifeâ€™s annoyed with me, she doesnâ€™t give me the silent treatment. Sheâ€™ll just take too long to answer a simple question. Sheâ€™ll be standing a foot away, looking at her phone and Iâ€™ll be like, â€œWhat time do we have to do that school thing?â€ And sheâ€™ll just be likeâ€¦ â€œItâ€™s in the calendar.â€ Iâ€™ll be like, â€œUh, are you mad at me?â€ â€œNo.â€
Recently, we learned that this couple that weâ€™re friends with are getting a divorce. And not surprisingly, my wife was very upset. With me. I wasnâ€™t surprised â€™cause this wasnâ€™t the first time something I had nothing to do with was my fault. Trumpâ€™s election, the Kavanaugh hearings, that was my fault. And I apologize â€™cause I unconsciously planned the whole thing.
Now, I would never describe my wife as crazy, â€™cause I like to be married. But I do think itâ€™s interesting that if a man calls another man crazy, itâ€™s a compliment. â€œHereâ€™s my buddy, Joey. Heâ€™s crazy.â€ Joeyâ€™s like, â€œOh, youâ€™re just being nice.â€ But if I was like, â€œThis is my wife, Jeannie. Sheâ€™s crazy.â€ I even get nervous saying that. Sheâ€™s back in New York, but you never know. â€˜Cause if my wife was standing here and I was like, â€œThis is my wife, sheâ€™s crazy,â€ Iâ€™d be dead. And all of you would applaud. Youâ€™d be like, â€œWell, that was a teachable moment. Yeah.â€ â€œWe learned something.â€ No, weâ€™re hanging in there.
By the way, if at the start of the pandemic, you were in a relationship and youâ€™re still in that relationship, you should get money, right? Right? Because before the pandemic, if youâ€™d hear of a couple splitting up, you were like, â€œOh, no.â€ But during the pandemic, when youâ€™d hear of a break up, youâ€™re like, â€œOh, of course.â€ You felt for the couples that stayed together. â€œYouâ€™re still together? Oh, Iâ€™m sorry to hear that.â€ â€œCo-dependency, huh?â€ â€˜Cause it doesnâ€™t matter how strong your relationship was. At one point during the pandemic, you looked at your partner and thought, â€œI think Iâ€™d rather have the coronavirus.â€
I know that sounds horrible, but itâ€™s true. Everyone had that moment where theyâ€™re like, â€œYou know, how uncomfortable is that ventilator?â€ â€œI know I wouldnâ€™t be able to talk, but does that mean I wouldnâ€™t be able to hear her?â€ â€œDo they have a ventilator just for the ears?â€ â€œJim, youâ€™re a monster.â€
My wifeâ€™s an amazing mother. We have five children. Can you believe that? Five children. Thank you. Thank you. It is something I regretâ€¦ â€¦â€™cause thereâ€™s too many of them. Thereâ€™s way too many. Sometimes at dinner, I just pretend Iâ€™m hosting a reality showâ€¦ â€¦called So You Think Youâ€™re Going To College. â€˜Cause they all canâ€™t go. They all canâ€™t go, not if Iâ€™m getting that boat. Iâ€™m kidding. Obviously, Iâ€™m not getting the boatâ€¦ not until I get a motorcycle, you know.
My kids find me annoying. All children find their parents annoying, which is kind of ironic, given children essentially ruined their parentsâ€™ lives. Right? Parents give their children their time, their energy and their money, and we repay our parents with resentment. Have you ever seen an adult get a phone call from one of their parents? Youâ€™d think it was a debt collector. â€œUgh. Itâ€™s my mom.â€ â€œYeah, I know you took care of me for a quarter of a century, but now is not a good time.â€ â€œYou know what wasnâ€™t a good time? Giving up my dreamsâ€¦ â€¦so you could be a general disappointment.â€
No, I would never suggest that children are Godâ€™s punishment for having sex. But an argument could be made. And heâ€™s up there, â€œOh, theyâ€™re enjoying that way too much.â€ â€œHow can I get them to pray tomorrow?â€
I do love being a parent. Itâ€™s the most important thing Iâ€™ll do in my life. But itâ€™s an insane proposition. You give your children everything. You give them everything and then just one day, they leave. Theyâ€™re like, â€œSee you! Thanks for nothing.â€ â€œIâ€™ll let you know if I need help with a mortgage.â€
Sometimes they donâ€™t leave, right? They just stick around. They turn into roommates. Not going to happen in my house. I already have a backpack for each of them. Theyâ€™ve seen the bags, â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhen you turn 18, thatâ€™s your going-away present.â€ â€œJim, youâ€™re a monster.â€
I try to be a good dad. I feel like I make more of an effort than my father. My dadâ€™s generation, they didnâ€™t have to do anything. My dad never went to a parent-teacher conference. My dad didnâ€™t even know I went to school. My father couldnâ€™t be bothered to turn his head if something was happening behind him. â€œWhat the hellâ€™s going on back there?â€ I donâ€™t know if he couldnâ€™t turn his head or if it wasnâ€™t worth the effort. â€œWhat the hell is going on back there?â€ â€œOh, weâ€™re celebrating my birthday.â€ â€œOh, keep it down. Iâ€™m watching Ironsides.â€
â™ª Happy birthday â™ª â™ª To you â™ª
My children give me guilt trips I wouldnâ€™t even contemplate. Like my daughter was in a play on Thursday and Friday, so I went on Thursday night and then Friday morning, she saw me with my rolly bag and was like, â€œOh, youâ€™re not coming to my show tonight?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYouâ€™ve never been to one of my shows.â€ â€œI do 300 a year.â€
My big plan was to teach my children responsibility by selling posters after one of my shows. So I texted my teenage daughter. Iâ€™m like, â€œDo you wanna sell posters after my show? Iâ€™ll pay you.â€ She texted back, â€œGreat, sounds good.â€ Then I texted my teenage son. â€œDo you want to sell posters after my show? Iâ€™ll pay you.â€ He texted back, â€œNo thanks. I donâ€™t need the money.â€ He doesnâ€™t have any money. He has my money. I just texted back, â€œYouâ€™re out of the will.â€ Iâ€™m kidding. He was never in it.
If my father asked me to do something, he wouldnâ€™t even stick around for an answer. â€œYou wanna shovel the driveway?â€ Then heâ€™d just leave. It was understood I was gonna shovel the driveway or move out.
I was kind of frightened of my dad. My children treat me like some bank teller they reluctantly have to deal with. Once a week, they just appear in front of me. â€œHmmâ€¦ Mom said I could get a sharkâ€¦ â€¦so I guess I need your credit card.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ â€œHeâ€™s yelling again, Mom!â€
If my dad was in a room in the house, I wouldnâ€™t go to that side of the house. â€œIâ€™ll just pee outside.â€ And I had all these older siblings that used to send me in there to ask questions. â€œGo ask Dad if we can go to Dairy Queen.â€ â€œIâ€™m not doing it. Iâ€™m not doing it.â€ â€œGo. Youâ€™re too young to kill.â€ â€œDad?â€ â€œWhat the hell do you want?â€ â€œHe said, no.â€
When I didnâ€™t have kids, I didnâ€™t understand my dad at all. By the way, if you donâ€™t have children, none of this should make sense. Or even the concept of a Saturday night. When you donâ€™t have kids, youâ€™re like, â€œSaturday!â€ And when youâ€™re a parent, youâ€™re like, â€œWho can we pay to come to this houseâ€¦ â€¦and watch this child?â€ And your standards drop so dramatically. Initially, like, â€œThey should have a PhD.â€ And then youâ€™re like, â€œWell, how long were they in jail?â€ â€œMurder? It wasnâ€™t children, right?â€ â€œA Satanist? Youâ€™ll fit right in.â€
Any parent will tell you that, like, having children has enriched their lives. Itâ€™s exposed them to things they never thought theyâ€™d do. Like kids justâ€¦ You end up doing things you never thought youâ€™d do. Like for me, going outside. You ever go outside with real little kids? You donâ€™t even know what to do with them. Youâ€™re like, â€œWell, I normally just drink out here.â€ â€œWho wants to play a game of nap?â€
Itâ€™s weird when your kids have a friend that youâ€™re not a fan of. â€œOh, Tommyâ€™s coming over? Well, Iâ€™ll be leaving.â€ â€œYou can text me when Tommy is goneâ€¦ â€¦â€™cause heâ€™s immature.â€
I wasnâ€™t prepared for all the activities kids have. You pick up your kid and bring them to an activity, then to another activity. And if they donâ€™t have an activity, you have to think of one, or theyâ€™ll smoke meth. Youâ€™re always looking for an activity as a parent. I took my kids to Ripleyâ€™s Believe It or Not. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever been that desperate for something to do. What can I tell you about Ripleyâ€™s Believe It or Not? Itâ€™s mostly not. Itâ€™s not interesting. Itâ€™s not even a lot of stuff. Itâ€™s like they just emptied out some drifterâ€™s storage unit. I do admire that business model, you know. Most businesses attempt to establish trust with the customer. Not Ripleyâ€™s. Like, â€œBelieve itâ€¦ or not. We donâ€™t care.â€ â€œWe know youâ€™re not coming back.â€
Iâ€™m still getting used to having teenagers. Recently, my 17-year-old daughter told me that she wants to be an actor, which is so crazy â€™cause when I was that age, that movie Dead Poets Society came out, which is an amazing movie with Robin Williams, where he plays this teacher who inspires these students to seize the day, right? And one of the students wants to be an actor. And, you know, he joins the play and he invites his dad to see the play and after the play, he tells his dad that he wants to be an actor. Dadâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™re not gonna be an actor, thatâ€™s stupid. Waste of time and moneyâ€¦â€ The kidâ€™s so distraught he kills himself, and then the teacher gets fired and all the kids stand on desksâ€¦ Anyway, itâ€™s a great movie. No, nowâ€¦ now that Iâ€™m the parent of a teenager, I realized that dad in Dead Poets Society was right. Iâ€™m kidding. I know the point of the movie is, â€œDonâ€™t be a teacher.â€ My wife hates that joke so much.
My kids, I donâ€™t know what they think. I donâ€™t even think my kids know what I do for a living. Or I should say I didnâ€™t think they knew what I did for a living till last Halloween. My 10-year-old, Michael, didnâ€™t know what he wanted to be for Halloween, which is a crisis. If youâ€™re a parent, you know this. Then, like, two days before Halloween, he ran up to me and he goes, â€œI know what Iâ€™m gonna be for Halloween.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna be a stand-up comedian.â€ And I was so touched. I was like, â€œOh, my gosh, for Halloween, you wanna be your dad.â€ And he goes, â€œNo, I wanna be John Mulaney.â€ Slap! Right across the face.
Thank you so much, you guys. Appreciate it.
Thatâ€™s Mom and Dad.

â™ª Once upon a time you dressed so fine â™ª â™ª Threw the bums a dime in your prime â™ª â™ª Didnâ€™t you? â™ª
â™ªâ™ª
â™ª People call, say: Beware, doll â™ª â™ª Youâ€™re bound to fall â™ª â™ª You thought they were all â™ª â™ª A-kidding you â™ª
â™ªâ™ª
â™ª You used to laugh about â™ª â™ª Everybody that was hanging out â™ª â™ª Now you donâ€™t talk so loud â™ª â™ª Now you donâ€™t seem so proud â™ª â™ª About having to be scrounging â™ª â™ª Your next meal â™ª â™ª How does it feel â™ª
[Cheering and applause]
â™ª How does it feel â™ª
â™ªâ™ª
â™ª To be without a home â™ª
â™ªâ™ª
â™ª Like a complete unknown â™ª
â™ªâ™ª
â™ª Like a rolling stone â™ª
â™ªâ™ª
[Cheering and applause]
[Chanting] Louis! Louis! Louis!
[Clears throat] [Laughter] Wellâ€¦
[Cheering and applause]
M-myâ€¦ my favorite sex positionâ€¦
[Laughter]
My favorite sexual position is, uh, reverse cowgirlâ€¦ But Iâ€™m on top.
[Laughter]
Are you picturing that? Itâ€™s good. Itâ€™s really good. Nobody gets pregnant. Itâ€™s a lot of fun.
Iâ€™m trying to learn things about myself. Um, I got a scale for my bathroom. Iâ€™m not trying to lose weight, Iâ€™m just interested in the data. [Laughter] And I did learn something, I learned thisâ€¦ Because I weigh myself every night before I go to bed; and then I also weigh myself on the morning when I get up and Iâ€¦ Hereâ€™s what I learnedâ€¦ I weigh two pounds less every morning than when I went to bedâ€¦ And I found out why, itâ€™s because I shit in my bed every night. [Laughter] I doâ€¦ I take a full two-pound dump in bed, and then I turn out the lights and I go to sleep. Because I donâ€™t want to sleep alone. Your needs change when you get olderâ€¦ At my age, a bigâ€¦ big pile of shitâ€™s as good as anybody.
[Laughter]
I actually have a girlfriend, but weâ€™re struggling, because she lives in France, uh, sheâ€™s French, she lives all the way over there, and we havenâ€™t been able to see each other for a year because of the disease. I have AIDS. And, uhâ€¦ [Laughter] Sheâ€™s great, though, she sends me presents all the time. Thatâ€™s how she keeps it going. She sends me gifts in the mail. I get something from her every week. Sometimes itâ€™s chocolate from France or a shirt she wishes I would wear instead of things like this. And sometimes she sends something to make fun of me because sheâ€™s a little fucked up, so last time she sent me a pair of little girlâ€™s panties. And, uhâ€¦ yeah, I was like, â€œThatâ€™s not funny,â€ because these are in my house now. I canâ€™t get rid of â€™em! Itâ€™s like nuclear waste! Think of it, I canâ€™t throw them out because I canâ€™t have people find little girlâ€™s panties in my garbage with coffee grounds and butter on â€™em.
[Laughter]
And every solution I think of makes it worse, like, if Iâ€¦ If I put â€™em in a bag inside another bag andâ€¦ Layers of duct tape, wrapped in tinfoil. Or if I put him in a coffee can and I nail it shut and I bury it in the park in the middle of the night. Or if I cut â€™em into tiny piecesâ€¦ and throw away one piece each week in a different town. My friend tried to help me, heâ€™s like, â€œWhy donâ€™t you just burn them?â€ Iâ€™m like, Do you understand? Even if thereâ€™s a one-in-a-million chance I get caught burning little girlâ€™s pantiesâ€¦ [Laughter] So Iâ€™m wearing them right now. Soâ€¦
[Laughter and applause]
Yepâ€¦ itâ€™s the only solution I could come up with, I wear â€™em every dayâ€¦ And I hand-wash them. And then I dry them like thisâ€¦ [Blowing] Just right on the little strawberries.
[Laughter]
Hereâ€™s the thing: menâ€¦ our biggest fear in life is that weâ€™re going to get caught being a kid f*cker, thatâ€™s every guyâ€™s biggest fear. Even if you would never do it, every guyâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s whatâ€™s going to happen to me, I know it.â€ Itâ€™s like being afraid of sharks when you live in the desert, like, â€œI donâ€™t go to the ocean, but itâ€™s going to happen.â€ â€˜Cause itâ€™s a fear not based in its likelihood, but in how horrible it would be if it happened. Because when they catch a pedophile, holy fuck. Holy shit! Itâ€™s brutalâ€¦ Because weâ€™re scared, weâ€™re so scared of pedophilia because itâ€™s here and itâ€™s not going anywhere. Thatâ€™s a factâ€¦ itâ€™s not like thereâ€™s a finite amount of pedophiles, and, â€œWe got the last one!â€ No, they keepâ€¦ It keeps happening; every generation, thereâ€™s more. Some of you have kids and some of them are going to grow up, and f*ck kids, they might, you know? Okay, no, Iâ€™mâ€¦ of courseâ€¦ Of course not yours, for some reason, butâ€¦ [Laughter] Theyâ€™re coming from some place. So any real solution has to start with the basic reality that there will always be pedophiles. Not a great thought, I understand, itâ€™s not an upliftingâ€¦ You wouldnâ€™t put that on a fridge magnet. [Laughter] Or on your screensaver at the office. â€œThere will always be pedophiles.â€ â€œHey, whereâ€™s Jim? Heâ€™s not at his desk.â€
We doâ€¦ we have to start with that reality, because our solutions that we have so far donâ€™t really work. Here is our current solution to pedophilia: We wait till somebody fucks about 10,000 kids, and then we go, â€œAll right, you, you better cut that out.â€ Thatâ€™s pretty much it. There is no measures for preventing it. None! We have no policy to prevent it peâ€¦ No, weâ€™re not even justâ€¦ Like a street sign. Thereâ€™s a street sign for everything! â€œNo hunting,â€ â€œno spitting,â€ â€œno skateboarding.â€ Iâ€™ve never seen a â€œDonâ€™t f*ck a childâ€ sign in the wâ€¦ Iâ€™ve been all over the world! Not even just like a picture of a guy f*cking a kid with a line through it, so that itâ€¦ transcends language barriers. I mean, try it! You wonâ€™t get most of them with the sign. But even if one out of 50 of them is like, â€œOh, shit, Iâ€™m sorry, I didnâ€™t know it was an issue,â€ thatâ€™s money well spent!
Thereâ€™s things that might work, and we donâ€™t even try them. Like, is anybody working on very realistic child sex dolls? Okay, then let â€™em f*ck your kids forever, is thâ€¦ if thatâ€™s better! Iâ€™m so sorryâ€¦ for suggesting something that might actually work. â€œOh, no! Let â€™em f*ck both my sons, but donâ€™t make a doll. That would be distasteful.â€ The thing is that thisâ€¦ Iâ€™m still talking about itâ€¦ Thisâ€¦ this problemâ€¦ We lose things because we wonâ€™t really face it, you know, that are important us, like the Boy Scouts. Boy Scoutsâ€¦ wonderful thing, being sued out of existence â€™cause of all the kid fuckery that goes on. And I know itâ€™s upsetting, because, look, hereâ€™s the thing: the Boy Scouts is a wonderful thing for kids. They go to the woods, they work together, they learn skills, they get in touch with nature. What could it be better for a boy than that? But some of those guys want to fuck the kids. I donâ€™t think they do it a lot. Itâ€™s not like thereâ€™s just a shit-load of kids being fucked in the Boy Scouts; I think itâ€™s mostly that they find out that the guy wants toâ€¦ I donâ€™t actually know, though. I donâ€™t. Do you know why I donâ€™t know? Because Iâ€™m afraid to look it up! Iâ€™ll go to prison for typing it into a Google! How do you solve a problem if youâ€™re afraid to fucking look it up? â€œHow many Boy Scouts get fucked on aâ€¦â€ [Imitating alarm blaring] â€œOh, shit!â€
[Laughter and applause]
Every time I move, Iâ€™ve got to tell my neighbors that I looked that up. Hereâ€™s what happensâ€¦ Every few years you find out thereâ€™s some pedophile-type people in the Boy Scouts and then they announce, â€œWe gotâ€¦ we got â€™em all, weâ€™re good.â€ And then a year later, â€œWhoa, thereâ€™s a bunch more!â€ [Harrumphs] â€œWhatâ€™s going on here?!â€
At some point, youâ€™ve got to wake up to the basic fact that theâ€¦ maybe the people who are best suited to give your kids these wonderful experiences are folks that want to f*ck them. Maybe thatâ€™sâ€¦ Maybe thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re good at it. Maybe thatâ€™sâ€¦ if you want that, thatâ€™s where you go. Maybe thatâ€™s just the way that goes. Who else would want to take a bunch of kids to the fucking woods?! Who wants to take your shit kid to the fucking woods?! You donâ€™t want to take â€™em! Who else would want to do that, except people that are barely containing that they want to f*ck every kid in the face? Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re good at it. Thatâ€™s what makes them good at it.
Iâ€™m not saying that all Scoutmasters are pedophiles. I might be saying that the best ones are. I might be saying that. That sounds right. So I donâ€™t knowâ€¦ you have to lose the whole thing? Just tell your kids, â€œSome of those guys want to f*ck you, just be careful, have a good time.â€
Take the contribution from where it comes. Michael Jacksonâ€¦ Wonderful music, blessed us with wonderful musicâ€¦ Did some other things, too. Whatâ€¦ look, whatâ€™s worse: a pedophile who makes beautiful music, or one that doesnâ€™t? This is the choices. â€œNo pedophilesâ€ is not on the menu.
So howâ€™ve you all been enjoying living the way I already was for a couple of years before all this shit?
[Laughter and applause]
Welcome to my life. Canâ€™t work, canâ€™t go outside, canâ€™t show your face, gotta wash your groceries. [Laughter] â€˜Cause I got cum on the groceries. Thatâ€™s why I justâ€¦ in my mind, thatâ€™s what it means. Maybe thatâ€™s not what youâ€™re thinking, butâ€¦
I have a solution for the pandemic, by the way, for COVID, I have it. This is it: We test everybody, first of all, and every time we find somebody who has COVID, you kill them. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s the solution. You wonâ€™t need another one after that one. Thatâ€™s the final one.
Itâ€™s been pretty amazing to be alive during this thing, during COVID, because youâ€™re not going to see this again, and, wow, did we learn some shit. Thatâ€™s reallyâ€¦ the things that teach you in life are things you never would have chosen to do for yourself. I mean, think about your life as far as itâ€™s been, where you had the choices, where youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m going to do this, Iâ€™m going to pursue this.â€ It all goes to shit, every bit of it. And even when it goes right, youâ€™re like, â€œWhy donâ€™t I like it? Itâ€™s what I wanted. But why donâ€™t I like it?!â€ Because itâ€™s your choice and your choices are based on fear and fucking just thin, stupid, shitty hopes. But when life just kicks you in the balls and youâ€™re like, â€œOh, fuck, everythingâ€™s different now,â€ and youâ€¦ It shows you shit you wouldnâ€™t have looked at otherwise. Thatâ€™s the great joy in it.
And what I thought was really interesting about COVID, and still is, is that itâ€™s the first thing Iâ€™ve seen where everyone on Earth had the same problem. Every human being on Earth had the same problem, and we never had that before. Thatâ€™s why we donâ€™t give a shit about each other, because you read, like, â€œOh, thereâ€™s floods in Houston,â€ youâ€™re like, â€œItâ€™s fucking water!â€ What is it? Whatâ€™s your problem? Floodsâ€¦ What does that? Just walk like this. Whatâ€™sâ€¦ what, you canâ€™t handle some water? My basement floodsâ€¦ What the fuck? Who gives a shit? Like, heâ€™s on a canoe in the streetâ€¦ â€œThat looks like fun. Why is that an issue?â€ Thereâ€™s fires in California. Whatâ€¦ [Blows] Blow it out. What, you canâ€™t fucking blow out a fire? Get the water from Houston and dump it on California. Fuckinâ€™ deal with it.
But we all had the same problem, every person from Zimbabwe to Tokyo to Newark to Honolulu, everybody was doing the same dumb shit. Every person had the same stupid fucking moment at the sameâ€¦ just trying to get the mask out of the well of your car door, trying toâ€¦ â€œI got to go in Walgreenâ€™s, whereâ€™s my fucking mask?â€ You try toâ€¦ Itâ€™s got pistachio shells in it and pennies. Shake itâ€¦ â€œIâ€™m sure itâ€™s still effective.â€
I actually like the masks, â€™cause it justâ€¦ Everybody looked nice. Everybody did, â€™cause itâ€™s just their eyes. Eyes are nice. You never hear somebody say, â€œThat guyâ€™s got gross eyes.â€ Itâ€™s reallyâ€¦ we should hide these, we should keep the masks, because this is disgusting, how do we justâ€¦ With no shame, â€œLook inside my face! Ha-ha-ha!â€ Spit and tongue and teeth? Itâ€™s fucking gross! Cover your mouth! Donâ€™tâ€¦
Iâ€™d rather look at your asshole than your mouth. I really would, Iâ€™d rather stare into your asshole than glance at your mouth. Assholes arenâ€™t that bad, not to look at. We donâ€™t like to think about assholes, â€™cause, like, you know, the shit and the farts and the diarrhea. But thatâ€™s a small portion of their time. You ever really look at an assâ€¦ You ever really look? [Laughter] [Blowing] Mmm. Once you see it, like in nature, itâ€™s justâ€¦ itâ€™s a littleâ€¦ [Squeaks] Thatâ€™s all. Thatâ€™s your asshole. Itâ€™s likeâ€¦ You know what it is? Itâ€™s just an aperture, thatâ€™s all it is. Thatâ€™s your asshole. Itâ€™s like a camera shutter, thatâ€™s all it is. Itâ€™s like the opening to the James Bond movies, Thatâ€™s what your assholeâ€™sâ€¦ [Imitating James Bond theme] [Laughter] [Imitates gunshot, flatulence]
You ever go to lick somebodyâ€™s asshole and thereâ€™s a little guy with a gun in there? [Laughter] It was bad.
But it really was an interesting social experiment, COVID, because everybody got told the same thingâ€¦ The whole world got told the same thing. If you go out unnecessarily, millions will die. And a lot of us said, â€œOh, Iâ€™m going out.â€ [Laughter] â€œYeahâ€¦ Iâ€™m going now and a lot.â€ Yeah, and millions died. Just, weâ€™re not that different from the turtles that youâ€™re trying to get them not to cross the fucking highway and theyâ€™re like this, â€œWhere I fuck, I fucked over there, fuck you.â€ And weâ€™re like, â€œPlease stop!â€ Putting little signs upâ€¦ â€œDonâ€™t go!â€ And heâ€™s, â€œFuck you. Iâ€™m a turtleâ€¦â€ [Imitates splatting] It doesnâ€™tâ€¦ Weâ€™re not that different. Weâ€™re just a fuckinâ€™ species, and weâ€™re just rolling along. Yeah, many dying old ladies died. Thatâ€™s what happened. Many dying old ladies finished dying.
[Laughter]
Hereâ€™s the way you got to look at it, okay? Weâ€™re still making more. Weâ€™re making new old ladies. Every day. Thereâ€™s a fresh batch coming, theyâ€™re going to be great.
I was having sex with a woman once, and she was so beautiful, I was having trouble not cumming, so I pictured her face at 80 years old, and then I came immediately. [Laughter] Because she was 92.
[Laughter]
Anywayâ€¦ One thing I found very interesting was that during the pandemic, a lot of people really liked counting the dead people. That got very popular, was counting the amount of the dead and dying. â€œDo you know how many peopleâ€¦ Just today! Just today! Do you know how many people died of COVID-19?!â€ â€œJust today!â€
Whenâ€¦ whyâ€¦ whâ€¦ Keeping a daily tally? We donâ€™t do thisâ€¦ A lot of shit going on that we donâ€™t keep a daily tally of how manyâ€¦ babies were dropped in a bucket of paint. And I looked that up! Iâ€™m not kidding you. Itâ€™s 30 a day, itâ€™s a real problem. Iâ€™m serious! A steady 30 babies a day are dropped in buckets of paint. Itâ€™s not random, itâ€™s one guy that wonâ€™t stop doing it.
[Laughter]
Yeah, we liked counting them, we liked counting the dead. And when it got really high, we didnâ€™t know how to count them anymore, people trying to find different ways to express the number or take it in. Remember January? It was really bâ€¦ It was 3,000 people every day were dying of COVID, so people started saying thisâ€¦ â€œThis is 9-11 every day.â€ â€œThis is literally 9-11 every day.â€ When did we start measuring deaths in â€œ9-11sâ€? When did that become the new, â€œhow many football fields long is it,â€ for mass death? â€œHow many 9-11s was World War II? Can we look it up?â€ I know the Holocaust was 2,000 9-11s. 9-11 wasnâ€™t that bad, it was just one.
[Laughter and applause]
Only one 9-11 of people died on 9-11. Thatâ€™s like nobody died that day.
See, itâ€™s all relative, because then you have thoseâ€¦ Laterâ€¦ remember, January was really bad, January was the worst, and then in April, March/April, we all felt better, everybodyâ€™s like, â€œOh, itâ€™s way better now, itâ€™s way better, â€œway better than Januaryâ€â€¦ I looked it up, it was 1,500 people a dayâ€¦ and everybodyâ€™s like, â€œItâ€™s way better than January.â€ Really?! Itâ€™s half a 9-11 every single day. But thatâ€™s way better. That would be like if on 9-11, after the first tower went down, youâ€™re like, â€œEh, thatâ€™s not that badâ€¦â€ Itâ€™s just one. â€œStill got the other one, thatâ€™s why they made two.â€ Itâ€™s okay, itâ€™s all right toâ€¦ make fun of 9-11, it was a hoax. Uhâ€¦
[Laughter]
All right. Sorry. Anywayâ€¦
[Laughter and applause]
[Cheering and applause]
I thought I had COVID about three times, Iâ€™m one of those idiots, I was like, â€œI think I have it. Can you feel?â€
Iâ€™m bad with pain too, like, the other day I hit my elbow right on that spot where if I had a gun, Iâ€™d be dead now, you know, that sâ€¦ I canâ€™t do pain. Thatâ€™s why I could never be a cop. I couldnâ€™t walk around with a gun right here. Thereâ€™s 50 things a day where Iâ€™d be like, â€œFuck that, that ainâ€™t worthâ€¦â€ Thatâ€™s my main problem, by the way, with the whole â€œdefund the policeâ€ idea: What about people who want to commit suicide by cop? What about them? Anyway, weâ€™ll put a pin in that, butâ€¦
We had a lot of protests in New York, and now we have protesters that just live here. Theyâ€™re not at a protest, theyâ€™re just here. I saw a protester in Washington Square Park. She had green hair and dirty legs. And sheâ€™s holding a little piece of cardboard, and itâ€™sâ€¦ with a Sharpieâ€¦ It said â€œAbolish billionaires.â€ Sheâ€™s standing there. And I thought, â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s going to do it. I donâ€™tâ€¦â€ It doesnâ€™t feel like thatâ€™s going to resultâ€¦ â€œin Jeff Bezos going, â€˜Whatâ€™s happening to me?'â€ [Laughter] Sadly, itâ€™s going to be okay for him.
I think thatâ€¦ I thought it was good how pâ€¦ How young people got out there and they expressed themselves, they went out there to solve a lot of problems. Not all the problems, but some of them. They went out there to stop discrimination. Uh, not all discrimination. Just some of it, which is a weird form of discrimination. But there are groupsâ€¦ There are groups that are discriminated against, theâ€¦ who donâ€™t have any protesters or any people working for them. And we all discriminate against these people, like ugly people. Everybody discriminates against ugly people. They do, and itâ€™s awfulâ€¦ I mean, Iâ€™d rather be discriminated against for my race than for being ugly because you might not lose a job or a promotion, but nobody kisses you on the lips, like, your whole fucking life, like, try that. This is what we say to ugly peopleâ€¦ â€œWe donâ€™t like your face. Just donâ€™t like it. So no oneâ€™s going to fall in love with you, and itâ€™s unanimousâ€¦ sorry.â€ And we just expect ugly people to be like, â€œOh, no, I understand. I mean, sure, my head shape is no good for you, so Iâ€™llâ€¦ Iâ€™ll withâ€¦ Iâ€™ll go without the things that matter in life.â€
[Laughter]
Also, overweight peopleâ€¦ Overweight people deal with things that none of us deal withâ€¦ Because Iâ€™m not overweight. Thereâ€™s peopleâ€¦ [Laughter] Who are discriminated against because of their weight. I read a story once about a woman who was 600 pounds and she couldnâ€™t get medical care, because everythingâ€¦ She goes to the doctor, he just says itâ€™s because sheâ€™s fatâ€¦ everything. Sheâ€™s like, â€œMy knees hurt,â€ heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, my knees hurt just looking at you, whatâ€™d you think was going to happen?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI have chest pains,â€ he says, â€œYeah, â€™cause your organs are over capacity, so they are hurting.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI got shot in the head,â€ heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, because youâ€™re fucking fat, somebody shot you in the fucking head â€™cause youâ€™re fat.â€
Itâ€™s a terrible story. Hereâ€™s the worst part of the story, and this is true, this is true: she needed an MRI because she had something serious; sheâ€™s 600 pounds, she doesnâ€™t fit in the machine. Do you know what they did? They sent her to the zoo. Iâ€™m not kidding, they sent her to the fuckinâ€™ zoo! Thatâ€™s what we do for fat peopleâ€¦ who need an MRI! â€œHey, hereâ€™s your prescriptionâ€¦ go to the zoo.â€ Yeah, thatâ€™s where you should go. â€œYou should go to the zoo.â€
By the way, you know how many fat people we have in this country? About 600 trillion-billion- thousands of â€™em! You know how many trans people there are? About 38. But if youâ€™re trans and you need a restroom and itâ€™s awkward, weâ€™ll change every restroom! But if youâ€™re fat and you need an MRI, you go to the zoo, you fat b*tch. Just go to the zoo. You go experience that today.
What happens when she gets to the zoo? What actually fucking happens when she arrives at the zoo?! â€œHiâ€¦ Are you here to see the monkeys?â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™m here for an MRI.â€ â€œOh, shit. All right. Yeah.â€ Uh-Huh. Okay, just stand in the straw over here. â€œYeah, youâ€™re after the walrus who has lymphoma.â€
[Laughter]
By the way, why is there an MRI machine at the fuckinâ€™ zoo?! Who was it developing that instead of a fat-human-being MRI? Whoâ€™s paying for this shit? You donâ€™t give an elephant a fucking magnetic resonance image test! Are you fuckinâ€™ high? Thatâ€™s obscene! If an elephant is sick, you just listen. You do this thing. â€œMe-sa thinks she gonna die today.â€
Iâ€™m saying this out of respect for elephants, by the way, because weâ€™re supposed to respect how they live. They donâ€™t fucking cure their diseases. This is not their culture, this is our weirdâ€¦ â€œLetâ€™s fix it! Oh, heâ€™s sick!â€ Thatâ€™s not how elephants live! An elephant in the Serengeti isnâ€™t like, â€œI have a lump, I have to see my oncologist.â€ When an elephant gets cancer, he falls over and takes his fuckinâ€™ turn and becomes food. You donâ€™t put an elephant in a state-of-the-artâ€¦ [Imitates beeping] What if you find cancer? What, are you going to give them chemotherapy? Think a skinny elephant with a pink baseball hat.
[Laughter and applause]
[Labored breathing] â€œEach day is a gift.â€
[Laughter]
I love animals, I doâ€¦ I do. We have a weird relationship to animalsâ€¦ We name them and we play with them, and we kill them and we eat them, and we stuff them. And we draw them. I have a dogâ€¦ I love my dog, but I donâ€™t know my dog. Weâ€™ve never had a conversation, not one time. I talk and she just hearsâ€¦ [Gibberish] [Gibberish] She looks at me, Iâ€™m like, â€œYes!â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhat, you donâ€™t know what the fuck Iâ€™m thinkâ€¦â€ â€œFuck youâ€â€¦
I donâ€™t know this bitch, I have no idea what sheâ€™s thinking. I really wish I did, I wish I knew what she was thinking, itâ€™s my biggest wish, maybe, in life, is that I knew, â€™cause I know she has thoughts. I know she does. Thereâ€™s no way sheâ€™s just like, â€œDog.â€ Thereâ€™s stuff going on in here. Iâ€™ve seen it. You ever watch your dog make a decision? You ever dâ€¦ watch your dog just walk in the room and then look around, likeâ€¦ â€œIâ€™m going to go over here.â€ Why?! Please tell me why!
I think my dog thinks Iâ€™m insane because I look at my life through herâ€¦ through her eyes, like, Iâ€™ll watch TV for four hours, and from my dogâ€™s point of view, Iâ€™m just sitting there.
[Sustained laughter, scattered applause]
[Exaggerated laughing]
â€œWhatâ€¦ the fuck is he laughing, what happened?â€
My dog is my life now because my kids are grown up, my kids are in college and theyâ€™re all, you knowâ€¦ Iâ€™m an empty nester. Thatâ€™s what you call it when your kids are goneâ€¦ â€™cause they grow up, not if theyâ€™re dead. Itâ€™s not used that way. â€œMy daughter died of leukemia.â€ â€œHey, youâ€™re an empty nester!â€
[Laughter]
I miss it, I miss having little kids. I think about it all the time, I think about itâ€¦ Maybe adopting, you know, I could adopt a baby from a Third World country. Thatâ€™s a good thing to do because you can just leave â€™em outside, you donâ€™t have toâ€¦
[Laughter]
You know, itâ€™s interestingâ€¦ Weâ€™ve been adopting babies from other countries in America for a long time. You know, other countries do it too, but I live here, so Iâ€™ll talk about that, butâ€¦ Itâ€™s an interesting thing. Itâ€™s not a biological imperative to go get a baby from thousands of miles away, but weâ€™ve been doing that in large numbers here for a long time, and not always for the same reasons. Thereâ€™s been different reasons why weâ€™ve done it. In the early, like, in the â€™70s, when I grew up, sometimes youâ€™d meet a couple who had an African baby that they brought because there are those kind of, you know, these kinds of people, you know, the kind of couples that hold hands when they announce things. You know those kind of people? They gather their friends and theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™ve decidedâ€â€¦ You know thoseâ€¦? They have a farm table with a clay pot of honey on it. And their apple juice is cloudy. You know what Iâ€™m talking about? Those are the kind of people that make a trip to Zimbabwe and get a baby and name him Kevin and send him to Boston College, whatever.
That was like the â€™70s and â€™80s; then in the â€™90s, it became very popular with gay couples, started to adopt babies from China because they want to have a baby, but they canâ€™tâ€¦ They both have dicks. I donâ€™t know if you know that. Did you know that? Gay couples have two dicks, so they canâ€™t make a baby. You can try. You canâ€¦ This is really fuckinâ€™â€¦ You couldâ€¦ [Laughs] You could try to cum into one dick with the other, like, if you line up to dick holes and you could cum, and the sperm goes up this dick and down that one. And then this sperm gets to the balls and heâ€¦ and theyâ€™re like, â€œWhat the fuck? Whereâ€¦?â€ â€œDid we turn around? â€˜Cause weâ€™re in the balls again.â€ Whose balls are these?! These arenâ€™t even his balls! Oh, heâ€™s gay. Fuck. All right. Okay, all right. â€œWell, just swim around until weâ€™re dead.â€ Itâ€™s just the way it is, youâ€™re not going toâ€¦ A baby will never come out of a penis. Which is good. Itâ€™s a good thing. Because itâ€™s hard for women. Imagine pushing a whole baby out of your penis, dickhole. Even just the hand. Yeah. Anyway, so thatâ€™s why gay couples adopt. Thatâ€™s why.
[Cheering and applause]
And often from China, because they make a lot of stuff there. Uhâ€¦
[Laughter]
So that was that, that wasâ€¦ The gay couples were adopting Chinese babies because they couldnâ€™t have babies, and thenâ€¦ and then a lot of other couples started doing it more around the turn of the century. I used to live in Hollywood, which is a pretty awful place, and everybody there gets Chinese babies. Itâ€™s very popular. They goâ€¦ becauseâ€¦ And itâ€™s not because they canâ€™t have babies, and itâ€™s not because theyâ€™re trying to help somebody from far away; itâ€™s because theyâ€™re just busy; theyâ€™re busyâ€¦ They want to have a baby, but they donâ€™t want to have a baby. You know what I mean? That thing where you canâ€™t have your baby and eat it too, or whatâ€¦ I donâ€™t know howâ€¦ They want to get pregnant is the point, so they go to Chinaâ€¦ They donâ€™t even go to China, they go to the airport and somebody from China meets them, gives them a babyâ€¦ itâ€™s true. They just take it home and then they get a Jamaican nanny to watch their Chinese baby, and they go to cocktail parties. â€œWe have this Chinese baby, itâ€™s amazing.â€ And meanwhile, the Chinese baby and the Jamaican nanny are just alone, looking at each other like, â€œWhat are we doing? What isâ€¦? What is this?â€ Why canâ€™t either of us see our families? Whyâ€¦? â€œWhat the fuck is the point of this?â€
So, yeah, my dog, I got a dog, my kids are, eh, and I just sit around and watch, uh, watch YouTube a lotâ€¦ Thatâ€™s my favoriteâ€¦ pastime. Umâ€¦ I was watching YouTube today; I was watching one of the ads that comes on before the video I waâ€¦ I donâ€™t skip those. I think thatâ€™s rude. It is. Itâ€™s mean. Somebody worked hard on that ad. They trained a cheetah to run alongside a Jeep Cherokee. And youâ€™re at home like, â€œThree, two, oneâ€¦ fuck off.â€ [Laughter] Fucking meanâ€¦ what if you made something, dick?
Anyway, the ad was a PSA. It was a, uh, anti-smoking message. It was a Puerto Rican man with a hole in his throat, he was likeâ€¦ [Imitating electrolarynx]
â€œMy father smoked. And my mother smoked. I wish I never smoked in my life. Please donâ€™t smoke cigarettes. Cigarettes are very, very bad for you.â€
First thought I had was, why does he still have an accent?
[Laughter]
Itâ€™s coming outâ€¦ Feels like if you bypass the mouthâ€¦ You shouldnâ€™t have an accident anymore. Does the machine have a setting for â€œPuerto Ricanâ€? Is that just how air sounds coming out of this guy? Does he fart with an accent? [Imitates flatulence] â€œSenor, Iâ€™m farting!â€
Anyway, after the ad, I watched the video that I was looking for, which was a scene from a movie, and itâ€™s a scene that I really hateâ€¦ Every time I see it, it makes me angry, which is why I was looking for it on YouTube. And itâ€™s a movie I likeâ€¦ I actually like the movie. Itâ€™s called Good Will Hunting, remember Good Will Hunting?
[Cheering and applause]
Of course, right? Matt Damon playedâ€¦ A great performance. He plays a very complicated young man w-wearing a tight T-shirt for a whole movie. And hereâ€™s the thingâ€¦ Hereâ€™s my issue with Good Will Huntingâ€¦ Matt Damon also wrote the movie. Okay? So he basically sat down, heâ€™s like, â€œFirst of all, I am amazing.â€ [Laughter] â€œIâ€™m a construction worker, Iâ€™m, like, working-class, and I drink beer and I get in fights, I get into so many fights. My friends are like, â€˜Youâ€™re out of control, man, â€˜ and Iâ€™m like, â€˜Shut up this is the way I am.â€™ But then also, Iâ€™m a genius. Ooh! Iâ€™m notâ€¦ I didnâ€™t even go to school, I just know things, I donâ€™t know whyâ€¦ I just know them. And all the nerdy geniuses that studied for years are like, â€œâ€˜Heâ€™s so much smarter than us, itâ€™s making it upsetâ€™.â€
Itâ€™s insane! Itâ€™s fucking insane. It only makes sense if he wrote it for himself to be the guy. So the scene I was looking for, itâ€™s the worst example of that in the movie. Hereâ€™s what happens. He goes to a bar and he meets a woman and he likes her. And another guy likes her too. But she picks Matt Damonâ€¦ because he wrote the fucking movie! Because he decided, you understand?! â€œShe doesnâ€™t like him, she likes me, you better believe it!â€ [Laughter] So he gets her phone number and then he goes outside and he sees the other guy in the window of a restaurant, and he decides to taunt him, so he goes overâ€¦ He tells his friends, â€œHey, come here, watch this.â€ And he says to the guy, â€œHey, do you like apples?â€ [Laughter] And the guy says, â€œYes.â€ And Matt Damon goes, â€œWell, I got her number. How do you like them apples?â€ And all Matt Damonâ€™s friends go, â€œOh-ho!â€ Ho-ho! This was amazing! Oh! Oh-ho, my God! Oh, my God! You were ready with that! â€œHow?!â€ You know how he did it? He wrote the whole fucking movie, okay?! He made everybody say all the things. Otherwise, this doesnâ€™t happen. I mean, he hinges the whole fucking prank on the guy likinâ€™ apples; the guy must like apples. Who the fuckâ€¦ Who would say â€œyesâ€â€¦ to, â€œDo you like apples?â€â€¦ Coming from a clear antagonistâ€¦ whoâ€™s setting him upâ€¦ Gathered his friends. â€œDo youâ€¦ Ha, wait, guys watch thisâ€¦ Do you like apples?â€ [Sighs] God damn it, I do. I wish I didnâ€™t. â€˜Cause I can tell this is not going to go my way. But I justâ€¦ I canâ€™t lie. Theyâ€™ll know it. Theyâ€™ll know itâ€™s because, boy, do I like apples.
Do you understand if he says â€œno,â€ Matt Damon is fucked. Heâ€™s fucked in the face for life. Heâ€™s got nothinâ€™! â€œDo you like apples?â€ â€œNo.â€ â€œDâ€¦â€ [Stammers] [Laughter] â€œWhatâ€¦â€ Dude. Fuckinâ€™ guy. No, come on, seriously. Seriously, you fuckinâ€™â€¦ Donâ€™t fuckinâ€™â€¦ Donâ€™t fuckinâ€™â€¦ [Labored breathing] Doâ€¦ doâ€¦ doâ€¦ Do you like bananas? Doâ€¦ â€™cause I thoughtâ€¦ â€™cause the woman gave me her telephone number, and isnâ€™t that bananas? [Laughter]
I saw a guyâ€¦ I saw a guy peeling a banana the other day. Itâ€™s another banana joked, becauseâ€¦ Did you hear the other one ended with â€œbananaâ€? Bananaâ€¦ I got three banana jokes, by the way. This is number two. Okay. I saw a guy peeling a banana on Sixth Avenue, and it bothered me. Iâ€™ll tell you why, because itâ€™s the way heâ€¦ When I peel a banana, I hold around here, I peel down to my hand, right? This guy holds the banana at the bottom. And he just peels the whole thing all the way down. It felt like a guy at a urinal pulling his pants all the way to his ankles. I was like, â€œDude, TMI with that banana right now. What are you making a smoothie on Sixth Avenue? What are you doing?â€ The banana was like, â€œHey!â€ You donâ€™t even know how much youâ€™re going to eat. â€œI have a bruise right here.â€
Kind of got lost in the banana shame there. You wanna hear the other banana one now?
[Cheering and applause]
All right. Okay, soâ€¦ I was at the grocery storeâ€¦ and I needed bananas. So I go over to where the bananas are, and thereâ€™s a Black woman at the bananas. Itâ€™s going to be okay. Itâ€™s going to be okay, I swear.
[Applause]
I understand. White people are very scared of discussing bananas and Black people in the same conversation. I understandâ€¦ if I have a Black friend over, I would never offer him a banana. I just, I donâ€™t know why, I just wouldnâ€™t do it. â€œHey, you want a banana?â€ â€œWhy the fuck you asking me?â€ â€œHey, man, sorry, you have an apple? Iâ€™m really sorry.â€
These are just the facts of the case. All right? I was in a store, looking for bananas and thereâ€™s a Black woman in the bananas, and I wanted toâ€¦ I didnâ€™t want to go there while sheâ€™s there because of COVID. Weâ€™re all giving each other space. So Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ But I do want to be next. So Iâ€™m waiting. And sheâ€™s kind of takinâ€™ a long time. And the longer she takes, the longer Iâ€™m a white man watching a Black woman choose bananas. And this is an awful thing about the world today, because I know Iâ€™m not doing anything wrong, but I feel fucking bad. I feel fucking bad. So I went to the strawberries. [Chuckles] And thereâ€™s a f*ckinâ€™ Jew at the strawberries.
[Laughter and applause]
â€œHereâ€™s a nice one!â€ [Laughs, clears throat] Thatâ€™s the Jew. Iâ€™m not going to do the Black woman. No, notâ€¦ you know why? Because Iâ€™m not afraid of Jews. Thatâ€™s reallyâ€¦ Thatâ€™s the bottom line. Iâ€™m not scared of Jews. I donâ€™t find Jews to be frighteningâ€¦ unless youâ€™re in Palestine, then theyâ€™re terrifying. Itâ€™s very different. Over there, theyâ€™re like, â€œThe Jews are killing us!â€ And here, weâ€™re like, â€œReally? The Jews?â€
[Laughter]
â€œWeâ€™ve been slapping them around for years.â€ Anyway.
â€œThis bananaâ€™s too hard!â€
[Laughter and applause]
â€œWell, this bananaâ€™s soft, but Iâ€™m not gonâ€™ have it till Tuesday, soâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna buy the hard one and wait.â€
Just trying to be fair. Just trying to be fair to the Jews.
â€œLawd, have mercy.â€ Anywayâ€¦
[Cheering and applause]
Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m an old man, Iâ€™ll be gone very soon. I worry about getting old only â€™cause I donâ€™t want to lose my memory, you know? I mean, some of it I would love to lose. [Laughter] But it doesnâ€™t work that way. You got to take it all or none, I guess. But I loseâ€¦ I forget things, you know, like, remember Fonzie from Happy Days? I donâ€™t remember him. I donâ€™t even know what youâ€™re talking about.
I forget weird things, you know? Like I was walking down the street once in New York and there was a guy in a van and he roll down the window and he said, â€œHey, get in the van and suck my d*ck.â€ And I said, â€œAll right,â€ you know, soâ€¦ I got in the van and, you know, I was trying to pull the door, the sliding door, but it keptâ€¦ and heâ€™s like, â€œIt just shuts, donâ€™tâ€¦ You donâ€™t have toâ€¦ I was like, â€œSorry.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œEverybody does that, itâ€™s okay.â€ So Iâ€™m kneeling on the floor of the van on like a purse, and thereâ€™s no lady in there, but Iâ€™m like, â€œI came here to suck this guyâ€™s d*ck, not, like, take inventory. I should just get to work,â€ so I started suckinâ€™ his d*ck, and about halfway throughâ€¦ Iâ€™m guessingâ€¦ I rememberedâ€¦ that, I donâ€™t really like doing that.
[Laughter]
So, senior moment.
[Laughter]
Some people worry about getting old because they think it means that theyâ€™re dying, which it does. But this doesnâ€™t worry meâ€¦ I donâ€™t worry about dying because I think itâ€™s necessary. I think itâ€™s something that you just have to do. You should do it. Itâ€™sâ€¦ when itâ€™s your turn, you should do it. If somebody you know, your doctor says youâ€™re dying, just say, â€œOkay,â€ and dieâ€¦ Donâ€™t, you know, â€œMay be a miracle?â€ Fuck you, get in the ground, just take your turn. I really think that way nowâ€¦ I didnâ€™t used to, but I do, because Iâ€¦
You know when I started thinking that way was when my mom died. My mom died a couple of years ago of anorexia. She was 300 pounds. She was bad at it. [Laughter] I know itâ€™s fucked up, right? [Laughter] Hmm. What a piece of shit. Anywayâ€¦ She would have liked that joke. She would have! My mom, fuckinâ€™, she was gross. And I remember when she was dying, I wasâ€¦ I was alone with her, and the nurse said, â€œThis isâ€¦ this is imminent.â€ I was like, â€œWhat does that mean?â€ She goes, â€œItâ€™sâ€¦ sheâ€™s going to die in a minute.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œJust say, â€˜in a minuteâ€™. Itâ€™s so close.â€ Anyway, I was alone with her and she died, and I was like, â€œFuck, theyâ€™re going to think I did it, obviously.â€
I didnâ€™t want to lose my mom, I really didnâ€™t, but Iâ€¦ but we had this one conversation, like, two weeks before she died, when we wereâ€¦ We were talking about it and I said, â€œMom, I donâ€™t want you to die.â€ And she said, â€œYouâ€™ll get over it.â€ Thatâ€™s what she said! And I did. But in the moment, I wasnâ€™t willing to accept it, I was like, â€œI donâ€™t want you to go,â€ she said, â€œBut weâ€™re going in order.â€ Do you understand? This makes sense. Iâ€™m your mother,â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œMom, stop talking like that. This is sad,â€ she goes, â€œNo, itâ€™s not. Look at it this way, wouldâ€¦ Do you want me to never die?â€ I was like, â€œNo, I donâ€™t want that at all.â€
And it helped me get in touch with an important idea, which is that dying is important, itâ€™s every generationâ€™s greatest contribution to history is that they die. Itâ€™s the only thing that keeps things moving; itâ€™s the only reason thereâ€™s any progress in the human race is that folks keep fucking dying. Every generation has had a mix of douche bags and amazing people and boring, great, good, whatever, but theyâ€™re all fucking dead. Every fuckinâ€™ one. Thank God, theyâ€™re all fucking dead. Thereâ€™s a limit to how much any of the good ones did, and the shitty ones got to stop being shitty. Itâ€™s a great system. Now, when you look at the Internet and all these people, youâ€™re like, â€œWhat the fuck is happening?â€ Theyâ€™â€¦ itâ€™s okay. Theyâ€™re all going! Every thâ€¦ All of them are going to die. I mean, you donâ€™t want to die.
[Cheers and applause]
You donâ€™t want to die, you donâ€™t want your loved ones to die, but thatâ€™s a selfish wish when you think about what would happen if nobody diedâ€¦ What kind of world would this be if there was noâ€¦ Nobody dâ€¦ If we still had people here from the 1100s? Itâ€™s hard enough having people here from the â€™50s! â€œSir, just scan the code on the table, thereâ€™s no menu.â€ â€œWhat?! I donâ€™t understand!â€ Jesus Christ! You want to go through that with Pontius Pilate and Charlemagne?
[Laughter]
Fucking pain in the ass. Fucking old people that donâ€™t want to fucking, just, when you get older and you start going, â€œEverythingâ€™s so crazy nowâ€â€¦ No, itâ€™s fine, just get the fuck out. Itâ€™s great. Theyâ€™re not going to make it work for you, youâ€™re here for 10 more minutes, just get the fuck out.
If youâ€™re in an airport and youâ€™re looking at the toilet and youâ€™re like, â€œI donâ€™t understand how this works,â€ itâ€™s time for you to die, thatâ€™s what that means. These toilets are for the next people, get the fuck out.
Thatâ€™s the way I look at my life now. I had some good, I had some bad, but Iâ€™m done. I mean, Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™ll hang around â€™cause Iâ€™m curious. But Iâ€™m so interested in the way things are going, I really am, itâ€™s such an interesting time, such aâ€¦ weâ€™re on a hinge, itâ€™s such a cool thing to experience that. Iâ€™m excited about a lot of whatâ€™s coming, thereâ€™s things that are hard now, but thatâ€™s the way it is. Things are going to getâ€¦
I think itâ€™s exciting whatâ€™s happening; I think young people today have some great ideas. Theyâ€™re being a little cunty about some of them, but the ideas are good. The ideas are good. Like, when I was growing up, we had two gendersâ€¦ Male and female. Now you have all these expansion teams. I think itâ€™s very exciting. It is! And the best idea is this gender fluid thing. This is a great fucking idea. Gender fluid, the idea, the way I barely understand it, is that youâ€¦ you justâ€¦ Something in the middle. Itâ€™s like a fretless bass. You donâ€™t have to beâ€¦ The specific picturesâ€¦ What a dumb way to do it. â€œThese are the kinds of people you can be, which one are you?â€ â€œI donâ€™t feel like any of those people.â€ â€œThen youâ€™re a failure. You have to fiâ€¦ Start acting like these people so we know what to call you.â€ Why?! Just make it aâ€¦ Itâ€™s just aâ€¦ pbbt, What, justâ€¦ A la carte, â€œI like d*cks, I donâ€™t like balls, Iâ€™m aâ€¦ this andâ€¦ moving through it, changing when it feels like it.â€
I wishâ€¦ what Iâ€™m saying is I wish we had that when I was a kid, because I think our generation got hurt by the rigidity of identities and how you had to just stick to them. You didnâ€™t pick one right away. Youâ€™re eight years old, â€œWhat are you?â€ â€œIâ€™m aâ€¦ Iâ€™m a boy.â€ â€œWhat do you like?â€ â€œUh, girlsâ€¦ Vaginas! Love vaginas!â€ Iâ€™m eight years old, I never saw one, but Iâ€™m committing my life to them right now. I donâ€™t even get to smell one for a second! Just a sniff! [Sniffs] â€œAll right, what else you got?â€
[Laughter and applause]
Ten years old, â€œAre you gay?â€ â€œNo, no, no, I hate d*cks, hate â€™em.â€ What do I know? I didnâ€™t even get to fidget with one for a minute!
[Laughter]
â€œThis bananaâ€™s too hard!â€
[Laughter and applause]
Iâ€™m not saying I wish I could have blown all my friends to see what itâ€™s like. But on 4th of July, there were fireworks, I was with Matt, there was a feelingâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what could have happened. I have no ideaâ€¦ Because we were so scared. We were soâ€¦ We were afraid to seem gay when I was a kid, â€™cause in the â€™70s, the stereotypes showed you what everybody is like. [Deep voice] Men are like this. [Falsetto] And then the women have to act like this, and then gay people are likeâ€¦ theyâ€™re just tired. That was gay people in the â€™70s. â€œIâ€™m gay. Help, Iâ€™m gay, I canâ€™t even do anything.â€ Thatâ€™s what gay men were in the â€™70s.
You ever meet a gay person? You donâ€™t fuck with gay people, not today. Theyâ€™re all athletes, first of all. And theyâ€¦ they got their shit together. Theyâ€™re fuckingâ€¦ their motherfuckers, gay people. Your landlordâ€™s gay. Theyâ€™re billionaires! They own Apple. Theyâ€™re in the cabinet, theyâ€™re in the Navy. Theyâ€™reâ€¦ theyâ€™reâ€¦ theyâ€™re cowboys and Indians and construction workers. Gay men are men. You ever go in a gay-owned business? Heâ€™s like, â€œCan I help you?â€ Like, the gayâ€™s in there, but heâ€™s fucking tough now. â€œThis is my store, motherfucker, what do you want?â€ Gay men are men now. Theyâ€™reâ€¦ theyâ€™re fathers, theyâ€™re husbands, theyâ€™re men. Todayâ€™s heterosexual men are f*ggots. I donâ€™t know how that happened!
[Cheering and applause]
And Iâ€¦ but theyâ€™re f*gs!
[Cheering and applause]
Iâ€™m saying that with love and as an old man on his way out the door, but theyâ€™re fucking f*gs! Theyâ€™re intelligent and theyâ€™re evolved, but theyâ€™re f*gs, with the pajama shorts?! And theâ€¦ just pale, almost blue. â€œMm, my wife got a promotion today.â€ Oh, good for you, f*ggot. Iâ€™m so happy. I am! Iâ€™m happy for him! Sounds like a goodâ€¦ They have a good life together. But it takes some getting used to for meâ€¦ When I see a progressive young couple, I always want to stop them and ask her, â€œIs that turning you on? Please tell me, is that sexy?â€ Heâ€¦ with the Tin Manâ€™s hand pipe, justâ€¦ Strawberry smoke. â€œPbbt!â€ Sheâ€™s like, Well, heâ€™s very intelligent â€œand heâ€™s conscientiousâ€â€¦ But does he make your p*ssy wet? â€œFuck, no, heâ€™s a f*g. But I love him.â€
And again, great, itâ€™s another kind of dude, â€œf*ggy straight dude,â€ itâ€™s another kind of guy. Welcome! We should have all of it, the whole spectrum, the whole alphabet, all of it. But somebody does have to be just a straight fucking. You have to have that. It doesnâ€™t have to be the most important, but you do need it because itâ€™s where it all fuckinâ€™ comes from. Until they figure out some other shit, this is where life still starts. Ifâ€¦ if you want to eat local and organic, you got to respect that someoneâ€™s got to have a hard d*ck f*cking a p*ssy. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ thatâ€™s where every trans, every gay person, came fromâ€¦ two boring straight people f*cking. I mean, thatâ€™s justâ€¦ for now, itâ€™sâ€¦ someone needsâ€¦ You couldâ€¦ With an original d*ck, not a turned-inside-out p*ssy wrapped in thigh fleshâ€¦ Which is wonderful! Wonderful! You got to respect that! You do! Somebody who wants to be themselves so bad they rip their balls offâ€¦ That takes balls to do that. It does! Fuckinâ€™ respect! But someoneâ€™s got to have a factory d*ck with matching numbers, fucking a wet, farm-raised p*ssy.
[Laughter and applause]
Thank you very much. Good night, everybody. Thank you.
â™ª Ah, you never turned around to see the frowns â™ª â™ª On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did â™ª â™ª Tricks for you â™ª

â™ª You never understood that it ainâ€™t no good â™ª â™ª You shouldnâ€™t let other people get your â™ª â™ª Kicks for you â™ª

â€œThis is the latest Iâ€™ve stayed up in a long time.â€
â€œYeah, me too.â€
â€œIâ€™m usually like aâ€¦ Mm, like one a.m. max.â€
â€œOne a.m.?â€
â€œYeah.â€
â€œAfter that, what happens? You get cranky?â€
â€œYeah, I just, uh, I canâ€™t be around people anymore.â€
â€œYeah.â€
â€œItâ€™s very rough for me to wannaâ€
â€œWell, also, after one a.m. youâ€™re around after one a.m. people.â€
â€œRight.â€
â€œItâ€™s not a great sort of cross-section.â€
â€œBut youâ€™re an after one a.m. person.â€
â€œI am, no.â€
â€œAll the time?â€
â€œAre you always a one a.m. person? Like, after one a.m. person?â€
â€œUm, Iâ€¦â€
â€œYes, you are.â€
â€œI guess it depends.â€
â€œYou do this all the time.â€
â€œSometimes. But sometimes itâ€™s during the day.â€
â€œSometimes, I meet people andâ€¦â€
â€œOh, oneâ€¦ Right. Thatâ€™s, well, thatâ€™s one p.m.â€
â€œOh, dear. I think weâ€™re both tired.â€
â€œYeah, probably.â€
â€œThe sunâ€™s coming up.â€
â€œI canâ€™t believe I have to get on a plane today.â€
â€œYeah. You gonna try to sleep, or no?â€
â€œNo. Iâ€™m gonna get on the plane and fall asleepâ€
â€œand forget any of this happened.â€
â€œYeah. How longâ€™s the flight?â€
â€œLike ten hours.â€
â€œI donâ€™t know how to make a relationship work.â€
I can do, like, the first part of a relationship.
Thatâ€™s the thing is like when you get older, you kinda likeâ€¦
You start to recognize parts of your life as pieces of bigger patterns.
You know, when youâ€™re younger everythingâ€™s like in the moment but when youâ€™re older itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Okay
This is part of this larger arc
Like, all my relationships basically go the same way.
Theyâ€™re different, but they all kinda follow the same trajectory.
You know, itâ€™s the same pattern.
I get into something itâ€™s super-intense and as soon as I feel like the slightest bit vulnerable or exposed I get insecure and I project that onto the other person find something wrong with them use that as the reason why I have to stop seeing them.
â€œYeah?â€
â€œAnd the second time you see someone do you move in together?â€
â€œNo, the second time we go to couplesâ€™ therapy.â€
Thatâ€™s the pattern every single time!
Every single time, and so Iâ€™m like â€œOkay, so the issue is me.â€
â€œI need to figure my shit out so I gotta go to therapy or somethingâ€
and so I went to a therapist told him my whole life story really opened up to him.
He said it was some commitment thing. Iâ€™m like â€œOh, you put a lotta thought into that one you fucking idiot!â€
And then I had to stop seeing him.
I canâ€™t see some hack therapist.
Itâ€™s like â€œOh, commitment issues? Really?â€
â€œYou coulda said that to nine outta ten people and been right.â€
Like whereâ€™s the training?
But itâ€™s like he was supposed to end the cycle.
I just made him part of it.
Thatâ€™s not whatâ€™s supposed to happen. Itâ€™s kindaâ€¦
Thatâ€™s like goinâ€™ to AA and being likeâ€¦
Finally, some real drinking buddies!
Like, what? No, theyâ€™re supposed to pull you out of the cycle
Not enable it further.
So, what now?
Yeah. Yeah, I wentâ€¦
I try to think about like, why I am the way that I am.
Like, Iâ€™m kinda just aâ€¦ Iâ€™m just like a guardedâ€¦
Person in general like I got a lot ofâ€¦
Walls here.
I try to think about, like, why that is like what made me that way. I think the biggest reason is I have a hearing loss that Iâ€™ve had since I was really young. When I was three-years-old myâ€¦ I failed the hearing test.
â€œAnd my doctor was like: You need hearing aids!â€
â€œAnd I said: No.â€
â€œAnd he said: Oh, okay.â€
â€œHe just like let me do it.â€
Iâ€™m three. Why am I makinâ€™ this choice?
Someone make it for me.
Like, â€œAh, well, youâ€™re an adult. You made your decision.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat? I canâ€™t hear now.â€
â€œI donâ€™t know what the fuck people are saying I didnâ€™t wear them until I was twenty-one.â€
â€œMosâ€¦ Two thirds of my life was just guessing.â€
â€œI didnâ€™t know what people were saying.â€
â€œPeople would say shit and look at me.â€
Iâ€™m like, Ah! Fuck! What? I donâ€™t know.
Yes? What ends this?
Like, get me out of this moment please.
Itâ€™s a fucking nightmare.
Cause you canâ€™t just ask people to repeat themselves constantly.
You canâ€™t just be like, â€œWhat?â€
Itâ€™s annoying. You get like one â€œWhat?â€ per friendship.
Thatâ€™s the limit. After that, they move on.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWeâ€™re gonna hang out with this dude who can hear.â€
And I donâ€™t say that for pity, either.
I donâ€™t want anyone to feel bad for me â€™cause I know I wouldnâ€™t do differently if I was in their situation.
Iâ€™m not better than anyone. I know that.
Iâ€™ve been on the other side of that.
My grandmaâ€™s eighty-four years old rapidly losing her hearing.
Cannot hear shit. This is my grandma.
Like, I love her!
But every time I say something to her sheâ€™s likeâ€¦
My first thought is just die, already!
Like, thatâ€™s my first thought.
And I donâ€™t want anything bad to happen to my grandma but I also donâ€™t wanna have to say what I just said again.
Like, I just said it! You had your chance.
Somethinâ€™s gotta give here.
It might as well be the person who can only eat sweet potatoes.
She had eighty-three good years. I didnâ€™t have that.
My point is I can empathize with my oppressors.
Itâ€™s a weird disability. Like itâ€™s weird.
Like, even the things that are made to help you, people are kinda likeâ€¦
Like, theyâ€™reâ€¦ about like itâ€™s justâ€¦
Like, I watch movies with closed captioning on which is how I watch â€™em.
Iâ€™ve always watched â€™em that way. I never used to tell anyone about it I never used to bring it up because I didnâ€™t wanna be different.
I didnâ€™t wanna be seen as different.
I didnâ€™t wanna call attention to the fact that I was different.
The first time I brought it up I was in college.
My roommate was like â€œHey, you wanna watch a movie?â€
I was like, â€œYeah. Do you mind if we turn on the closed captioning?â€
â€œI got, like, a hearing thingâ€ figuring heâ€™s my friend heâ€™d understand.
And he saidâ€¦
And hereâ€™s the thing itâ€™s not the same.
If it was the same I would just ask for that.
Second of all, Iâ€™m not even sure youâ€™re legally allowed to say no.
Like, this is what theyâ€™re for motherfucker.
Turn â€™em on. Like, Iâ€™m the guy.
Like, what do you think there for? To fuck with you?
For the people at the gym?
Like, Iâ€™m the person that the technology is for.
Turn them oâ€¦ Like thereâ€™s a picture on the back of the box of aâ€¦ Like the ear. Closed captioning.
Thatâ€™s my fucking ear!
Turn â€™em on, you psycho.
Itâ€™s like in no other disability is this even remotely acceptable.
Itâ€™s like, if your friend was in a wheelchair and he was like â€œHey, do you mind if we take the ramp?â€
Would you be likeâ€¦ â€œCome on! The ramp?â€
â€œItâ€™s all the way on the other side of the building, dude.â€
â€œThe normal door is right here.â€
â€œItâ€™s three steps. Canâ€™t you crawl up there?â€
â€œArenâ€™t your arms stronger?â€
â€œCanâ€™t we just pick you up and throw you?â€
â€œIs that fine? You still get there.â€
â€œItâ€™s the same!â€ Itâ€™s not the same.
Turn on the closed captioning man.
I wanna see when acoustic music is playing.
I gotta know. Thatâ€™s how you know whatâ€™s goinâ€™ on in the movies.
You see that parentheses like, Up-tempo techno and you go, Oh! Okay.
Now I see whatâ€™s goinâ€™ on in this David Lynch film.
I was â€¦ I was so lost before.
But you didnâ€™t look like you were about to jump in the shower.
â€œOh, thatâ€™s very niceâ€¦â€
Take it off.
I would just think a lot, so I would just think, I would thinkâ€¦ I would just think all day
Just thoughts.
Itâ€™s comfortable, because you I never would mishear myself.
Like I never have a thought and Iâ€™m like, â€œWait, one more time?â€
Itâ€™s just there. I know the thought.
Thereâ€™s a comfort to that. It gets intense, though because after a while like, the thoughts get weird.
Itâ€™s weird up here itâ€™s just notâ€¦ A lot of weirdâ€¦
A lot of fucked up thoughts. Fucked up.
And the thing is, you donâ€™t know your thoughts are fucked up until you say them out loud and then that look of horror overcomes people and youâ€™re likeâ€¦ Like you donâ€™t know your thought is fucked up until you say, like, â€œHey if we could eat animals why canâ€™t we fuck them?â€ And people are like, â€œWhat?â€
And youâ€™re like â€œOhâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. I was just thinking about me and I feel like Iâ€¦ Iâ€™d rather get fucked than eaten.â€
Like I think if you told an animal, likeâ€¦ â€œHey, weâ€™re about to murder and then eat youâ€
Theyâ€™d be like â€¦ â€œCan you please just fuck me?â€
I would think about suicide a lot.
Notâ€¦ I didnâ€™t wanna do it I just thought, likeâ€¦ If I did it what would a funny way be?
Like, what would a funny way be? I donâ€™t wanna go out boring.
Like, what would be a funny end to all of this?
I think it would be funny if you go to a water park and you go to the top of a reallyâ€¦ like, a tall waterslide and, like right as youâ€™re about to go down you just blow your head off and make the corpse go, likeâ€¦ through the whole course of the slide like, all the tunnels and the turns and justâ€¦ just like splashes in the bottom of the pool.
All the kids are screaming, parents are like, sprinting towards the pool.
You know, funny!
I think you would think that was funny even if you were there even if you were at the water park even if that was your kid in the pool.
Once you got the kid outta the pool you dried him off you put him in the car on the ride home youâ€™d be likeâ€¦
Thatâ€™s a pretty good bit. Like, I think you would recognize the level of commitment alone is impressive like, â€œOh my God! He brought a gun to a water park?â€
â€œHe waited in line up the steps for like twenty minutes?â€
â€œHe had goggles on, why the fuck did he have goggles on?â€
Who cares if you get water in your eyes if yourâ€¦ brain is exploded?
â€œIâ€™m gonna miss that guy.â€ You start missing me.
You feel that kinship through the attention to detail.
Fucked up thought.
And thatâ€™s just a thought that I had.
Iâ€™m not tryinâ€™ to make light of something that people, you know â€™cause itâ€™s itâ€¦ Suicide is a tough subject.
Thereâ€™s some subjects people think are just never funny.
And I hear that Iâ€™m not like a sociopath Iâ€™m not like â€œEverything is funny! Fuck you!â€
No, itâ€™s like you know I think about it I donâ€™t wanna hurt anybody.
But suicideâ€™s a tough one itâ€™s a tough one because people get offended at suicide jokes but itâ€™s never suicidal people.
Itâ€™s always like suicide-adjacent people.
Like, suicidal peopleâ€¦ Love suicide jokes.
Right? You know why? Causeâ€¦ Thatâ€™s their thing.
Like everybody has a thing.
Like, if youâ€™re married maybe you like a joke about marriage.
â€˜Cause you hear it, youâ€™re like â€œOh honey, thatâ€™s so us or whatever.â€
Suicidal person hears a suicide joke, itâ€™s the same thing.
Itâ€™s like â€œIâ€™m not gonna tell anyone but that is so me!â€
Youâ€™re gonna find out in a note how good that joke really was and then regret not laughing more later because it is on the money.
Itâ€™s cathartic.
Like, if youâ€™re dealing with those private, painful personal dark thoughts to hear them talked about and made light of in a public forum thatâ€™s a cathathatâ€™s catharsis.
You feel connected to someone outside your own mind.
Thatâ€™s a positive emotion.
Iâ€™m not gonna take that away from someone just to spare someone else a moment of discomfort.
But I get why people get upset.
I had a dude once, he was like â€œThatâ€™s not funny.â€
â€œYou should never joke about that.â€
â€œMy nephew killed himself. You think thatâ€™s funny?â€
I was like â€œWhat? No.â€ I was like, â€œWhat? No.â€
â€œNo, thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m talking about at all.â€
â€œThatâ€™s not funny.â€
â€œThatâ€™s incredibly sad.â€
â€œIâ€™m sad right now hearing about it, you know â€™cause your nephewâ€¦â€
â€œWouldâ€™ve loved that joke.â€
Itâ€™s like, yeah, my target market is missing, tragic.
Also, if he wouldâ€™ve heard this joke he wouldnâ€™t have felt alone as he obviously did and thatâ€™s really my point is if you donâ€™t like something just let it go and hit the people that itâ€™s meant for.
Thatâ€™s not for everybody.
There are people who are gonna hate it. Thereâ€™s people right now who are like â€œDude, I fucking hate this joke and itâ€™s gone on way too long and I just want it to end.â€
And itâ€™s likeâ€¦ All right
and now you know how suicidal people feel about life.
We want them to stick it out a little bit longer.
I think you can, too.
The joke was about empathy the whole time.
â€œHey.â€
Hey.
â€œI was just about to call ya.â€
I was gonna call you. How ya doinâ€™?
â€œIâ€™m good.â€
Yeah?
â€œYeah. How wasâ€¦ How was your day?â€
It was good. Actually, I had a really good day.
â€œYeah? Tell me about it.â€
Well, I got up and I actually like, ranâ€¦
Well, I did actually two hours ofâ€¦ I did yoga and Pilates today.
â€œBoth? Youâ€™re trying toâ€¦â€
Yeah.
â€œYou were tryinâ€™ to get more of those in there.â€
No, I absolutely smashed it. I donâ€™t evenâ€¦
Like, tomorrow Iâ€™m just gonna look ridiculously good.
â€œYeah, no, look, tomorrow you earn popcorn and whatever else.â€
Yeah, exactly, Iâ€™m gonna haveâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna make a lemon square.
â€œOkay. You know how to make those?â€
Yeah, I havenâ€™t told you. I do know how to make lemon squares.
â€œIs that your thing?â€
â€œThatâ€™s kind ofâ€¦â€
Yeah
And I know how to bake sweet potatoes as well.
â€œOkay.â€
Yeah. Thatâ€™s kind of it.
â€œI could do one of those Iâ€™m not gonna tell you which one.â€
I bet you could bake a sweet potato but I bet you donâ€™t know that you should put little holes in it.
â€œWith a fork? you punch with a fork?â€
Oh, you must. You absolutely must.
â€œI know. I know a thing or twoâ€
And Iâ€™m not sure if you wrap your potatoes in foil because there are, like, people that wrap them and people that donâ€™t
â€œWhich one are you?â€
Youâ€™ve got to wrap.
Youâ€™ve got to wrap and poke.
â€œGotta wrap and poke.â€
Yeah, â€™cause the steams gotta come out but not too much.
I donâ€™t know if you letif you let all your steam come out.
Is that a plan on lemon squares too, of just the sweet potatoes?
No, thatâ€™s a whole different thing.
I canâ€™t tell you that recipe.
â€œThatâ€™s secret.â€
â€œAll right, how long do I have to wait toâ€¦ To find out then?â€
What? My lemon square thing?
â€œYeah.â€
I donâ€™t know. My dead great grandmother told it to me soâ€¦
â€œOh, God.â€
Iâ€™m probably not gonna ever tell you.
â€œThatâ€™sâ€¦ I didnâ€™t know I was stepping into an heirloom.â€
No, itâ€™s fine. She lived a long and healthy life.
â€œItâ€™s a family crest, I was trying to pry it from you.â€
Yeah. What are you up to?
â€œYou know, Iâ€™m about toâ€¦ About to jump in the shower and then head out. I answered un-showered.â€
But you donâ€™t look like youâ€™re about to jump in the shower.
Oh, thatâ€™s very nice of you to say.
â€œTake it off.â€
â€œYou wanna come in with me?â€
No.
â€œI think I would sacrifice this for this phone.â€
When was the last time you showered?
â€œIâ€™m tryinâ€™ to give you an exact hour amount.â€
â€œI think eighteen hours ago?â€
Oh, eighteen hours.
I thought you were gonna be, like two hours ago.
Are you, like, one of those people that showerâ€¦
Like when we see each other again, are you just gonna beâ€¦
Like if I come in on the plane are you gonna be like
You have to have a shower?
Iâ€™m gonna come andâ€¦
I always think thatâ€™s so weird. Itâ€™s like, canâ€™t we just not do that?
Like, I know Iâ€™ve been on a plane, but likeâ€¦
â€œIâ€™m gonna have you guess shower or no shower.â€
Youâ€™re gonna make me shower though when we see each other again?
â€œYou should shower for sure.â€
But like if I havenâ€™t seen you for all this time and I just get off the plane are you gonna be likeâ€¦
â€œYou have to have a shower?â€
This is a deal breaker for me.
â€œFor you?â€
â€œOh. If I make you shower?â€
Yes! Like straightaway.
â€œNo, I trust your sort of, uh, judgment on that.â€
Okay, fine, Iâ€™ll just shower before.
â€œThatâ€™s up to you. Iâ€™m not gonnaâ€¦ Iâ€™m not gonna tell you what to do. I mean I will judge youâ€¦â€
Yeah, donâ€™t control me. Stop it.
â€œYeah, no moreâ€¦ Yeah, that comes later.â€
No.
â€œThat comes later.â€
â€œI like looking at your face.â€
Shut up.
â€œNo?â€
â€œYou can see your face too the little square in the bottom.â€
No, I look like a thumb.
â€œThatâ€™s â€™cause your thumbâ€™s in the way.â€
It is not. I justâ€¦
You look likeâ€¦ You look really dewy.
Youâ€™re like all smooth and stuff.
â€œJews are smooth?â€
No! Youâ€™re all dewy.
Not about you being Jewâ€¦
You always bring it back to being Jewish. No.
â€œYou said I looked Jewyâ€¦â€
No, likeâ€¦
â€œAnd then you said I look smooth.â€
No, dewy like a pancake.
â€œChewy?â€
No! Dewy.
Dewy. Like you moisturize a lot. Doesnâ€™t matter. Whatever.
â€œIs that a translation thing?â€
No, no, â€œIs it a languageâ€¦ Is it a cultural thing?â€
Dewy. Do you guys not say dewy?
â€œNo, Jewy means likeâ€¦â€
Dewy, like smooth.
â€œJewish shit.â€
Okay, sorry.
â€œIâ€™m glad we clarified that â€™cause that could be a problem.â€
No, you know, like a dewy Jew.
â€œRight. Is thatâ€¦ Wait are we pancake or Holocaust?â€
Stop.
Youâ€™re such an idiot.
â€œWhich Jewyâ€¦ you gotta specify.â€
Shut up.
â€œâ€™cause now Iâ€™m completely lost.â€
â€œIs that a British thing?
I had my eyebrows tweezed today.
â€œOh, okay! It was yoga Pilates and eyebrows.â€
Yeah. I just went in this place opposite and I feltâ€¦
You know, like when somebody like, does something for you and you feel like all warm and gooey inside?
Like this woman took real care about like, tweezing my eyebrows.
And she was like showing me how to draw them in and stuff and I just, I donâ€™t know it was really sweet.
â€œDid she tweeze them or thread them?â€
No, she was tweezing them. Yeah.
â€œOh, tweezwith the tweezers? I donâ€™t know whatâ€¦ I see, like, women go into places and then they come outâ€¦ I just donâ€™t really know what happens in there.â€
You know we had a lovely little moment. She was likeâ€¦
Hereâ€™s why theyâ€™re all like, wobbly and allâ€¦
And I was like, â€œYeahâ€. She was like â€œYeah, theyâ€™re little twixers but we canâ€¦ We can do something.â€
â€œYeah, the threading shit is likeâ€¦â€
Yeah.
I do do that sometimes, but I just sneeze and cryâ€¦ quite a lot.
â€œItâ€™s really hard to doâ€.
Yeah, it seems insane.
â€œThe people who do that how do theyâ€¦â€
Itâ€™s insane and Iâ€™m always really scared theyâ€™re gonna take off your eyelashes â€™cause itâ€™s literally like they get this piece of thread and just likeâ€¦
â€œAre they the most skilled people on the planet?â€
Yeah.
â€œLike, they go in there quicklyâ€¦â€
Oh my God. Wait, I have to tell you something.
I wentâ€¦ One time I went to the Korean spa and the woman scrubbed me so hard that I bled.
â€œOn yourâ€¦ eyeyour eyebrows?â€
No, not on myâ€¦
No, obviously not on my eyebrow.
â€œShe scrubbed you?â€
Scrubbed me so hard â€œWhere were you bleeding at?â€
I got herpes a little while ago. Who gives a shit?
Thatâ€™s not a subject people are like, super open about.
Like, I like bringinâ€™ it up because, like, notyou know anytime I bring it up people always wanna ask questions.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh, you got it?â€
Itâ€™s like, â€œYeah.â€ Do you know how you got it?
Yeah, pretty good idea.
Howâ€™d you get it?
I was like, I donâ€™t know. What do you wanna know, the position?
Like, howâ€™d I get it? Iâ€™m not a loser.
Like, thatâ€™s how. Iâ€™m thirty-two.
Okay, if youâ€™re thirty, you better either be married or have herpes.
Like, pick one. Commit to something commit to a person or a way of life. Like, who are you?
Three decades nothing to show for it?
Figure it the fuck out. Marriage or herpes.
Pick. Pick!
A lot of my friends got married.
I got herpes.
At least mine is gonna last forever.
People get fucked up about it, though.
They get, like, fucked up about it! Like, people get fucked up!
They hear that they have it, they get fucked up, and you shouldnâ€™t.
Itâ€™s not that big of a deal.
But thereâ€™s like a sense of shame associated with it.
â€˜Cause society will imbue you with a sense of shame for something thatâ€™s on your body.
Which is, like, thatâ€™s body shaming.
Thatâ€™s textbook body shaming.
Itâ€™s on my body and youâ€™re shaming me for it?
Thatâ€™s literally what body shaming is.
No one gets behind that cause. Like, no oneâ€™s evâ€¦
Whereâ€™s that Dove ad campaign?
Whereâ€™s that brave Instagram post?
That would be brave.
Thatâ€™s a brave Instagram post. A fresh outbreak.
Woke up like this. Like, thatâ€™s fucking brave as shit.
Thatâ€™s way braver than you with no makeup.
I donâ€™t know how youâ€™re keeping score on bravery but Iâ€™m pretty sure that that wins.
Itâ€™s not even that big of a deal.
Right? Itâ€™s like thatâ€™s something I learned.
Itâ€™s not as big of a deal as they make it seem so I feel like if you have it you shouldnâ€™t let yourself get fucked up about it.
Like donâ€™t let it affect your sense of self.
Itâ€™s fine.
If you donâ€™t have it, get it!
Just get it!
Then itâ€™s over, thatâ€™s it. Youâ€™re done!
You know what I mean? Like itâ€™s kind of better.
Like, I used to not have it. And now I do and itâ€™s likeâ€¦ I remember I used to always worry about getting itâ€¦
But now I donâ€™t. Thatâ€™s pretty nice.
Thereâ€™s something liberating about that.
Like, itâ€™s liberating to not have to worry anymore.
Also, if we all got it, then itâ€™s kind of like no one has it anymore which isâ€¦ Thatâ€™s basically a cure.
Make it the new normal and thatâ€™s it.
I get a lot of questions. Like a lotâ€¦ People alwaysâ€¦
My friend, she was like â€œIs it hard to date now?â€
Is it hard to date now? What do you mean now?
Like, what made you think this was easy before?
You think herpes is some new problem?
Like, my personality much bigger problem than herpes.
Herpes is like number eighteen on the list of fuckinâ€™ things in the way.
What, do you think itâ€™s uncomfortable?
Oh, you think itâ€™s an uncomfortable conversation?
Listen, if Iâ€™m dating someone and they think thatâ€™s uncomfortable wait till I deconstruct your sense of self so I feel superior.
Thatâ€™s way more uncomfortable.
Wait till she hears my fucked-up perspective on shit.
Look, any girl in the world would rather hear her boyfriend say â€œHey, I have HSV-twoâ€ thanâ€¦
â€œHey you know, nine-eleven was just occupy Wall Street done right.â€
Thatâ€™s way more uncomfortable than a very treatable STD that everyone already kind of has anyway.
Is dating hard? I donâ€™t know.
Sure. Depends who you are.
I donâ€™t like the first date. The first date is like, I donâ€™t like it.
I donâ€™t like hanginâ€™ out with strangers.
Itâ€™s like two hours with a stranger.
I donâ€™t drink either so itâ€™s like what do you do?
Dinner? I go to dinner.
Thatâ€™s what I do. Dinner.
Itâ€™s too much pressure on the first date.
Dinner?
Itâ€™s just you and a menu and this person.
Good luck.
Just sittinâ€™ there in your little section.
You gotta make small talk off the menu.
Sheâ€™s like â€œOh, what should I get?â€ Itâ€™s like, I donâ€™t care.
I donâ€™t love you.
Chicken.
Oh, they got glazed carrots, letâ€™s get â€™em!
Roasted Brussels sprouts. Yeah, great.
Weâ€™re gettinâ€™ roasted Brussels sprouts.
Remember when we were kids Brussels sprouts were like the worst thing and now we all, like, love â€™em?
Weâ€™re all fuckinâ€™ sellouts.
I donâ€™t wanna date someone I donâ€™t love.
I wanna date someone I love.
Thatâ€™s the move.
You wanna date someone you love!
Who do I love? Not a lotta people.
I guess where all that Freudian shit comes from â€™cause itâ€™s like yeah, your mom is the best option.
Like on a love levelâ€¦ I know itâ€™s weird and gross
We donâ€™t do it, but, like, wouldnâ€™t it be awesome if we did?
Like, imagine a universe where that was totally the deal.
Like, thatâ€™s a better universe.
Itâ€™s a betterâ€¦ Like just come out of the womb day one like, â€œFound her.â€ Like, thatâ€™s better.
I donâ€™t need to fuck with strangers I got the oxytocin queen right here.
I guess thatâ€™s why the mom sits up front at the wedding cause itâ€™s like â€œWell, it wouldâ€™ve been you but blech so I had to go find someone I never knew. I had to turn a stranger into the love of my life.â€
On a love level though, like, who do I love more than my mom?
Nobody.
Who does she love more than me? Nobody.
It is right there.
Itâ€™s like we both love each other more than anything letâ€™s figure this out. We canâ€™t figure this out?
Thereâ€™s no permutation where this can fuckinâ€™ work?
Itâ€™s frustrating. Sheâ€™s single too, not that it matters but itâ€™s like, sheâ€™s single, Iâ€™m not saying, like, â€œOh I have a chanceâ€
Iâ€™m like, she, my mom, is single.
Sheâ€™s, like, alone. I donâ€™t want my mom to be alone.
I want myâ€¦ I want her to be with someone that sheâ€™s into.
And Iâ€™m not saying, like â€œOh, my mom is into meâ€ but if we were not related she would be.
Like, in another universe I would be her type.
And I know itâ€™s weird to think but to be fair I only think that because she told me that so donâ€™t shoot the messenger.
Sheâ€™s like â€œOh, you would so be my type.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, what do you want me to do with that?â€
â€œYeah, I wish I could. I would love to.â€
â€œI would love to give you me. That would make me so happy.â€
â€œFor you to be with a guy who loves you who is so far out of your league.â€
That would be nice. And I am outta my momâ€™s league.
Iâ€™m not saying that arrogantly I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m like the best looking person.
I just know I would never consider sleeping with a sixty-one year old woman who looked like that unless she were my mom. Like, thatâ€™s her only in. Iâ€™d have to really give a shit about how happy it made her. Like, random sixty-year-old lady, get the fuck outta here!
But my mom, itâ€™s likeâ€¦
Well, yeah I want my mom to get fucked.
You want your mom to get fucked.
You just donâ€™t wanna know when.
But I wanna know that itâ€™s happening for sure I just donâ€™t wanna know when it hapâ€¦ I just I donâ€™t her to like, walk out of her bedroom, likeâ€¦
Like I donâ€™t want that moment.
But I wanna know that it is happening and what better way to now that somethingâ€™s happening for sure than to just do it yourself.
And thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m saying is I wish I could guarantee for her what I know she deserves.
For her. Itâ€™s not even for me.
I donâ€™t win this, she wins. Right?
Because any reasonable person would admit you would rather fuck your kid than your parent.
Thatâ€™s not controversial. Thatâ€™s not controversial.
That isâ€¦ You would rather fuck your kid than your parent.
For sure. People try to fuck their kids all the time.
Nobody tries to fuck their parents.
You never read that in the news like a ring of parent fuckers was broken up by the FBI in a sting operation.
Uh, parent fucking is rampant in Hollywood and Washington and the music business andâ€¦
Anyway, my point is I donâ€™t think anyone gives a shit about the herpes anymore.
â€œHeyâ€
Hey
Why are you still up?
Why are you still up? Itâ€™s my bedtime.
â€œYeah.â€
Youâ€™ve been out?
â€œKind of. Whatâ€¦â€
Youâ€™re drunk and Iâ€™m asleep.
â€œDefine out.â€
I donâ€™t know, like out.
â€œI got a falafel with a friend.â€
You got a falafel?
â€œIs that out?â€
Uhâ€¦ Itâ€¦
Do you have, like bits of falafel in your mouth?
I always have like have likeâ€¦
â€œRight now?â€
Like, I donâ€™t really get falafel. Itâ€™s just likeâ€¦ like eating, like, dust.
â€œItâ€™s a little chalky, I admit that.â€
Itâ€™s so dry. I just donâ€™t understand the falafel obsession.
â€œYeah, I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s an obsession as much as it isâ€¦â€
â€œIt was open.â€
Oh, right.
â€œIâ€™m obsessed with places that are open.â€
Do you ever, like, um, order something on delivery and then youâ€™re like you go past it in the day and youâ€™re, like, â€œWhat the fuck?â€
Like, â€œI would never order from that place?â€
Or, like, â€œIâ€™d never go into that place and eat.â€
â€œOh, yeah, yeah, yeah. â€™cause itâ€¦ It has theâ€¦â€
â€˜Cause itâ€™s disgusting.
â€œRight.â€
â€œOn the internet itâ€™s only the number of stars.â€
Yeah.
â€œAnd, so, theyâ€™re like, okay, four-starâ€¦ star rating on restaurants is, like, the only time I trust random people in the world.â€
â€œLike, Oh, four and a half stars like, then it has to be good.â€
â€œBut itâ€™s like these are the same people whoâ€¦ are on trains and vote.â€
Are you one of those people who like, always has to look up the restaurant before you go and see if itâ€™s nice?
â€œIâ€¦ yeah. Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™mâ€¦â€
I can tell.
â€œIâ€™m a four and a half star or above.â€
Why do you look so scrumptious?
â€œI look scrunched up right now?â€
You look scrummy.
â€œWhat does that mean?â€
Like if I was there right now Iâ€™d snog you.
â€œScrummy?â€
Yeah, like scrumptious.
â€œOh, I see. Is this a good thing?â€
Yeah.
â€œOkay.â€
Yeah, like I wanna snigâ€¦ Snig you no snog you. Snog and a kissâ€¦ No, whatâ€™s a snig? A snog and a kiss is a snigu.
â€œAll right.â€
I mean, Iâ€™m really tired.
â€œThese areâ€¦ these are all new expressions to me.â€
No, I justâ€¦ I think Iâ€™m weird jet lag.
I also came home and my brotherâ€¦ has done something to the toilet.
â€œWhat did he do?â€
Heâ€™s been staying here when I went awayâ€¦ I donâ€™t know, but itâ€™s making a weird noise.
And when we were kids, like every time we go on holiday we justâ€¦ Like my mom would have to get, um, a coat hanger and put it on the toilet because itâ€¦ Theyâ€™re just so long.
â€œSheâ€™d have to use a coat hanger for the toilet?â€
A coat hanger, yeah, or like a piece of bamboo if weâ€™re on holiday.
And I know heâ€™s done something to it, and heâ€¦
â€œWhereâ€™s bamboo readily available?â€
Itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s not here.
â€œWhere do you have to go?â€
Itâ€™s tracking it down.
â€œYeah. How is your mom?â€
My mom?
â€œYeah.â€
Sheâ€™s good.
â€œWas it good seeing her?â€
Yeah. Yeah, I went round for dinner.
Theyâ€™ve just moved house.
â€œDid they?â€
Yeah. My dadâ€™s havingâ€¦
â€œOh, right.â€
Like a bit of a mid-life crisis â€™cause theyâ€™ve moved to a smaller house.
â€œYeah, you were saying something about that with the moving.â€
Yeah.
â€œSo heâ€™sâ€¦ Heâ€™s freaking out?â€
Heâ€™s freaking out â€™cause he doesnâ€™t have, like, whatâ€¦ He doesnâ€™t, yeah. Itâ€™s a smaller house. And he thinks heâ€™s like getting old and heâ€™s gonna die in a small house.
â€œWell, he is, I mean, I donâ€™t know.â€
I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s like, I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s like a thing, itâ€™s like, I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s like heâ€™s giving up. But heâ€™s buying itâ€¦ I donâ€™t know.
Theyâ€™re getting another one.
â€œHeâ€™s giving up?â€
This is all. Heâ€™s just an idiot.
Yeah. Heâ€™s not an idiot but itâ€™s just stupid stuff toâ€¦
â€œRight.â€
Worry about.
Yeah, I think about that, like, Iâ€¦
â€œYou know, you look at people who are, likeâ€¦ in the mid-life age you know, and you go likeâ€¦â€
â€œAh, that looks like it sucks.â€
â€œAnd youâ€™re like, Wait, thatâ€™s next.â€
Yeah, maybe for you, not for me.
â€œWell, I mean itâ€™s nextâ€¦â€
Iâ€™m a young little spring chicken.
â€œYeah, but that ends.â€
Whatever. No. I was thinking that, likeâ€¦
Am I gonna get to a certain age where no one fancies me anymore and then I was just, like, no.
â€œYou say no?â€
I donâ€™t thinkâ€¦ I donâ€™t think itâ€™s gonna happen.
â€œThatâ€™s because youâ€™re young.â€
No, but I think, likeâ€¦
â€œThatâ€™s a young thing to think.â€
No, no, but, like, evenâ€¦
No, like, I donâ€™t know.
I was just thinking, like Iâ€™m sure someone will be up for it when Iâ€™m, like, forty.
â€œNo, totally. But thenâ€¦â€
â€œBut just the selection of people gets weirder.â€
No, they donâ€™t.
â€œI think it does.â€
â€œRight?â€
I have a hard time with intimacy.
I have, like, intimacy issues.
Any time I get into, like an intimate moment I feel like justâ€¦ I gotta get the fuck outta there.
â€œItâ€™s just a feeling any time I see vulnerabilityâ€
I gotta get the fuck outta there.
And your brain is really good at justifying how you feel so if you feel like you gotta leave a situation then your brain will find reasons why you should.
So itâ€™ll come back with all this intel, like reasons to leave.
And itâ€™s hard to know if those are like legitimate red flags or just you justifying some weird insecurity.
Itâ€™s hard toâ€¦ To discern between the two â€œand thatâ€™s where I think therapy can be helpful.â€
Therapy kinda helps you like unmask your phobia. Like, any phobia youâ€™re having therapy kinda gets like underneath it.
Therapy, to me, is kinda like the last scene of Scooby Doo.
That last sceâ€¦ every episode of Scooby Doo is the same. The whole episode theyâ€™re like â€œAh, itâ€™s a ghost!â€
And they take the mask off theyâ€™re likeâ€¦
â€œOh, itâ€™s the guy who owns the bakery,â€ or whatever.
Thatâ€™s what I think therapy does forâ€¦
For your emotions.
Youâ€™re in a relationship and youâ€™re likeâ€¦ I donâ€™t know, sheâ€™s a little boring and therapy is likeâ€¦
Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, my parents never showed me what love looked like.â€
â€œI thought she was bad at telling stories.â€
Turns out I have no foundation.
Iâ€™m broken irreparably from the inside.
â€œIâ€™m flying blind without a map.â€
Iâ€™m replicating a power dynamic instead of reciprocity.
Silly me.
I thought she used the wrong form of â€youâ€™reâ€ in a text message.
Turns out I downloaded my sexual identity from movies.
You ever do that? You ever think youâ€™re a person â€œand youâ€™re actually an amalgamation of projections youâ€™ve absorbed over thirty-two years?â€
That is brutal.
I do think that thereâ€™s like a weird impact, that, like, movies can have.
Maybe it just exacerbates superficialities.
I donâ€™t like when I get into that when Iâ€™m, like tricked by superficial shit
Like Iâ€¦
Even when Iâ€™m not like, attracted to somebody Iâ€™m, likeâ€¦
Whatâ€™s goinâ€™ on?
When Iâ€™m attracted to someone Iâ€™m, like, â€œOh, nice face.â€
And then Iâ€™m gonna, what, overrate the ideas that come out of it?
Right? â€˜Cause, like the face and the body thatâ€™s just like, the marketing team of the self.
And when Iâ€™m attracted to that Iâ€™m being, like, tricked.
I feel like Iâ€™m being tricked.
Like, Iâ€™m on the phone at four in the morning with an infomercialâ€¦ Like, Hey, I saw your thing. Iâ€™d like to bâ€¦ Itâ€™sâ€¦
No! Wait till you see the thing!
But you canâ€™t see the thing.
You canâ€™t see the thing immediately.
You have toâ€¦ Itâ€™s theâ€¦ You just see the face and the body.
Whatâ€™s the personality like? Thatâ€™s way more important.
But that takes time, it takes patience, it takes energy it takes focus to notice.
The face is right there.
Maybe the personalityâ€™s fucked up.
I think if you have a fucked up personality you should have a fucked up face.
I donâ€™t think you should get to have it the other way.
Like, when I look at your face I donâ€™t wanna see flesh.
I wanna see, like, nine months living in a one bedroom apartment with you, like, here.
Like thatâ€™s whatâ€¦ Thatâ€™s what this should be.
All this shit. Hair.
I donâ€™t wanna see hair.
What is hair?
â€œOh, you have nice hair.â€ Who gives a shit? Hair?
Hair is protein that arbitrarily grows out of your head against your will.
And you have nice that? Awesome.
Itâ€™s an aesthetic thing.
If something is gonna grow out of your head I donâ€™t wanna see hair I wanna see like, long flowing locks of your ability to keep a secret.
Thatâ€™s what should come outta your head.
That way someone flips it back â€œOh, I can trust that person.â€
And we can continue not trusting bald people like we normally do except we wouldnâ€™t be superficial shitheads for it, weâ€™d be right.
Yeah, I canâ€™t trust that dude.
He hasâ€¦ He doesnâ€™t have the secret-keeping substance coming out of his skull.
Fuck that bald asshole! And youâ€™d be right!
That would be a legitimate thing to say as opposed to a low-key hate crime like it is now.
You canâ€™t call someone a bald asshole.
I didnâ€™t pick that.
Thereâ€™s all sorts of things I can do to become more attractive, too.
I can, like, make myself more attractive.
I can work out, I can get in shape.
That would make me more attractive.
I can get abs, people would be more attracted to me which is weird because all abs mean is I did this a lot.
Like, thatâ€™s literally all it means is I tricked my body into thinking it was building a house.
Like, thatâ€™s what abs are itâ€™s an exploitation of an evolutionary glitch.
People go, â€œOh, he did this a lot.â€
Heâ€™ll make a great date.
Like, how? How does that track?
You should only be able to get abs by doing something good.
Like, you should have toâ€¦ In order to get aâ€¦
You should have to like help the elderly, that would make sense.
Like, you help an old lady cross the street and get ripped
Like, okay, yeah, sure, I buy that.
That way you see a guy on the beach with washboard abs you can be like â€œOh, well he loves his grandmaâ€
Like, you would know something about him other than he did this a lot after work four times a week.
He did the side-to-side one probably.
Look at that.
He probably used a medicine ball.
What a cool guy! Itâ€™s fucking stupid.
But we are attracted to these things.
Weâ€™re attracted to, you know, what weâ€™re attracted to and as a society when we are all attracted to certain things we create this, like external value system and when you live inside of that you internalize that as your own.
So, you feel a sense of internal pride or shame based on how closely you correlate to thatâ€¦ That value system.
So, people get fucked up about how they look thatâ€™s well documented. People also getâ€¦
Itâ€™s weird like, people take pride like, thereâ€™s a weird pride people take in how they loo Like, thereâ€™s men who take, like priâ€¦
They have, like, dick pride like pride in their diâ€¦ Likeâ€¦
My fuckinâ€™ dick! Like, they talk about their dick like itâ€™s a son that graduated from Harvard.
Like, whereâ€™s the prideâ€¦
My fuckinâ€™ dick!
Oh, my biitâ€™s not even my dick. Iâ€™m its body.
Like what are you talkâ€¦ Likeâ€¦
My fuckinâ€™ dick.
My big-ass diâ€¦ Itâ€™s like, â€œSo?â€
Howâ€™d you get it?
Itâ€™s like, â€œDude it just showed up!â€
Your dick should only be as big as your heart.
And it should only be as girthy as your capacity for change.
That way you see a fat dick you goâ€¦
â€œOh, thatâ€™s a spiritually open malleable human being.â€
You sit on a fat dick I can feel his open mindedness stretching me out.
That desire he has to transcend his past mistakes.
It feels good.
It makes me feel full.
Iâ€™m attracted to things Iâ€™m attracted toâ€¦ Eyes. I like eyes.
Iâ€™m attracted to eyes. Not, like, in a bag but, like, on a head. Eyes. I like my eyes on heads.
Two eyes for every one head. Thatâ€™s the ratio that I like.
You can have whatever ratio you want.
I like eyes. But even thatâ€™s weird.
I like the eye, but then itâ€™s likeâ€¦
â€œOh, now I wanna like, fuck you. Why?â€
â€œâ€˜Cause you have nice eyes?â€ Thatâ€™s a weird leap to make.
To go, like â€œOh, yeah, these eyes are cool.â€
â€œLetâ€™s fuck the otherâ€¦â€ This other part of you.
Itâ€™s not even the sameâ€¦ Itâ€™s not even on the same part of the body.
Itâ€™s a different part.
The vagina. And itâ€™s like I like it, but itâ€™s likeâ€¦
I just it doesnâ€™t tell me anything about you.
I donâ€™t know you. I donâ€™t know whaâ€¦
You know what I mean? Like the vaginâ€¦ Like theâ€¦
I donâ€™t wanna fuck a vagina.
I would much rather fuck like a warm, wet sense of discipline.
Like, I wanna go down on your long-term focus.
I wannaâ€¦ I wanna eat out your determination.
I wanna make your perseverance squirt.
Thatâ€™s a much more appealing activity.
I wanna shove my personality into your determination and then reach around and tickle your integrity like, thatâ€™s kind of the world I wanna live in.
I just hope your integrity doesnâ€™t include your ability to keep a secret because that is a phobia of mine.
Iâ€™m not a perfect person.
Itâ€™s all fear.
I mean, all this shitâ€¦ All this shit I talk about, itâ€™s all fear.
It comes from aâ€¦
Deep rooted sense of fear. Iâ€™m afraid.
Iâ€™m afraid to get close to somebody.
Iâ€™m afraid to lose the person I get close to.
â€œIâ€™m afraid they can hurt me in a way that no one else can.â€
â€œWhy do you look so scrumptious?â€
â€œI look scrunched up right now?â€
Youâ€™re scrummy.
â€œWhat does that mean?â€
Like, if I was there right now Iâ€™d snog you.
Iâ€™m afraid that if I let someone in past the walls that Iâ€™ve built up for myself that theyâ€™llâ€¦
See parts of myself that I havenâ€™t accepted or I donâ€™t like, or parts of me that are fucked up, or flawed or broken, or weird, or wrong or inadequate or boring.
Parts of myself that are missing, likeâ€¦
Whereâ€™s that part of your personality?
Like, I donâ€™t know.
Maybe itâ€™ll show me a part of myself that I havenâ€™tâ€¦
That I havenâ€™t even looked atâ€¦ Itâ€™s all fear.
And so I push people away.
And itâ€™s not in, like, fun ways. Itâ€™s not likeâ€¦
Iâ€™m not like Iâ€™m rolling them down the sidewalk in an office chair.
Itâ€™sâ€¦ Sometimes itâ€™s harsh.
And, you know, this is something I have to reckon with.
But itâ€™s just because Iâ€™m afraid of the alternative.
â€œAnd so what do you do about it?â€
I just try to be honest.
â€œThat might be the funniest thing youâ€™ve ever said.â€
You think this is honest?
Honestyâ€™s, like, itâ€™s being open and being vulnerable.
Itâ€™s not just standing in front of everyone and telling them that you fucking suck. Fuck off, dude!
Like get the fuck over yourself.
Itâ€™s fuckinâ€™ boring. Like we all feel this shit.
Itâ€™s, like, we donâ€™t need a fuckinâ€™ whole big song and dance about it.
Youâ€™ve constructed this whole elaborate way to never change.
And theyâ€™re not even jokes itâ€™s not even fucking jokes.
Itâ€™s just you talking about your problem.
Thereâ€™sâ€¦ Where is the funny in this?
Show me. None of theâ€¦
Like none of this has been funny.
None of this has been funny!
Itâ€™s just been you masturbating up here the entiâ€¦
Itâ€™s just been watching you jerk yourself off.
And Iâ€™m really sick of it.
I know you think that thereâ€™s somebody out there youâ€™re helping them and someoneâ€™s gonna be able to connect to your problems andâ€¦ and maybe they will but thatâ€™s not why you do it, is it?
Itâ€™sâ€¦ You do it for their validation.
And the more you get, the better it feels.
Itâ€™s the same dynamic as in all of your relationships.
You just come in here, you say whatever the fuck you want and then you leave like a fuckinâ€™ pussy!

(EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC ENDS)
DREW MICHAEL: Itâ€™s nice to see you people. I have a hard time with people, so here we go.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Well, itâ€™s always been hard for me to connect with people throughout my whole life, and I think thereâ€™s, you know, a lot of reasons for that. Um, I have a hearing loss that Iâ€™ve had since I was a kid. When I was three years oldâ€¦ I failed a hearing test. I took a hearing test and the doctor said, â€œYou failed the hearing test.â€ Well, I didnâ€™t know what he said, butâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€¦he said something, and my parents got upset, so I assumed I didnâ€™t nail it, andâ€¦ So he told my parents, he said, â€œThis kid needs hearing aids.â€ And so instead of doing that, they didnâ€™t. So we justâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€¦coasted until I was 21. I didnâ€™t wear them till I was 21. I wore them for like a week when I was in fifth grade, but then this girl I had a crush on asked about them. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhatâ€™s in your ear?â€ I was like, â€œWell, thatâ€™s the end of that forever.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œSo Iâ€™ll figureâ€¦ Iâ€™ll figure it out.â€ It instilled this kinda sense of shame in me. You know, I took it as something was wrong with me. I put it on myself. I go, â€œI must be fucked up.â€ And then Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, my doctor fucked up.â€ And then my friends were like, â€œNo, dude, your parents, your parents fucked up.â€ And itâ€™s like, â€œOh, cool, well, add it to their tab.â€
Like, I donâ€™t knowâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
They got a long tab running, you know. Also, they got divorced when I was 12, which is, like, the most â€œfuck youâ€ age you could possiblyâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Like, you guys werenâ€™t, like, killing it when I was five. You couldnâ€™t have done it then? You had to wait until I was 12? They did do the thing where theyâ€¦ This is a common thing I think parents do when they get divorced, they tell their kidsâ€¦ They told me, â€œItâ€™s not your fault. Donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s not your fault.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œYeah, first of all, I wasnâ€™t thinking that. Uhâ€¦ I donâ€™t know why you thought I thought it was on me. Have you seen you guys? Mom is cripplingly insecure, and Dadâ€™s addicted to prostitutes. On what fucking world is this on me?â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
I didnâ€™t have a good blueprintâ€¦ for what a relationship should look like, so, you know, Iâ€™ve struggled accordingly. Iâ€™ve had issues in relationships. Thereâ€™s other reasons for that, too. Like it canâ€™t be a good thingâ€¦ (CHUCKLES) It canâ€™t be a good thing that the firstâ€¦ 2,000â€¦ sexual experiences of my lifeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€¦were with a Dell computer. Like that canâ€™t beâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
It canâ€™t be helping. It canâ€™t be pushing me in the right direction on this pursuit of love and happiness that Iâ€™m on. Two thousand. Thatâ€™s the number, by the way. I didnâ€™t, like, write down a funny number for you. I counted.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Itâ€™s literally 2,000, age 12 to 19 was exclusively that every single day. I bought a computer for my family with my bar mitzvah money, and then I fucked it for seven years straight.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Thatâ€™s how I began. That is the origin story to my sexual identity, just downloading sexist shit into my head. Then waltzing out into the world like, â€œOh, yeah, I totally respect people.â€ How? How is that even possible? Itâ€™s so corrosive. That shit will rot your brain. And itâ€™s certainly, for a young boy, like, itâ€™s insane. Even now, itâ€™s likeâ€¦ We like to pretend like itâ€™s fine, but thatâ€™s only because we donâ€™t have to acknowledge what it is that weâ€™re doing. Itâ€™s like this virtual, wordless escapade. You never have to be accountable for what it is youâ€™re doing. I think beforeâ€¦ youâ€™re allowed to click on a videoâ€¦ you should have to say the title out loud.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
How badly do you want this? I feel like most people are like, â€œIâ€™m just gonna call my mom and reconnectâ€¦ the person I need to be.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
And itâ€™s bled in. Yeah, my relationship dynamics have always been somewhat turbulent. A lot of back and forth, break up, get back together kind of things. A lot of things that start really quickly. Itâ€™s like immediate intensity, you know? Because usually I feel like shit about myself and they feel like shit about themselves, and we come together and weâ€™re like, â€œWell, we have each other. And we can do all this stuff! We can do all this stuff together now that weâ€™re both here. We can rub each otherâ€™s heads. We can take naps together. We can, like, slow dance in the kitchen while weâ€™re waiting for our cookies to finish baking.â€ How specific do you want me to get?
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
But then when I have all that stuff, Iâ€™m able to see, Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, this is a very codependent relationship, this isnâ€™t healthy. This isnâ€™t the kind of thing I wanna be in long term. Youâ€™re not the person thatâ€™s right for me.â€ So Iâ€™ll be like, â€œMaybe we should break up.â€ But then they leave, they take all the stuff! Iâ€™m like, â€œI wanna break up with you, but you should love me still. Like, you should still give me all the things, just donâ€™t ask me for anything.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Like, â€œI need you. Like, this is all built off of the back of you. Like, your love for me gave me the confidence to even feel like I could break up with you.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI never wouldâ€™ve broken up with you if I was by myself.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But itâ€™s a self-esteem thing. I donâ€™t feelâ€¦ I donâ€™t feel, like, good enough for the person that Iâ€¦ that would be right for me, you know? So, what ifâ€¦ I play this in my head. What it feels like I need to do is I need to find a girlfriend, uh, in order to be confident enough to be the type of person that I would need to be in order to attract the girl that I actually want to be with.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
On my own, Iâ€™m nothing, but in a relationship, Iâ€™m kind of a catch.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES) I feel like this is a common phenomenon, that love at first sight, that idea, it gets propagated. We all know what you mean by it, â€œlove at first sight.â€ And itâ€™s something thatâ€™s a really enchanting idea, you know? â€˜Cause youâ€™re like, you know, one minute youâ€™re alone, the next minute youâ€™ve found the one. Itâ€™s like, â€œWhat aâ€¦ What a day.â€ (CHUCKLES)
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
What a day that would be. And so itâ€™s so enticing, but Iâ€™ve seenâ€¦ Iâ€™ve gone that route so many times, I know whatâ€™s on the back end of it, so itâ€™s hard for me not to be cynical about it. Now when I hear people like, â€œWe knew right awayâ€¦â€ Did you? â€˜Cause now anytime I hear someone say about their own relationship, â€œWe knew right away,â€ all I hear is, â€œWe were both abandoned as children.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
You knew right away? Your threshold for loving a person is you saw them once? That seems like a low bar to clear.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
I feel like maybe you canâ€™t handle the anxiety of uncertainty, so you went from zero to 100 right away to skip over that prospect of rejection and the risk that they might not be who you imagine them to be. Am I close? Am I fucking close? -Like, I feel like thatâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€¦is a more accurate characterization of what weâ€™re talking about. If youâ€™re drawn to somebody that quickly, that strongly, that intensely, that immediately, thatâ€™s not love. You probably have unresolved trauma.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
And the other person probably represents an embodiment of the trigger of that trauma, so youâ€™re drawn to them in this misguided attempt to retroactively fix a fucked-up period in your past. Thatâ€™s not love! Donâ€™t call that love. Donâ€™t rebrand that as love and make the rest of us feel bad. Donâ€™t be out in the world like, â€œIt was love at first sight.â€ Say something honest like, â€œIt was â€˜I felt the way I did when my dad leftâ€™ at first sight.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Iâ€™ll believe that. Iâ€™ll believe that, yeah. â€œMy husbandâ€™s face looks just like the back of my fatherâ€™s head, so I chased itâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦to now.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
You should not be chasing. Donâ€™t chase. Love should not be chased. (GASPS) You shouldnâ€™t have that, like, â€œAre we gonna make it?â€ (CHUCKLES) No!
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
If youâ€™re wondering, no. You should not be chasing. Like in movies, like, to propagate this idea, â€œchase them,â€ and that rom-com fantasy of chasing someone to an airport. Chase a therapist to an airport. Like, donâ€™tâ€¦ Like, â€œDonâ€™t leave, we have so much work to do!â€
Like, thatâ€™sâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
(CHUCKLES) No, â€™cause movies have to show youâ€¦ They canâ€™t show you what love actually is. We donâ€™t wanna see it. Love isnâ€™t entertaining. They have to show some dramatic, conflicted version of love. They donâ€™tâ€¦ We donâ€™t wanna see love, actual love. Itâ€™s beautiful. Iâ€™m not shitting on the sentiment. Itâ€™s an amazing thing between the two people. Itâ€™s not fun to watch. Think about a couple you know, maybe you are that couple, who are truly in love, in love, like, together, good, healthy. We donâ€™t wanna watch that. Like, if you wannaâ€¦
If youâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
If you watched a movie about a couple in love, you would just be on your couch watching a couple on their couch, watching a better movie.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Youâ€™re like, â€œWhyâ€¦ What are they watching? Iâ€™ll just watch that. Why donâ€™t we cut outâ€¦ cut out the middleman? I donâ€™t needâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God. Thatâ€™s not what they show you. â€˜Cause we donâ€™t wanna seeâ€¦ We donâ€™t wanna see healthy, good love. We wanna see, like, a manifestation of, like, our own internal dramas played outâ€¦ for entertainment value. The problem is there are people out there, like when I was a kid, who are like empty canvases, who internalized that. And so it starts to skew their view of what love could be. Like, people who donâ€™t have a healthy blueprint are gonna absorb that and take that in. You know, I was 12 years old when the movie Titanic came out, and that was, like, iconic love story. Like, here it is, epic love, cruelly interrupted by fate. And I look at that movie now, Iâ€™m like, â€œWait, what were we rooting for here? What did we want to happen? For them to get to New York? They werenâ€™t gonna make it as a couple.â€ What did we think? Theyâ€™re 20 years old, theyâ€™ve known each other two days. I donâ€™t know everything about relationships, but like, hey, maybe donâ€™t marry the artist you fucked on a cruise.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Maybe thatâ€™s not the move. Five minutes after you tried to kill yourself. Do you remember thatâ€™s how they met? She was trying to kill herself by jumping off the boat, and he was like, â€œHey, Iâ€™m pretty hot. What if you didnâ€™t do that?â€ And soâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Thatâ€™s how they started. They knew right away. Like, thatâ€™s the thing, is like, what happens? How is that gonna play out? Even if they get to New York, what? -They have nothing in common.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
You know what I mean? Like, all they have is the excitement that they made it. That lasts, what? Six months, a yearâ€¦ two years, maybe? What happens five, ten years down the road? Just sittinâ€™ there. Heâ€™s like, â€œSoâ€¦ you want me to draw you?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œFuck you!â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI was engaged to a billionaire. I had to sell that necklace to pay the heating bill. You havenâ€™t sold a sketch in years, Jack. Howâ€™s that art gallery going, Jack?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOh, come on. Remember when we danced -with the common folk?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Terrible. It wouldâ€™ve been terrible. People are like, â€œOh, itâ€™s so sad what happened. If they didnâ€™t hit the icebergâ€¦â€ Fuck that! The iceberg is the hero of that movie. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It mightâ€™ve killed Jack, but it saved the rest of Roseâ€™s life.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I like movies, I do. I do. I donâ€™t like movie culture, though, like Hollywoodâ€¦ like the culture surrounding it. And every time I get roped into watching an award show, Iâ€™m always reminded, like, who the fuck makes these things. Itâ€™s like, â€œOh, my God.â€ You ever watch an award show? Itâ€™s like this shouldnâ€™t be on television. This should be, likeâ€¦ like, in an underground cave at Bohemian Grove. Like, why is this in front of the public? â€˜Cause they try to act like theyâ€™re down-to-earth. Every time an actor wins an award, they always give someâ€¦ Itâ€™s not some, like, normal speech, itâ€™s like a lofty, sociopolitical response to the moment. Itâ€™s like, â€œWe need to find a way. Thereâ€™s a lot of problems in the world. We need to find a way to come together and not let it divide us.â€ Like Meryl Streep, â€œWe need to come together.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œFind unity and strength, and break down the barriers that keep us apart. -And find strength and unity.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œCome together as a globe, as a nation, as a people.â€ Iâ€™m always like, â€œYeah, uh, youâ€™re wearing a diamond dress from Givenchy.â€ Like, on what fucking planet are you part of â€œthe peopleâ€?
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Like, what do you think? Like, if there was a true peopleâ€™s revolution, like a peopleâ€™s uprising, itâ€™s gonna be your blood -splattered on the sidewalk.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Theyâ€™re not gonna spare you â€™cause they liked Devil Wears Prada. Theyâ€™re gonna rip your fucking head off, stick it on a stake, and sell that diamond dress to a cartel for machine guns.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Theyâ€™re not gonna be like, â€œOh, get in the bunker. We love the nuance of your artistic choices. It was so brave of you, how you dared, oh, how you dared to be a middle-class character.â€ Like, â€œOh, how you pretended to be a thing people are their entire lives. How did you do it? How did you prepare for the role?â€ And theyâ€™re always like, â€œOh, I lived amongst plumbers -for eight months.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI lived how they lived. I ate how they ate.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
No, thatâ€™s it, you canâ€™t. You canâ€™t preach togetherness and unity when youâ€™re that rich. You just canâ€™t do it. Youâ€™re rich. Youâ€™re super rich. Thatâ€™s why you got rich, is to get the fuck away from everybody.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Thatâ€™s what money is. Money is just an escape from people. Thatâ€™s why we want it. Everything money does for you. Doesnâ€™t even have to be a lot of money. Youâ€™d be like, â€œOoh, I can afford an Uber.â€ Whatâ€™s an Uber? That is a bus for one person.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Itâ€™s like, â€œYeah, I like the bus. I just wish there were no people on it and it only went where I want it to go.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Yeah, you can do that. You gotta pay for it. You wanna join a gym, thereâ€™s different kinds of gyms, right? Thereâ€™s a whole spectrum of gym options. Thereâ€™s a ten-dollar-a-month gym on one end. Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym on the other end. Whatâ€™s the difference? Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym, itâ€™s nicer. Itâ€™s not 20 times nicer. Itâ€™s not like the ten-dollar-a-month gym, the walls are falling off, and you pick up the ten-pound weight and itâ€™s 100 pounds. Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, fuck this gym! The dumbbells are Gatorade bottles filled with rocks, this gym sucks.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
No, thereâ€™s still equipment there. The 200-dollar-a-month gym, you pay 200 dollars a month so you donâ€™t have to look at people who can only afford ten dollars a month.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re paying for. You wanna be able to do a pull-up without being reminded of the dark underbelly of capitalism.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Itâ€™s a 190-dollar surcharge to not have to make eye contact with the consolation prize in this fucked-up game weâ€™re all playing here. Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re paying for. Thatâ€™s the premium. Everything money does for you just pushes you further and further away from everybody else. You wanna fly, you buy a plane ticket. First-class ticket, way more expensive. Why? Thereâ€™s less people up there. They wonâ€™t tell you that. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œNo, you get more space.â€ Itâ€™s like, yeah, motherfucker, space is just the absence of people.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Itâ€™s not a new entity. Space is a euphemism for not anybody. â€œNo, you get all this legroom.â€ Yeah, â€™cause theyâ€™re no people in the way of where my legs are trying to go. We could all have legroom back here if we werenâ€™t all back here.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Now, could you imagine if two people in economy class were, like, fighting over the armrest, and some asshole from first class came back and was like, â€œHey! We need to all work together. We need to find unity and strength as a flight. Weâ€™re all flight 348, after all.â€ Then they swoosh the curtain and go back to their apartment in the sky. How quickly before the back rows start bundling their plastic silverware together to storm the front?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Like, â€œNo, no, weâ€™re not trying to hijack the plane, weâ€™re just trying to kill rows one through five. Take their hot towels and orange juice and spread it around.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Thatâ€™s the fantasy. Everyone fantasizes about what they would do when they get rich. You wanna get away from everybody. Nobody fantasizes about togetherness. Nobodyâ€™s like, â€œOh, dude, if I got richâ€¦ (CHUCKLES) I would get so many roommates.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œOh, itâ€™d be sick, weâ€™d have like a dishes schedule.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
No, the fantasy is, â€œIâ€™m gonna build a moat around my house. People arenâ€™t gonna be able to ring my doorbell without swimming across a crocodile-laden river.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Fuck everybody. And I got nothing against rich people. You just canâ€™t have it both ways. You canâ€™t bridge class with a speech. You canâ€™t have it all and then have this, like, faux empathy. Like, â€œAwwâ€¦ itâ€™s so sad, people donâ€™t have any money.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œWell, you seem to have it.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œTry giving it away. You donâ€™t have to have it.â€ And these phony causes, every Thanksgiving, one of them comes out with, like, â€œItâ€™s so terrible what happened to the Native Americans.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œFucking, I donâ€™t know, give â€™em the land back.â€
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) â€œNo.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWe canâ€™t do that. Where would we put the offices of DoorDash?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES) I swear to God, these fuckingâ€¦ Like North America could be, like, falling into the ocean. We could all be killing each other over grain seeds and fresh water. These people would be like on Mars, -tweeting, â€œStop the violence.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œLove is stronger than hate.â€ And changing their profile picture to a blue circle to show they still care about Earth.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Going on Jimmy Fallon to promote it, like, â€œYeah, weâ€™re changing our profile pictures to blue circles to raise Earth awareness.â€ Jimmyâ€™s just like, â€œOh, my God, itâ€™s genius. Such a good idea.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œOh, my God, howâ€™d you think of it? Itâ€™s so important. Youâ€™re doing such important work.â€ (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œOh, my God, itâ€™sâ€¦â€ (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Jimmy Fallon. Iâ€™m sorry, is there a more Guy Smiley, useless, puppet fuck of a personâ€¦
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)
â€¦than Jimmy Fallon? Professional napkin. Like how the fuck?
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
(GIGGLES SARCASTICALLY) Dude, I used to think Leno said nothing. Fallon makes Leno look like Malcolm X.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Like, â€œOh, yeah.â€ (BABBLES INCOMPREHENSIBLY) Iâ€™ll never get asked to do the show, butâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLES) Iâ€¦ I would wanna do it just one time, just to be like, â€œHey, Jimmy, what do you not like?â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œWhatâ€¦ Is there anythingâ€¦ Do you have a hard stance on fucking anything?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Heâ€™d be like, â€œOh, my God, itâ€™s such a cool take.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(GIGGLES) â€œI donâ€™t know, Iâ€¦ I just kinda float around. I have no discretion, yet Iâ€™m hugely influential. Cultureâ€™s a joke.â€ (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œEvery time I speak, I mean less to myself. Iâ€™m murdering my identity up here.â€ (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) â€œItâ€™s genius.â€ (LAUGHS) Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Like you could literallyâ€¦ You could put a gun in his mouth andâ€¦ (MIMICS GUNSHOT) â€¦blow his head off and heâ€™d be like, â€œOh, my God, my brains are on the wall! Itâ€™s so cool!â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œHowâ€™d you do that?â€ Heâ€™s a horror movie villain. You canâ€™t kill him. His weapon is just effusive nothingness. He just keeps coming. (SCREECHES) â€œCome back! Donâ€™t you wanna play truth or dare with Ariana Grande?â€ (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING)
Nice. (SIGHS) Look, I just think if entertainment is gonna be this ubiquitous, it canâ€™t be this devoid of humanity. It just canâ€™t. Itâ€¦ You know, â€™cause I grew up, entertainment was important to me. And so, you know, I looked to it for something, and to be that devoid of substance, it feelsâ€¦ insulting. The problem with entertainment is that itâ€™s all madeâ€¦ by the same type of person. Itâ€™s made by entertainers. Right? So itâ€™s likeâ€¦
Entertainers are psychotic.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Like, just statistically. So, look at this room right now. Almost everybody in the room is sitting nicely, looking at this, and only one person is like, â€œHeh, heh, my thoughts.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œMy thoughts.â€ And after this is over, youâ€™ll go home to your respectable lives. And Iâ€™ll try to find another place to do, â€œMy thoughts.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œSoon Iâ€™ll be full.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
So you have to consider the source, right? I think about that with all media. Social media, for example, like, you knowâ€¦ You look at like Twitter or something like that, itâ€™s likeâ€¦ Like Twitterâ€¦ Whoâ€™s on Twitter? Itâ€™s justâ€¦ Itâ€™s only people who think itâ€™s like a good idea -to be on Twitter. Likeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Itâ€™s not everybody. It pretends to be everybody, like, â€œOoh, everyoneâ€™s mad.â€ You look at the trending topics, â€œOoh, whatâ€™s everyone talking about?â€ Itâ€™s not. Most people arenâ€™t on it. Eighty percent of the public doesnâ€™t use it. Ninety percent, I think, doesnâ€™t use it regularly. So, like, whatâ€™s trending? Likeâ€¦ Most people arenâ€™t there, so whatâ€™s really trending is shutting the fuck up. Like, most peopleâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Most people are doing that, but you canâ€™t register that. You canâ€™t show somebody not tweeting. Like you canâ€™tâ€¦ They should show how much we donâ€™t tweet also. They should show like a tweet, and then you scroll through blank space for like seven hours.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And then you come across another tweet. Youâ€™d be like, â€œThis is a barren wasteland for lunatics.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Everyone on Twitter is somebody on Twitter. Thereâ€™s an inherent insanity in the medium. Right? Itâ€™s the same reason I canâ€™t trust Yelp.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Every time I look at Yelp, I read a Yelp review, Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, but this person wrote a Yelp review.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhy am I listening to a person who logged in to write three paragraphs on broccoli rabe?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Everyone on Yelp is someone on Yelâ€¦ Every Yelp review starts with someone going, â€œIâ€™m gonna write a Yelp review.â€ Like, fuck whoever that person is. But thatâ€™s everyone on Yelp. Everyone on Yelp is someone who uses Yelp. Everyone on Twitter is someone who uses Twitter. I want a social media site where the only way to use it is to not. Like, I donâ€™t wanna hear the thoughts that you want me to think that you think. I wanna hear what you think. I wanna hear what you donâ€™t even let yourself think you think. You know those thoughts? You ever have like a fucking crazy thought that bubbles up, and you push it away, youâ€™re like, â€œDidnâ€™t think it! Didnâ€™t think it. Still a good person. Didnâ€™tâ€¦ â€˜Cause I didnâ€™t think it all the way. I didnâ€™t finish the thought that I clearly started, so somehow thatâ€™s not me.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
I want those. I want you to cut open your heart and dump it into my brain. Intimacy is what Iâ€™m looking for. Which is notâ€¦ I shouldnâ€™t go to social media for intimacy, you canâ€™t get it. You ever see someone try to be intimate on social media? -Itâ€™s fucking terrible.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
It doesnâ€™t work. It never works, â€™cause it doesnâ€™t have the language for intimacy. â€˜Cause intimacy is amorphous. It doesnâ€™t come with a character limit, or a soundtrack, or filter, itâ€™s justâ€¦ (GRUNTS) The language of social media, is like, snark and division and attacks and clapbacks and, â€œOh, that? Oh, clearly you donâ€™t even know about this.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
That rises. That gets a lot of attention. But weâ€™re all, like, fucked up, right? Itâ€™s like very confusing, and thereâ€™s a big market right now for certainty. Anyone who has an answer, even if itâ€™s the wrong one, is in demand. Thatâ€™s why you get this whole rash of people who garner these followings, â€™cause theyâ€™re giving people a narrative. All these like, you know, podcast hosts, demagogue type, usually a white dude whoâ€™s like, â€œHey, the media and the government are all lying to you, but you know whoâ€™s not?â€ (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) â€œMe!â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œMe, the guy trying to sell you CBD oil and sex toys every 30 minutes. Iâ€™m your beacon of truth. Wear me, listen to me.â€ This is collective narcissism. Itâ€™s changed the way we think, like the way we process our own language, like how we sound. I remember in the â€™16 election, they were talking about the Rock maybe running for president, and I said that to a friend, I was like, â€œYo, I heard the Rock might run for president.â€ My buddy was like, â€œIs the Rock a Democrat?â€ And I was like, â€œDude, listen to the sentenceâ€¦â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œâ€¦that you just said. Is the Rock a Democrat? I donâ€™t know. Heâ€™s a fake wrestling character. I donâ€™t know where he stands on healthcare.â€ Is the Rock a Democrat? I donâ€™t know. Did the Yellow Power Ranger support the war in Iraq? What the fuck are we talking about?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Where does Mickey Mouse stand on abortion? I donâ€™t know. Is he a â€œsecond trimester or beforeâ€ kind of mouse, or more like a hardlineâ€¦ (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) â€œLife begins at conception, folks.â€ Like, I donâ€™t know what Mickey thinks. Does Mickey think, or does he just do whatever the artist makes him do? Is there a consciousness in Mickey? Do any of us think, or are we just being guided by an unseen hand? Is thinking part of the illusion? Is Descartes a fraud? This is why I had to get off of Twitter. I existentially spiral. I lose who I am. I did, I deleted my Twitter a year ago. I still have Instagram because Iâ€™m stupid.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Instagram isâ€¦ Itâ€™s like hell. Itâ€™s just like hell. You can download hell to your phone for free.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Itâ€™s free. Hell is free. Instagram is just like, â€œHeyâ€¦ uh, are you not feeling jealous today?â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œCome hang out. Look, thereâ€™s a beer, some food youâ€™ll never eat. Go fuck yourself. We hate you. We are trying to tear you down. We donâ€™t give a fuck. Hereâ€™s places youâ€™ll never go. Hereâ€™s a person that will never fuck you. Go fuck yourself. We hate you.â€ â€œWe are manipulating your emotions, and then monitoring them so we can sell you shit. You want a bracelet? Yeah, we knew you would, motherfucker.â€ Literally. Literally! Literally. People are like, â€œWhat do those bracelets mean?â€ They mean Iâ€™m a fucking moron!
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
They mean I was depressed and got a targeted ad and thought these bracelets would turn it all around.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Thatâ€™s what they mean. â€œYou are nothing. We have hollowed you out and emptied you and filled you with ourselves and the desire for more. You are powerless against it. This is a takeover. Didnâ€™t happen the way it did in Terminator. Itâ€™s a lot more subtle, with more cat videos and 14-year-olds twerking. Is that a crime? Ha, ha. Weâ€™ll never tell you.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I hate it. It makes me feel like shit. The only social media site that I likeâ€¦ is, uh, Venmo.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
Thatâ€™s right. I like Venmo. Venmoâ€™s a money transfer app, which everybody knows. But what not everybody knows is that on Venmo, thereâ€™s a feed, where you can likeâ€¦ tab over and you can see all of your friendsâ€™ and your contactsâ€™ financial transactions, which should be illegal, but itâ€™s there.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Itâ€™s right there. And I like it because itâ€™s honest. Itâ€™s the only honest social media site out there. Every other social media site is a projection of a version of yourself that you wish you were onto a canvas. Not Venmo. Venmo is the honest antidote to the horseshit of Instagram. Instagram makes you feel bad because youâ€™re aware of your own fears and insecurities and preoccupations, but youâ€™re not seeing anybody elseâ€™s. So youâ€™re always gonna lean that way. So you see a picture on Instagram of, like, a coupleâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Maybe theyâ€™re on, like, a beachâ€¦ looking at a gorgeous sunset. Maybe theyâ€™re eating a pizza.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
You look at this, youâ€™re like, â€œWhat the fuck? What the fuck? The fuck is wrong with me? How come Iâ€™m not doing that shit, huh? Is there something wrong with me? Is there a hole here that everybody can see? Do I emanate darkness, do I repel love? Is there a limit to my emotional aptitude? Did my fatherâ€™s genetics set that limit? Do I need to go back on antidepressants? What the fuck is going on inside of me thatâ€™s not leading me to that type of bliss? What do I have to do to get there?â€ But then you look at Venmo and itâ€™s like, â€œOh, no, dude, they split that pizza.â€
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(APPLAUSE)
â€œIâ€™m doing just fine.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œI donâ€™t need medication.â€ (CHUCKLES) Itâ€™s not a referendum on splitting stuff in a relationship. I think if youâ€™re gonna split stuff, just donâ€™t split the items. Go every other. Does that make sense? Iâ€™ll see that on Venmo. I go on Venmo, Iâ€™ll see, â€œBoyfriend sends girlfriend money for tacos.â€ Iâ€™m just, like, how the fuck do you go down on someone after you just sent them eight bucks?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(SCOFFS) â€œYouâ€™re just bitter, Drew, that you have no one to split stuff with.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Yeah, Iâ€™m single. Iâ€™m 36â€¦ and single. Iâ€™m single and 36, which is fine. Uh, but it is almost not.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Like, itâ€™s not bad yet, but bad is next.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Bad is the next stop on thisâ€¦ train. A lot of my friends are married. And itâ€™s cool to see. A lot of them are in, like, really great relationships, really healthy, good, loving relationships. And itâ€™s really amazing to see. I go to their weddings, I really enjoy it. Seeing them come together, itâ€™s a beautiful thing. And I hear a lot of the same things in the vows. Thereâ€™s a common refrain in the vows, which is something about, like, you know, â€œI get to marry my best friend.â€ â€œIâ€™m so lucky to have found my best friend.â€ â€œI never thought I would spend the rest of my life with my best friend.â€ And I hear that, Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s such a beautiful sentiment.â€ Like, the person you marry should feelâ€¦ like your best friend. Iâ€™m in the back, Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, Iâ€™m 36, so who the fuck meets their best friend in their late thirties?â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Whoâ€™s out there like, â€œThis is my best friend! We met when were 38!â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œTell him, Doug!â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
No, it doesnâ€™t happen. Theyâ€™re all having kids, too, starting families. My friends starting families, itâ€™s beautiful to see. I donâ€™t have my own family. I have, like, a family from which Iâ€™ve come. I donâ€™t haveâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€¦the next line on that. Like on a family tree, Iâ€™m just a node that ends.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Itâ€™s just like, â€œWhoâ€™s that?â€ â€œThatâ€™s your great Uncle Drew, nobody loved him.â€ (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Just a leaf on a twig. Just a Styrofoam ball with no toothpicks, if weâ€™re using school project lingo.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œOh, cool, you got me a PlayStation for my birthday. I love you, Dad.â€ I just beat God of War for the fourth time.
(AUDIENCE MEMBER CHEERING)
Itâ€™s a good game.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Itâ€™s not â€œhugging my smiling childâ€ good.
(AUDIENCE LAUGH)
But the gameplay mechanics are pretty tight.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
I think part of the reason I donâ€™tâ€¦ have a family, well, at least what I used to tell myself, is that I do this. Itâ€™s something that I chose. I chose a different path. I remember I started doing stand-up when I was 22. I dropped out of school, andâ€¦ at the time, my mother warned me. She said, â€œYou know, itâ€™s not very stable. Youâ€™re gonna be living hand-to-mouth, traveling a lot. Youâ€™re not gonna be able to settle down.â€ And she was right to an extent. But the problem was, she was telling this to a 22-year-old dude. Like the least likely candidate on Earth to settle down. I donâ€™t know if you know any 22-year-old dudes, but theyâ€™re not technically people.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Just unprocessed pain and skin. Like, thatâ€™s pretty much the identity there. So, 22, Iâ€™m hearing this, Iâ€™m like, â€œSettle down? What are you, a hundred? I donâ€™t give a fuck. Iâ€™m going on the road, Mom. Iâ€™ma follow my dreams! Nobody is gonna stop me!â€ That was my attitude. Now Iâ€™m 36. Now I see the punchline. Now itâ€™s likeâ€¦ (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) â€œNobody is going to hug me as I die.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Is that funny? I donâ€™t know. I structured it as a joke. Does that make it funny? I donâ€™t know. Does comedy have the ability to transform the emotional constitution of reality, or is it just adding a layer to an unfortunate event? I donâ€™t know how the physics of comedy work. I used to tell myself that it was a sacrifice I was making. I was leaving that on the side to pursue this. And I used to lookâ€¦ It was very easy to make that argument, â€™cause I used to look around and there were a lot of men who accomplished things that I considered to be great, whose personal life was kind of left by the wayside. And so it seemed to me as a necessary component. I remember in high school I learned about Isaac Newton. And Isaac Newton invented calculus. He also died a virgin.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Which begs the question, can you invent calculus while fucking people?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s never been done.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
A more modern example, Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was an incredible innovatorâ€¦ uh, terrible fatherâ€¦ right, which we know, itâ€™s documented, but we also just knew.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
We knew. Every time weâ€™d go into our pocket, if Steve Jobs were a good dad, weâ€™d pull out a Samsung or a Motorola.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Every time you text someone and it shows up blue, thatâ€™s Steve Jobs not going to a piano recital -or a softball game.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And I donâ€™t think we have the right to judge him. Like, we are all glad he did it. Like, we encouraged that. As a society, we would all rather one girl grow up with a shitty dad than have to all of us use Windows. Are you out of your fucking mind? You want us all to click a Start button and run clunky .exe files just so one girl can open her gifts next to the guy who paid for them? Fuck that! She can get them from a nanny while the rest of us enjoy ourâ€¦ technological ecosystem seamlessly integrated.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Thatâ€™s what we encourage. We encourage it. True happiness has no societal value. We want productivity. Give usâ€¦ Make something or shut up! Like, we donâ€™t care. So thereâ€™s this incentive to do it. And it gets even more fucked up. Someone like Michael Jackson, who was this incredible popstar and a horrendous babysitter, you know, where itâ€™s just likeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Yeah, itâ€™s an easy one, but itâ€™s fun. Itâ€™s fun, though. Itâ€™s so easy, but itâ€™s so fun.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
No, but even that, like thereâ€™s such an instinct to defend these guys. Like my first instinct is to be likeâ€¦ see it from their side, because I think weâ€™re suchâ€¦ weâ€™re conditioned to like them on that level. So even with Michael, I was likeâ€¦ you know, there was a part of meâ€¦ I watched that documentary about him, I was like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s fucked up.â€ But there was a part of me that was like, â€œYeah, but if not an eight-year-old boy, who was Michael Jackson supposed to date?â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
You know what I mean? What is he looking at, options-wise, that makes any sense at all? Somebody his age? He did that. He was married to Lisa Marie Presley, a grown woman, and that was weirder somehow.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
That was weirder. They made out on television. It was fucking weird. There was like an awards show presentation and at the end, they like did this kiss, it was just awful. Like, â€œOh!â€ The whole world was just like, â€œOh, my God.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œJesus, will somebody get this guy a kid?â€ -Like, â€œThis is horrible.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Because Michael Jackson with a kid, it upsets us morally, but it looks right.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Michael canâ€™t date an adult. You wouldnâ€™t set your friend up with him. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) Whoâ€™s he supposed toâ€¦ What is he gonna do, go on like a blind date with a 35-year-old software developer? Howâ€™s that gonna go? â€œHey, nice to meet you, Michael.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou wanna play tag? Youâ€™re it.â€ Like, come on.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhere are yourâ€¦â€ â€œTag? I thought weâ€™d go to dinner.â€ â€œDinnerâ€™s for dumb-dumbs. We can eat candy at my house and stay up as late as we want. Tee-hee!â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Michael canâ€™t date an adult. I donâ€™t even know what kind of adult would be into Michael. Like you wannaâ€¦ you wanna fuck him? Listen to him sure, but, like, you wannaâ€¦
(IMITATES MICHAEL JACKSON) You wanna fuck that guy?
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
You wanna fuck him? â€œHere, doo-doo head.â€ Youâ€™re gonna fuck him? Dude, if youâ€™re an adult and you wanna fuck Michael Jacksonâ€¦ youâ€™re a pedophile.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
But you look at all these guys, you know, Michael Jackson, Isaac Newton, Steve Jobs, they were adored by the world but hated by the people closest to them. And I would imagine that youâ€™d tell yourself that thatâ€™s a sacrificeâ€¦ that you make, butâ€¦ as I get older, I look at it differently. I donâ€™t know if I look at it as a sacrifice anymore. Maybeâ€¦ maybe not. Maybeâ€¦ they just ran from responsibility into the arms of ambition. You know, maybe Apple and Pixarâ€¦ are just built off the back of one manâ€™s inability to be intimate with the people closest to him. Or with himself. And so it recasts my own path, where Iâ€™m like, maybe this isnâ€™t a sacrifice. Iâ€™m not comparing myself toâ€¦ Steve Jobs andâ€¦ Isaac Newton, you know. Itâ€™s a matter of scale.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
But even in the comedy world, even the people that I looked up toâ€¦ When I started, all the people that I looked up to, theyâ€™re all either, like, prematurely dead, utterly miserable, or, like, sex criminals. Soâ€¦ where is this headed?
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Where is this path going? Their greatness is predicated on their accomplishments, but we fail to recognize how they failed in their private moments. And I think thatâ€™s a masculine definition of greatness. Because, like, I donâ€™t look at that as great anymore because they couldnâ€™t confront who they were as a person. They couldnâ€™t confront the emotional reality of their experience. That is greatness to me. To do that, that is a much greater thing. How great can something be if itâ€™s built on avoidance? I think you have toâ€¦ confront. And itâ€™s scary. Itâ€™s a scary fucking thing to do. Like, I get it. Itâ€™s like totally scary for a lot of reasons. One, you can find out that the story youâ€™ve been telling yourself about yourself isnâ€™t true. You can find out that what you thought was like the harsh, brutal reality of yourself, youâ€™re just resting on an easier narrative that could be subverted by something else. Like I used to tell myself stories about myself that have shifted over time. I used to tell myself this was a sacrifice. I used to tell myself that what I was doing up here was important, that it was fearless. That I was fearless for doing this. I had the balls to say shit that nobody else did. Things like that Michael Jackson joke, Iâ€™d be like, â€œThatâ€™s fearless. Thatâ€™s a fearless fucking thing. You can get mad at me. Thatâ€™s fearless. Iâ€™m willing to stand that down.â€ But as I get older, Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s notâ€¦ I think itâ€™s funny, but itâ€™s not fearless.â€ Because my emotional experience is nowhere in there. Iâ€™m nowhere in that joke. I wasnâ€™t molested, and Iâ€™m not a pedophile.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
That would be fearless.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The most fearless pedophile joke you could tell is to be one and admit it publicly.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
No, worst-case scenario, worst-case scenario, the joke bombs and you donâ€™t like it. You look at me, arms folded, shaking your head and say, â€œNo.â€ Fortunately, that didnâ€™t happen this evening, but it has happened. It could happen. You can get mad. You could think I suck. You could not like me. But, counterpointâ€¦ who are you?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I can barely see any of you, and I love none of you. So what is this powerâ€¦ that you hold over me? Youâ€™re not me. We are always our most terrifying audience. I believe that. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so funny when people say that, like, public speaking is the number one fear of people. They say, you hear that, â€œPublic speaking is the number one fear of people.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œWell, Iâ€™m sorry, was confronting yourself on an emotional level not on that questionnaire?â€ The fuck you talking about, public speaking? Iâ€™m public speaking right now. Itâ€™s fine. Iâ€™m public speaking as a way to avoid confronting myself on an emotional level.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
This is all. Like, up here itâ€™s, like, â€œDopamine!â€ And if I were at home, itâ€™d be likeâ€¦ (SCREECHES) (SCREECHES) I have used this to avoid so manyâ€¦ I canâ€™t tell you how many relationships Iâ€™ve been in where Iâ€™ve been like, â€œOh, sorry, I canâ€™t hang out with you tonight. I have to go do a show.â€ Or more specifically, â€œSorry, I canâ€™t be there on your birthday. I need to go do this bit about how all my relationships fall apart.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Itâ€™s like just, â€œDo I need any of this?â€ And I think as men, we have this tendency to wanna process everything in our lives through, you know, intellect, or logic, or our thoughts, or our reason, things that we do, things that are tactile, and itâ€™s likeâ€¦ youâ€™re ignoring the entire emotional subset of your experience. And this idea that logic and emotions are separate, theyâ€™re not. Like your thoughts are not separate from how you feel. Your thoughtsâ€¦ Thoughts are just emotions in drag.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Itâ€™s the same ecosystem. Itâ€™s hard to dive inâ€¦ like that. Therapyâ€™s a good way to do it. I think peopleâ€¦ a lot of people needâ€¦ Theyâ€™re menâ€¦ all men.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Yeah, Iâ€™m comfortable saying that. All men need to go to therapy forâ€¦ 20 years. Likeâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING)
Roughly. (CHUCKLES) Sometimes guys get mad. Theyâ€™re like, â€œFuck you, I donâ€™t need shit, you pandering pussy.â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œHey. You do.â€
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
â€œWhat was that?â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Women need therapy too. But usually when a woman goes to therapy, itâ€™s because a man in her life didnâ€™t.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
I started going four times a week. Itâ€™s a program, itâ€™s called psychoanalysis, and itâ€™s, uhâ€¦ The reason you go so often is so that you donâ€™t have time to close up. Like, if you go once a week, you have all week to just close back up, so you stay open throughout the week so you can access parts of yourself that are much harder to access normally. And so itâ€™s very emotional. Itâ€™s very exhausting. Itâ€™s very trying. I cry a lot. I sobâ€¦ The other day, I sobbed for, like, 20 minutes straight. And this is how fucked up I am. As soon as I collected myself, my first thought was, â€œThat shouldnâ€™t count toward my time.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING) But thatâ€™s me trying to get out of that moment. Like that moment was hard to swallow, and soâ€¦ joke, out, now weâ€™re out of it. But I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s how progress gets made. I think if you wanna make progress, you canâ€™t take that left turn at a punchline. You have to goâ€¦ You have to sit there and process it there. You have to go down. You have to take that Miss Frizzle Magic School Bus all the way. â€œWeâ€™re going to your emotional core!â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œLook out your left window. Is that Mom going on a date instead of hanging out with you? Yes, it is.â€
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€œProcess it! Feel it!â€ You have to stay there, and leave it there. You canâ€™t buy yourself out of the moment. Otherwise, the progress wonâ€™t get made. Itâ€™s very hard to do. And Iâ€™m up here and I, like, I want to bring you in. Like, thatâ€™s where this is going. Like I wantâ€¦ Thatâ€™s the next step, is I want to bring you all to that place. But itâ€™s hard because, like, I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s a show down there. But I wanna bring you in, but I feel conflicted. I feel like I canâ€™tâ€¦ I have to likeâ€¦ I feel like thatâ€™s how this works, is I go in, I mine my own life for sadness, and then I contort it into a balloon animal for you so you donâ€™t feel ripped off.
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
I triedâ€¦ to do that. I wroteâ€¦ I wrote a jokeâ€¦ that tries to do that.
Why did the chickenâ€¦
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
â€¦cross the road?
AUDIENCE: Why?
Becauseâ€¦ he grew upâ€¦ with an untreated hearing lossâ€¦ which deprived him of a major sensory connection to the people around him, and it isolated him to the point of chronic torture. And his parents were too caught up in their own drama and insecurities to attend to it, so he processed it as though there was something inherently wrong with him. And his feelings are a threat to his relationships, so he just suffered in silence, feeling like he was 100 feet underwater, wondering why nobody was coming to save him. And then, he finally started wearing hearing aids, which created this insane sensation of being able to participate in a world that he didnâ€™t understand. But because his self-worth was predicated on how special he felt, he realized that the trodden path didnâ€™t appeal to him. So he would get high and watch stand-up comedy as a way to numb the agony of how lost he felt. And in doing so, he found a lot of connection with their points of view, and he thought, â€œWow, if I could do that, people could connect to me like that.â€ So he decided to drop out of school and pursue stand-up comedy, and doing comedy made him feel better for a moment, but it never forced him to address any of the reasons he actually felt like shit. He so badly wanted to feel special and powerful to make up for how worthless he felt, so he would say all sorts of fucked-up things, onstage and off, as a way to separate himself. And a lot of it he stands by, but there are a lot of things he said that were flagrant and unnecessary and hurtful and racist and sexist and homophobic, all of which he justified under the guise of pushing the envelope, which he thought was an act of justified rebellion against some arbitrary authority. But too late, he learned that a lot of those boundaries are derived from real peopleâ€™s feelings and experiences and he was essentially exploiting their actual pain and using it as a traffic cone to satisfy this story he was telling himself where he was a genius. And just because people laugh at something doesnâ€™t inherently make it good. They could be just as emotionally immature or ignorant as the perspective in the joke, or they could be responding to joke structure and timing more than content. And then, one dayâ€¦
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)
â€¦all the worldâ€™s stages boarded up, so he sat alone in a room for a year, and he did nothing but talk to the walls and a therapist. And with no emotion to escape into, he slowly started breaking down the paradigm heâ€™d constructed and moved into the feelings he was running from. And he discovered how badly he had been hurting his entire life, and what it actually is to hurt so badly. And he realized that there was not a single period of his life in which he was truly happy. And through that, he started to realize how much pain he had caused other people. He instantly regretted all the ways in which heâ€™s needlessly made people feel like shit in order to protect his own conception of himself as strong. Then he wanted to disappear from the world entirely because he felt like such an incredibly bad person for having done these things. So his instinct was to beat himself up about it and tell himself what a horrible person he is, but heâ€™s been shaming himself his entire life, and all these things he did were just ways to push people away and deprive himself of any meaningful connection, because of how badly he felt about himself, because it was too scary and painful to be open enough to connect to anyone else. So, while he hurt people, he was hurting no one more than himself, and he doesnâ€™t want to do that anymore. He has worked so hard to clear out space within himself and feel safer in his own body and treat himself like a friend he loves as opposed to an enemy he hates, which means he no longer tolerates dynamics based on his own self-destruction, which has changed numerous relationships in his life, including the one with the art form that he loves. The fear has always been that if he makes peace with the subterranean feelings that drive all of this, heâ€™d lose this piece of himself which has helped him survive and get to this point, a fear that he wonâ€™t be funny anymore, he wonâ€™t be special, heâ€™ll just be, which has been an intolerable notion because he doesnâ€™t feel like enough on his own. Heâ€™s only known how to exist by chasing, or thinking, or running, or fighting, or straining, or suffering, or striving, or analyzing, anxious energy which ultimately manifests the very same emptiness itâ€™s borne out of. And it keeps him locked into one side of himself, but heâ€™s making every effort to find a way to not give in to those anxieties and sit with the quiet inside of himself because he wants so badly to get to the other side.

Ladies and gentleman.
[cheering]
You can feel excitement in the air. Here we go, Houston, Texas! [cheering] Letâ€™s get this show on the road. Dwayne Johnson here, also known as The Rock, also known as La Roca in Spanish, also known as the sexiest motherfucker alive. Itâ€™s not important right now, but what is important that you guys have come together to see one man. The man who hails from a place that many of you know. The Alief area.
[cheering]
Yes. [chuckles] â€œThe SWATâ€ as we call it. Many amazing people have come out of the Swat. Lizzo, BeyoncÃ©, Travis Scott. [cheering] And one other person, who you guys did not know has come out of the Swat, is the one and only peopleâ€™s champ, The Rock! [cheering] Well, just for tonight, Iâ€™ve come out of the Swat. But tomorrow Iâ€™ll be from some place else. Probably Hawaii. Listen, what is important right now, [chuckles] is that I have the honor of introducing the man who you have come to see. Ladies and gentlemen of Houston, a warm hometown Houston welcome for the man himself. [whistling] The other peopleâ€™s champion. My boy. Your boy. Mo Amer.
[cheering]
[deep base music drops]
[cool slowbeats music playing]
[cheering and whistling]
Whatâ€™s up, Houston? All right, all right, all right, all right. Take a seat. Take a seat. Take a seat. We made it! We made it. [music fades out] We made it, yâ€™all. For real, like, itâ€™s so amazing. Weâ€™re all here together. I mean, after the last 19 months that weâ€™ve had. I mean, weâ€™re here. Weâ€™re together. As a live performer I thought it was over, to be honest. [laughing] And now weâ€™re here. That was the second time I ever thought my career potentially might be over. The first timeâ€¦ [laughing] was right after 9/11.
[laughing and applause]
Someone named Mohammed. I was like, â€œItâ€™s not looking good for me out here.â€ [laughing] [Mo chuckles] Matter of fact, my own family turned on me. [laughing] My own brother looked me dead in my eyes and goes, â€œYour career is over.â€ [laughing] I was like, â€œHow could you say some shit like that to me?â€ â€œYou know I always wanted to be a stand up comedian.â€ He goes, â€œLook how theyâ€™re talking about us on the news.â€ â€œNobody wants to see a Mohammed on stage telling jokes.â€ â€œYour career is over.â€ I said, â€œOmar, youâ€™re a pilot.â€
[laughing and applause]
Now Iâ€™m in a movie with The Rock. In your face, bitch. You know what I mean? [chuckles]
[cheering and applause]
Wow. Is it over though? [sighs] Is the pandemic over? [sighs] Was it real? [sighs] But what, is it over? No for real, Iâ€™m asking. Is it though? [soft grunt] Iâ€™m always like laughing and about to cry at any moment inside. Iâ€™m like [chuckles and grunts]. Was is real? Is it? You know whatâ€™s real? Divorce is real. Divorceâ€¦ [laughing] Divorce is real as fuck. Divorce is so real. I got divorced in the pandemic. It happened, you know. What are you gonna do? [whistling] We both one guyâ€™s happy.
[soft cheering and applause]
Itâ€™s not like those stories that you hear where a comedianâ€™s like, â€œFuck that bitch.â€ No. It just didnâ€™t work out. You know what I mean? And itâ€™s fine. And when youâ€™re married for so long youâ€™re just use to certain things. I was dead asleep one night. And then I farted so hard. [laughing] I farted so hard I woke up ashamed. Likeâ€¦ [gasps] Like this. [laughing] And I looked over to my left and I apologized. And there was nobody there! [laughs] [laughing] I just turned over and cried. I was likeâ€¦ [sobs] [laughing] I wrote that shit down immediately. Iâ€™m like, â€œThis is hilarious.â€ [sobs] [sobs then laughs] [laughing] Is it real? Was it? Is it real? I donâ€™t know. Fuck. [laughing] Itâ€™s how I feelâ€¦ [grunts] â€¦all the time.
Pandemi you know, what the media did to us was, honestly, it feels unforgivable. It really did. Itâ€™s like, â€œPanic!â€ [screams] â€œItâ€™s coming!â€ â€œWhatâ€™s coming?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s coming.â€ [laughing] [shouts] â€œThree people have it.â€ â€œWhat? Huh?â€ â€œItâ€™s coming!â€ â€œWhatâ€™s coming?â€ â€œSomething that has to do with a bat.â€ â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ â€œBats are coming?â€ â€œNo!â€ â€œIt came from a bat.â€ [laughing] â€œAnd itâ€™s this thing you canâ€™t see with your naked eye, but itâ€™s coming.â€ â€œYouâ€™re all gonna die.â€ [screams] â€œBut donâ€™t be scared.â€ â€œDonâ€™tâ€ â€œWhat do you mean?â€ â€œHuh?â€ â€œIâ€™m scared.â€ â€œIâ€™m worried.â€ [chuckles] â€œDonâ€™t worry, just get Chlorox.â€ â€œYouâ€™re gonna be fine.â€ [laughing] â€œGet as much Chlorox.â€
[soft applause]
â€œBut donâ€™t use the Chloroxâ€¦ [laughing] â€¦before you use Chlorox on the Chlorox.â€ â€œThen you could use the Chlorox, okay.â€ [laughing] â€œWhen you get packages, fucking bathe with the packages.â€ [laughing] They had us all a bunch of assholes. Weâ€™re likeâ€¦ [spraying noise] [laughing] â€œAmazon came in.â€ [spraying noise] [laughing] â€œItâ€™s fine, fan it out. Itâ€™s fine.â€

[screams] [laughing] â€œPut on a mask.â€ â€œHow many masks?â€ It kept changing. [laughing] â€œPut on a mask. One mask.â€, Fauci said. â€œOne mask is like 33% protection.â€ â€œTwo masks are like 66% protection.â€ [laughing] â€œThree masks are like 97% protection.â€ And then a plastic bag, just 100%. [laughing] Just kill yourself. Justâ€¦ [grunts] asphyxiate. â€œOh, no, we lost another one to COVID!â€ [laughing] â€œNah, bro, one more bag, bro. He killed himself.â€ [laughing] [huffs] â€œStay home. We figured it out.â€ â€œStay home.â€ â€œHow long?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ [laughs] â€œMonthses, I think.â€ [laughing] â€œHow many monthses?â€ â€œJust monthses, bro, I donâ€™t know.â€ [laughing] â€œItâ€™s gonna be monthses.â€ â€œHow many monthses?â€ â€œWe donâ€™t know.â€ [laughing] â€œYouâ€™re supposed to know.â€ â€œI know.â€ â€œBut we donâ€™t know.â€ â€œItâ€™s monthses. Just stay home.â€ â€œWell, I have to go to work.â€ â€œFuck your job,â€ they said. [laughing] â€œFuck your job.â€ â€œWhat do you mean, fuck my job?â€ â€œI donâ€™t have to pay rent?â€ â€œWhoa, hold on, take it easy.â€ [laughing] â€œCapitalism. Take it easy.â€ â€œYou still have to pay your rent.â€ â€œOh, so, hold on, but then I have to go to well, then, send me money. You know what just send me money.â€ â€œNo, whoa, what are you, a crackhead, bro?â€ [laughing] â€œWe canâ€™t send you money if ifâ€ â€œWhat are you talking about? We canâ€™t send youâ€ â€œWhy you stuttering a lot, bro?â€ â€œJust send me this money.â€ â€œWe we donâ€™t have any money, okay.â€ [soft laughing] â€œWe donâ€™t have anyâ€ â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ â€œWe send you money, but thatâ€™s how this works, okay.â€ â€œWe send you money and you allocate it for different buckets. Right. You got Social security, you got Medicare, Medicaid, thereâ€™s a lot of buckets.â€ â€œAnd Iâ€™m sure you have a rainy day fund.â€ â€œBro, you gotta have a rainy day fund.â€ â€œAnd itâ€™s pouring outside.â€ â€œFucking full blown hurricane season.â€ [laughing] â€œSeven hurricanes hitting at the same time.â€ â€œSend me some fucking money.â€ â€œI have a confession, weâ€™re broke. Okay.â€ [laughing] â€œWhat do you mean youâ€™re broke? Youâ€™re the federal government.â€ [laughs] â€œI know, I know.â€ I know, weâ€™re in debt, okay.â€ [chuckles] â€œWeâ€™re in debt, all right, itâ€™sâ€ [laughing] â€œItâ€™s a lot of itâ€™s debt, okay.â€ â€œHow much debt?â€ â€œWeâ€™re just minus okay. Weâ€™re justâ€¦â€ [laughing] â€œWeâ€™re justâ€ â€œI know what debt means, bro, just how much minus?â€ â€œItâ€™s a lot of minuses.â€ [laughing] â€œSo much minus. A lot of minus.â€ â€œJust spit it out. How much is it?â€ â€œTwenty trillion dollars.â€ [laughing] â€œTwenty trillion dollars?â€ â€œWhoâ€™s balancing this cheque book?â€ [laughing] â€œMC Hammer? Whoâ€™s managing this whole situation?â€ â€œHow did you get 20 trillion dollars minus?â€ â€œKilling Brown people is so expensive.â€ [audience cries out in surprise] â€œOh!â€ â€œItâ€™s so expensive.â€ [loud sigh] â€œJust so much. So as you can see, we canâ€™t send you money.â€ â€œIf weâ€™re in minus. Overdraft fees are piling up. We canâ€™tâ€¦ [laughing] send you out of minus.â€ [laughs] â€œWhat, Kyle?â€ â€œThe stock market is gonna fail?â€ â€œHoly shit, Kyle. Heat up the printer.â€ â€œHeat up the fucking printer.â€ [laughing] â€œMake three trillion dollars appear.â€ â€œAnd letâ€™s funnel it into the Ponzi scheme that is the stock market.â€ [soft laughing] Because the stock market is a direct reflection of American hearts everywhere. If the arrowâ€™s going down that means hearts and souls of Americans everywhere is also going down. â€œBut look itâ€™s working, itâ€™s going up!â€ â€œAmericans are happy again.â€ â€œItâ€™s going up.â€ [laughing] â€œItâ€™s sky rocketing!â€ â€œWait, wait, wait. How the fuck is it sky rocketing?â€ â€œWeâ€™re all at home. I thoughtâ€¦â€ [laughing] Iâ€¦
[laughing and applause]
â€œHow is itâ€¦â€
[soft laughing and applause]
â€œHowâ€¦â€ â€œHow is this thing going up?â€ â€œI thought it was all based off of revenue streams and quarterly earnings. And nobodyâ€™s working.â€ â€œI get Amazon. Shit.â€ [laughs] â€œEverybody is at home ordering, this should be sky rocketing.â€ â€œWell, fuck you, Jeff Bezos, and thank you, Jeff Bezos, all at the same time. â€œLike, but how is this still going up, bro?â€ â€œI thought this was all based off of money coming in. Everybodyâ€™s at home.â€ â€œLook man, shut the fuck up, okay!â€ [laughing] â€œJust look at the arrow. God, canâ€™t you just shut shut your mouth and just be happy that the arrowâ€™s going up?â€ â€œNo, I canâ€™t, bro. We need money.â€ â€œLook hereâ€™s $1,200. Hush money.â€ â€œShut the fuck up.â€
[laughing and applause]
â€œThank you. Thatâ€™ll last me a week. I appreciate that.â€ [laughs] â€œStop trying to distract me.â€ â€œHow the fuck is this arrow going up, though, for real?â€ â€œHomelessness is at an alltime high.â€ â€œLook, aliens are real. Chew on that for a little bit.â€ â€œWhat?â€ [laughing] â€œYou talk to them?â€ â€œYeah, bro, all the time, itâ€™s crazy.â€ â€œJust look at the arrow, all right.â€ â€œNo, still, like, so many unemployed.â€ â€œFifty million people unemployed. How the fuck is the arrow going up, bro?â€ â€œLook, Jada cheated on Will Smith. Chew on that for a little bit.â€ [laughing] â€œWhat?â€ â€œWhy, Jada, why?â€ [laughing] â€œWhat happened?â€ â€œSomething about entanglements, I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s crazy.â€ â€œJust look at the arrow.â€ â€œJust look at the fucking arrow.â€ â€œNo, for real, stop trying to distract me, bro. How is this arrow still going up, okay? Please explain yourself.â€ â€œLook, Iâ€™ve got a hot tip for you, okay.â€ â€œCryptocurrency.â€ [laughing] â€œWhat the fuck is cryptocurrency?â€ â€œItâ€™s these little people inside of a computer.â€ â€œAnd theyâ€™re just mining. Theyâ€™re just mining for these digital coins, okay.â€ â€œWhat you do is, you move the real fake money over to theâ€¦ [laughing] over to the more real fake money.â€ [laughing] â€œAnd what you do is, you just move, once you have more real fake money, you move your real fake money over hereâ€ â€œand you just keep doing that.â€ â€œIâ€™m so confused.â€ â€œHey, man, Iâ€™ve got another hot tip for you. NFTâ€™s.â€ â€œWhat the fuck is a NFT?â€ [shouts and laughing]
[applause]
â€œItâ€™s a blockchain of ownershipâ€¦â€ â€œYou know what, Iâ€™m just gonna put a plastic bag over my head. Fuck this shit.â€
[laughing and applause]
[cheering] Is it real? COVIDâ€™s real. I had it. Dave Chappelle gave me COVID. Thatâ€™s right. [laughing] Well, that was the second time. [laughing] But the first time, he hits me up right at the beginning of the pandemic. Heâ€™s like, â€œSay, Mo, what are you doing?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve been watching the news, bro.â€ â€œIâ€™m at home, dog, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing.â€ [laughing] â€œThatâ€™s what you do. Weâ€™re all at home. I donâ€™t know if you were watching.â€ He was like, â€œYeah, you canâ€™t let them break us.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWeâ€™re broken, bro.â€ â€œThe whole country is broken.â€ He was like, â€œThatâ€™s why Iâ€™m hitting you up.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna do these shows out in this cornfield in Ohio.â€ I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know, man, this doesnâ€™t sound very, Iâ€™m not sure, you know.â€ He was like, â€œNo, no.â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna test everybody every three days.â€ â€œItâ€™s gonna be very safe. Weâ€™re gonna do the best we can. Nothing is guaranteed, of course.â€ â€œWeâ€™re gonna do the best that we can, everyâ€ I was like, â€œYou have testing machines, bro? This is the beginning of the pandemic.â€ [laughing] â€œLike, how did you get testing machines?â€ He just went nuts, He was like, â€œSay, nigga, Iâ€™m Dave Chappelle. Of course I got theseâ€
[cheering and applause]
I was like, â€œGood point.â€ Really good point. So we go, I go to Ohio. And it was a amazing run of shows, like, almost four months of doing these shows. And we almost made it, but we had outbreaks and we had to stop it. And he made it into a documentary film. Itâ€™s an incredible documentary film. I saw it at Radio City Music Hall. It was the first time that I got to see it. And then I watched it and I was like, â€œWait, the end of the movie makes it look like I ruined the whole fucking party.â€ [laughing] I got COVID and the whole thing had to shut down because I was being a bitch. I was like, â€œWait, hold on a second.â€ I walked up to Dave. Iâ€™m like, â€œDave, the way you edited this, you made it look that Mohammed was the villain in the whole situation.â€ [laughing] â€œThatâ€™s not the truth, bro. I didnâ€™t doâ€ Heâ€™s like, â€œAh, man, nobodyâ€™s gonna think this.â€ And right after he walks away Bradley Cooper walks up. Heâ€™s like, â€œMan, this is really fucked up how you just ruined theâ€¦ [laughing] ruined the party in Ohio.â€ I was like, â€œIt wasnâ€™t me.â€ â€œAn awardwinning film maker is saying that this is what it looks like.â€ â€œOh, no!â€ And it wasnâ€™t my fault. It was this tiny little lady. She was really small. And she was handsy. Really handsy. [laughing] And she was touching me all the time. â€œHi, Mo.â€ [giggles] â€œHi.â€ [laughing] Just doing this all the time. Iâ€™m like, â€œHey, stop touching me right now.â€ â€œFirst of all, itâ€™s a pandemic. Like, I donâ€™t you that well enoughâ€ â€œand stop touching me, likeâ€ And then she fakecoughed in my face. [fake coughs] Like this. And I was like, â€œI love dark humor, but thatâ€™s [laughing] Thatâ€™s not funny!â€ â€œItâ€™s not funny, bitch. Itâ€™s not funny.â€ And then she tested positive three days later. [audience sympathizes] I was like, â€œI knew she was Israeli. I knew it.â€
[laughing and applause]
I knew it. I knew it. They were having a meeting in Hollywood. They were like, â€œThis Palestinianâ€™s getting too powerful.â€ [laughing] â€œJust send him this unassuming little gremlin to try and kill him with COVID.â€ I survived, bitch! I survived! [laughing] That was the first time I got COVID. [laughing] The second time, Dave Chappelle calls me again. [laughing] Saying, â€œMan, what you doing?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m recovering from COVID.â€ [laughing] Heâ€™s like, â€œIâ€™m gonna do these shows in Austin. Joe Rogan is gonna be on it.â€ â€œItâ€™s gonna be dope.â€ â€œYou should join.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œDave, I donâ€™t know if this really worked out for me the first time.â€ [laughing] And he was like, â€œNah, man, this is gonna be different.â€ â€œWe gonna test every day.â€ â€œLast time we were only testing every three days. Weâ€™re gonna test every day.â€ â€œSo we gonna catch that ho and put her in a closet.â€ [laughing] â€œYouâ€™d be straight.â€ I was like, â€œFuck it, letâ€™s do it.â€ [huffs] [laughing] Weâ€™re like ten days into doing shows and Dave walks up to me and heâ€™s like, â€œHey, man, I got this joint from JayZ.â€ I was like, â€œWord?â€ He was like, â€œYeah, I got this joint from JayZ.â€ I was like, â€œJayZâ€™s here?â€ He was like, â€œNah, man, JayZ has a weed company and he sent me these joints.â€ [laughing] â€œYou wanna go? Letâ€™s go roll around your car and letâ€™s smoke this together.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œShit, Dave Chappelle has a joint from JayZ asking Mo Amer if he wants to smoke this shit, youâ€™re damn right, Iâ€™m gonna smoke the shit out of this joint.â€
[cheering and applause]
Obvious. So then weâ€™re cruising and then he lights up the joint. And I shouldâ€™ve known better! Because he took a hit and then he goesâ€¦ [coughs] like this. [laughing] I was like, â€œYou okay, Dave?â€ He was like, â€œYeah, yeah, Iâ€™m fine.â€ â€œIâ€™m fine. This JayZ weed makes you do JayZ impressions likeâ€¦â€ [coughs] â€œDjeah!â€
[cheering and applause]
I took the joint. I took a couple of hits. I was like, [coughs] â€œâ€¦ djeahhova!â€ [chuckles] [laughing] Smoke it. We laughed. It was a great ride. And then I dropped Dave off because it was like 30 minutes until show time. And then I started texting him, I was like, â€œSay, bro, you want me to swoop you up?â€ â€œIs there special guests, should I come later?â€ And he went silent. And I was like, â€œThis is weird.â€ â€œDave, we just dropped you off, bro. This is really odd.â€ And then friends started texting me. They havenâ€™t heard from him in, like, weeks. They were like, â€œHey, man, is Dave okay?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, Daveâ€™s okay.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t know him, thatâ€™s my boy.â€ [laughing] â€œWhat are you talking about?â€ â€œWe just hanging out.â€ And then they sent me a link. I was like, â€œWhat is this link?â€ So I touched the link and it opens up. And itâ€™s TMZ front page news, â€œDave Chappelle tests positive for COVID.â€ [sympathy from audience] Then I was like, â€œThis canâ€™t be true!â€ And then I was like, â€œShit, Itâ€™s TMZ, theyâ€™re always right, these motherfuckers.â€ [laughing] I was like, â€œHow did they know before I knew?â€ â€œI just dropped off Dave.â€ â€œHe called them before he called me.â€ â€œFuck. Thatâ€™s fucked up, bro.â€ And then he tried to deny it. I walked up to him and I was like, â€œDave, itâ€™s fucked up you gave me COVID a second time.â€ And he goes, â€œThereâ€™s no way to really prove that, Mo.â€ [laughing] [laughs] I was like, â€œBro, the first day you tested positive I was smoking a joint with you.â€ â€œMinutes before you tested positive.â€ And he got silent and he just goes, â€œIâ€™m sorry I gave you COVID, bro.â€ [laughing] [huffs] And then he goes, â€œWalk it off, at least itâ€™s not AIDS.â€ And heâ€™s just walking around like this.
[laughing and applause]
[Mo laughs] Is it over? [chuckles] Is it? [grunts and laughs] [laughing] [laughs] So I am done. I had that shit twice. Okay. Fauci, â€œOnly seven people in the world have ever gotten it twiâ€ Bullshit! Iâ€™m special, but Iâ€™m not that fucking special, Fauci. [laughing] So Iâ€™m done. I had it twice. And Iâ€™m vaccinated. Iâ€™m over it. Iâ€™m over it. I got the Pfizer vaccine. [cheering] Thatâ€™s what I want. Everybody has their favorites, but I went with Pfizer. I wantâ€¦ [laughing] I want like a German scientist making my shit, you know what Iâ€™m saying? [laughing] I want the guy like, [in fake German accent] â€œYavi, hows the Pfizer? Ya!â€ â€œWe knew he was coming out of Wuhan.â€ â€œThe COVID. And we are way ahead of schedule.â€ â€œYa! We have the vaccine! The Pfizer!â€ Thatâ€™s the one I want. Thatâ€™s what I
[cheering and applause]
The what?
[cheering and applause]
â€œYaza!â€ [chuckles] â€œHmm, ya, iz good, ya, we have the Pfizer.â€ [chuckles] [laughing] â€œYou have the Pfizer? I have the Pfizer.â€ [laughing] [chuckles] Iâ€™m not doing Johnson & Johnson. Iâ€™m not doing that. [huffs] I donâ€™t even use their regular products. [laughing] And they make too many for my comfort, bro. [laughing] You want me to tell you like, â€œWhatâ€™s in the Johnson & Johnson?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know, man, like we just started off with a little snake venom in there.â€ [laughing] â€œAnd then we just added some Johnson & Johnson baby powder to thicken it up a bit.â€ [laughing] â€œSome Johnson & Johnson baby oil to loosen her up a bit.â€ â€œThen we put a goddamn baby in there.â€ [laughing] â€œJust a whole fucking baby.â€ â€œAnd we finished it off with a little wild turkey to give it that pop!â€ â€œKnow what I mean?â€
[laughing and applause]
â€œHow many shots do I take?â€ â€œNo shots, we just pass it mouth to mouth.â€ â€œYou just come on nowâ€¦â€ [laughs]
[laughing and applause]
Itâ€™s so absurd. I [huffs] Itâ€™s so absurd, like [huffs] Like, vaccines having accents is so ab [chuckles] Whatâ€™s Moder [huffs] Whatâ€™s Moderna? [imitating Mexican accent] [laughing] â€œYou got that derna, bro?â€ â€œWe give you one shot then you Crip Walk out this bitch.â€ You know what I mean. Like, bra, lets do it?â€ [laughing] Like Iâ€™m g [chuckles] That derna. [chuckles] [grunts and exhales sharply] [laughing] Fuck! [laughing] Thatâ€™s how I feel inside. [soft laughing] I do. Thatâ€™s how I feel inside. All the time. Fuck. [laughing] All the time. Iâ€™m justâ€¦ [grunts] fuck. [laughing] [grunts] Fuck. And fuck is just not a potent enough word, to be honest with you. Itâ€™s not strong. Once you speak another language, you realize, you realize that the English language is just like a newborn, you know. [laughing] It is. Itâ€™s a new language. Like, I speak Arabic. Arabic is an ancient language. [sighs] English is like itâ€™s baby. It wants to grow up and be Arabic one day and itâ€™s justâ€¦ [laughing] It is, itâ€™s justâ€¦
[cheering and applause]
No, itâ€™s fine. Itâ€™s just a baby. Itâ€™s just a baby. Itâ€™s not a It lacks a lot of depth. Itâ€™s just not, itâ€™s just not very strong, like â€œfuckâ€, itâ€™s nothing. Itâ€™s an exclamation point, you know. Even greetings in Arabic takes so long, you know. [soft laughing] Greetings are like, â€œPeace be upon you.â€ â€œAnd may peace be upon you.â€ â€œAnd the mercy of the divine be upon you.â€ â€œAnd may the mercy of the divine be upon you.â€ â€œAnd may divine light be with you.â€ â€œMay it be unto you as well.â€ â€œMay it protect you and your entire lineaâ€ â€œHey, man, can I get this pack of cigarettes, bro, and get out of here?â€
[laughing and applause]
Itâ€™s a lot. Itâ€™s a lot. In English, itâ€™s, â€œHi.â€ [laughs] Thatâ€™s it. Itâ€™s over. [laughing] [chuckles] Itâ€™s over. [chuckles] â€œWhatâ€™s up? The sky?â€ [mock giggles] Thatâ€™s it, thereâ€™s nothing else. [laughs] Itâ€™s nothing. [laughs] So when somebody curses you in English, sincerely, you could probably walk away 99.9% of the time if you didnâ€™t get emotionally charged. Really. Itâ€™s an oldie but a goodie. â€œHey, fuck you!â€ â€œI donâ€™t wanna fuck you.â€ [laughing] And you could, just walk away. [soft laughing] â€œHey, go fuck yourself!â€ â€œYou know what, man? Iâ€™ve been really tense lately.â€ [laughing] â€œAnd maybe what I need to do is go fuck myself.â€ [laughing] â€œHey, youâ€™re a motherfucker.â€ â€œNot my mom, butâ€¦â€ [laughing] â€œMy exwife did have child from a previous marriage, so I guess I am a motherfucker.â€ [soft laughing] â€œAnd by the way, your father, biggest motherfucker of them all, technically.â€ [laughing and a whoop] â€œHey, youâ€™re an asshole!â€ â€œYou know what, the eye cannot see itself.â€
[laughing]
[applause]
â€œAnd I cannot see when Iâ€™m being an asshole, so thank you for making me a better person.â€ And just walk away. â€œHey! Youâ€™re a pussy!â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™ll take that.â€ I donâ€™t know why â€œpussyâ€ always insinuates weakness. Pussy is metaphorically and physically very strong. [loud cheering] So strong!
[cheering and applause]
Itâ€™s true. Absolutely true. Itâ€™s so strong. It can have a baby. Human life. [whoop] Pounds of human flesh can come out of this little, tiny hole. Pop! And it can have two at the same time. Pop! Pop! [laughing] It can have three. Pop, pop, pop. [laughing] And then it regeneratesâ€¦ like this. [laughing] Almost. Exactly how it was. Almost. [laughing] Almost. Exactly how it was. Maybe if you laugh or cough, you piss on yourself, but otherwiseâ€¦ [laughing] Otherwise, itâ€™s there. Ready for you once again. [laughs] [laughing] [laughing] My friend, Chris, passed a kidney stone out of his dick hole. [laughing] He damn near died, okay. [laughing] He was like, â€œOh, God, whatâ€™s happening to me?â€ He was like, â€œSomebody shoot me!â€ And it was a grain of sand that came out of his dick hole. Women, â€œPop! Pop!â€ Come back. [laughing] Little grain of sandâ€¦ [groans] [laughing] You be a dick. Iâ€™ll be a pussy any day of the week.
[loud cheering and applause]
[cheering and whistling]
Arabic curse words. [soft laughing] Theyâ€™re really graphic. [laughing] Theyâ€™re so graphic I donâ€™t even use them. Honestly, I justâ€¦ Weâ€™re gonna start here and build up. [laughing] Like â€œKes Emakâ€, which meansâ€¦ [murmurs] â€¦â€Fuck your motherâ€™s pussy!â€ [laughing] Very specific. [laughing] [Mo huffs] We take that to another level. â€œKes Emak Eli Nafadekâ€ which meansâ€¦ [laughing] Which me two people, â€œYeah, I know what that means.â€ [laughing] [chuckles] Everybody else is on their toes, â€œWhat does it mean?â€ [laughing] It mea â€œKes Emak Eli Nafadekâ€ which means, â€œFuck the pussy you slithered out of!â€ Wow! [shocked laughing] [Mo laughs] Astaghfirullah I know, itâ€™s crazy. [laughing] [indistinct] Everyone saw the baby fall out. Itâ€™s a visual curse word, that one. [laughing] This is one of my personal favorites, â€œYela3n Tarekhekâ€, Which means, which means, â€œDamn your entire history.â€ [laughing] â€œMy greatgrandmother?â€ â€œNo, bitch, from the beginning of timeâ€¦â€ [laughing] â€œâ€¦to present day and everything in between and in the future, fuck your DNA.â€ [laughing] Astaghfirullah, I donâ€™t need this. Itâ€™s a lot. Even Western hand gestures. Not that big of a deal. â€œUh, fuck you bro, uh.â€ [laughing] In England itâ€™s a reverse peace sign. Very confusing. [in fake English accent] â€œOh, fuck off, oh.â€ [laughing] And they try to be like, â€œNo, itâ€™s from the war, yeah.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œShut the fuck up, okay. [laughing] â€œItâ€™s not that cool.â€ Arabs, we go to another level. We go sideways, we go â€œBeTizikâ€, like this. [laughing] BeTizik, like that. BeTizik, like this. A little popâ€¦
[laughing and applause]
BeTizik, like that. [laughing] Little wiggle. BeTizik, like that. BeTizik, likeâ€¦ [laughs] This means â€œin your ass.â€ Thatâ€™s what this means. [laughing] Thatâ€™s whatâ€¦ [laughs] [laughing] And if thereâ€™s any confusion, you just put the other hand up like this and you go BeTizik, like this. [laughing] And you wiggle it. You wiggle it, all up in the ass, thatâ€™s right!
[laughing and applause]
I feel like a lot of people are gonna be leaving here, like, â€œHey, Kyle.â€ â€œYeah.â€ BeTizik bro! [laughing] [Mo laughs] [laughing] Fuck! [soft laughing] [grunting] [soft laughing] [laughs and soft grunts] [laughing] [in Mexican accent] â€¦bro. [soft laughing] Mexicanoâ€™s, bro. I love Mexicanoâ€™s.
[cheering and applause]
Let me say, growing up in Alief, you canâ€™tâ€¦ [whoop and cheers] we canâ€™t. You canâ€™tâ€¦ You grew up around Mexicanoâ€™s. You do. And they always sound like theyâ€™re in pain. [in fake Mexican accent] â€œCome on, bro, letâ€™s hang out.â€ [laughing] â€œYou all right?â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™m doing fine, bro.â€ â€œAre you sure?â€ [soft laughing] Love Mexicanoâ€™s. Theyâ€™re resilient people, hard working people. And itâ€™s fucked up they even started a conversation about putting a wall up. Shit, this never worked it human history. And you keep repeating the same bullshit. First of all, itâ€™s Mexicans. Most creative people I know. Huh? Itâ€™s likeâ€¦
[cheering and applause]
So creative, the Palestinians were taking notes and shit. When El Chapo snuck out of that tunnel with a motorcycle, weâ€™re like, [in Arabic accent] â€œHey, Abdallah, come watch, bro.â€ [laughing] â€œHey, he put a motorcycle inside a tunnel, bro?â€ â€œWe need to do this back home.â€ Ya Habibi Ya Allah. [laughing] Youâ€™re not gonna stop Mexicans, bro. Itâ€™s not gonna work. Put up a wall and theyâ€™ll just zipline back into the country and shit. Theyâ€™ll be like, [in Spanish] â€œReady, JosÃ©, Iâ€™m ready.â€ Push me, motherfucker. Come on, go fuck your mother.
[cheering and applause]
[in English] Theyâ€™d be like, â€œDid he make it?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know, bro.â€ [laughing] â€œI think he missed the trampoline.â€ [laughing] â€œZiplining, this is so tricky.â€ [laughing] â€œTiming is everything, bro.â€ [laughs] [laughing] If I was Mexican living in Mexico, Iâ€™d flip the whole script. I would. Iâ€™d be like, â€œYou know what, bro?â€ â€œWeâ€™re building a wall, okay.â€ [laughing] â€œWeâ€™re building a wall. You canâ€™t come to CancÃ¹n no more, puto. How about that?â€ [laughing and cheering] How about that? Thatâ€™s it. Youâ€™d have the White girls Youâ€™d have White girls crying all across America. [laughing] Theyâ€™re like, [imitating a girl] â€œOh, my God.â€ â€œI just wanted to go to CancÃ¹n for Spring Break.â€ â€œWhy are they so racist? I donâ€™t understand.â€ [laughing] â€œNow I have to go to Puerto Vallarta.â€ [laughing] Thatâ€™s also in Mexico. [girl voice] â€œOh, my God!â€ [laughing]
[soft laughing and applause]
Love Mexicanoâ€™s. I love doing accents. Itâ€™s a lot of fun, you know. When you can do them like, [in fake Mexican accent] â€œCome on, letâ€™s hang out, itâ€™sâ€ Itâ€™s fun. The Germanâ€™s fun.

The only people that would do this, is Dagestaniâ€™s. Because thereâ€™s levels to being Russian. Thereâ€™s like regular Russian, thereâ€™s Chechnyan, and thereâ€™s Dagestaniâ€™s! Itâ€™s a whole another level, where they wrestle bears, apparently. And from childhood. What the fuck are you talking about? His father, God rest his soul, were the greatest coaches of all time.

Red or blue?â€ What am I, Bloods or Crips? Thatâ€™s what I heard. Thatâ€™s all I heard. All you are gangsters. Okay. Okay, all of you are gangsters. Iâ€™m with the people. Always will be with the people. Thatâ€™s what it is about for me. When the hurricane came through, my neighbor, Scott, redneck Scott, this guy is the best. Okay. Heâ€™s always prepared. So Iâ€™m never prepared, because I know heâ€™s prepared. [laughing] Heâ€™s always like, â€œYeah. I got generators. Hell yeah, I got generators.â€ â€œFuck, yeah, Mohammed, I got you, baby.â€ You know. [laughing] When I came through he hooked me up, bro. I plugged into the side of his house and took that extension cord all the way across that culdesac and plugged my shit in. And thatâ€™s what itâ€™s about, bro. Theyâ€™re trying to separate us, but the fact is Mohammedâ€™s in Texas get along with redneck Scotts all day.
[cheers and applause]
Fuck what you talking about. Fuck what you talking about. Thatâ€™s the honest truth. People try to just push this particular agenda and itâ€™s not, I do believe in us. I do. I believe in us and then and then I travel and then I go to an airport and I realize how fragmented we really are. We suck as the human race. We suck. [laughs] Weâ€™re all in our own bubbles. Nobodyâ€™s paying attention to anybody else. Everybody just Youâ€™ll see this in an airport. Youâ€™d be walking and all of a sudden the person in front of you just stops and just looks up. â€œWhatâ€™s up there?â€ â€œIâ€™ll tell you whatâ€™s behind you, bitch.â€ â€œThousands of people.â€ [laughing] â€œTrying to get where they want to go.â€ â€œThatâ€™s what the fuck is going on.â€ â€œWhat the hell is wrong with you?â€ â€œGet the fuck out of the way, all right.â€ [soft laughing] If youâ€™re travelling with a carryon with no wheels on it, youâ€™re an asshole, okay. [laughing] You just have them all over your shoulder. Youâ€™re a fucking mess. [panting] Itâ€™s sliding off. â€œOh, sorry.â€ [panting] Wheels exist. Whatâ€™s the matter with you? [soft laughing] If you have a carryon with only two wheels, this is what you look like, â€œHi.â€ [giggles] Look how much square footage youâ€™re taking behind you. Why the fuck are you doing this? â€œHi.â€ [giggles] [fake laughs] [laughing] What the fuck are you doing? Four wheels exist, man. This is what you look like in four wheels. Like a smart, intelligent human being. You can go forward. You can go backwards on that whore. You can juke a motherfucker and just keep going. [laughing] You have a baby, you put him on top of it and you keep it cruising. [laughing] Now if you have a four wheel carryon and you only use two wheels, youâ€™re probably the biggest asshole of them all. [laughing] We canâ€™t even read numbers. We get to the boarding gate and theyâ€™re like, â€œBoardingâ€¦â€ â€œBoarding group one.â€ [high pitched voice] â€œIâ€™m in seven, can I go?â€ [giggles] â€œWell, what heâ€ â€œIâ€™m in eight since sevenâ€™s going.â€ â€œGet the fuck out of the way. What are you doing?â€ [laughing] Then you get on the plane and here comes the people with no wheels on their bags. [panting] Just clotheslining every other person. [thumping noises] [laughing] They have no clue, they justâ€¦ [panting] And here comes the assholes with two wheels on their bags. Just dragging it behind themâ€¦ [laughing] â€¦and theyâ€™re getting stuck every other seat. â€œSorry, sorry.â€ [fake laughs] â€œSorry.â€ [fake laughs] Turn it around, whore, and see where youâ€™re going.
[laughing and applause]
Use your eyes. Maneuver. [sighs] Drives me insane. [laughs] Flight attendants, all due respectâ€¦ [whoop] Well, I would wait to finish the bit, bro. [laughs] [laughing] Itâ€™s not good. Youâ€™re not saving anyone, all right. You take your job way too seriously. [laughs] [laughing] Somebody has an issue, you just go, â€œIs there a doctor here? Because I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. Please, somebody.â€ [laughing] If you have a little bag and itâ€™s a bulkhead, and you have it on the floor, oh, shit. [loud breathing] â€œWe have to put this bag over here.â€ Theyâ€™ll shortcircuit on you. â€œWe have to put this bag up top, okay. Just for take off. And they will give it to you immediately after takeoff, okay.â€ â€œWell, then, if you gonna give it to me after takeoff, immediately after takeoff, then why the fuck have I got to move it in the first place?â€ â€œJust in case we have an emergency exit situation.â€ â€œWait, weâ€™re gonna exit the plane?â€ â€œAt like 150 miles an hour?â€ â€œWhat the fuck are you talking about?â€ â€œNo, no, no, we have to move the bag.â€ â€œAccording to the FAAAAA.â€ [imitates explosion] [laughing] Shut down. God damn shut down. God, the safety announcements. Oh, my God. â€œPut on your seatbelt, everybody.â€ â€œBecause thatâ€™s whatâ€™s gonna save your life. Okay.â€ â€œYes, a seatbelt from 35,000 feetâ€¦ [laughing] â€¦to pummel into your imminent death. Okay.â€ â€œOn a floating rock in space.â€ â€œThatâ€™s whatâ€™s gonna save you, is a seatbelt.â€ No. They just want your ass in the seat after the plane crashes. They donâ€™t want to have to hire a thirdparty company to look for your bitch ass. [laughing] Thatâ€™s all it is. They donâ€™t. They just want to get there after the crash, â€œAdams 3F. There he is, yup.â€ [laughs] [laughing] â€œWell, most of him, right.â€ [laughs] [laughing] Itâ€™s all they want. [huffs] Because if they really thought the seatbelt was gonna save your life, they would check every single person as if itâ€™s a roller coaster ride, right. Theyâ€™d be like, â€œYouâ€™re good. Youâ€™re good. Youâ€™re good.â€ â€œYou goo Oh, you almost died, Ralph!â€ [laughing] â€œYou almost died.â€ They donâ€™t do that shit. They just walk by. â€œYouâ€™re good. Youâ€™re fine. Fine.â€ [laughing] One flight attendant started to argue with me, â€œNo, Mo, what if weâ€™re having a crash landing and we have real bad turbulence, you could fly up and you could break your neck!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œThatâ€™s what I want. I want to break my neck.â€ â€œI want to be the motherfucker like this while everybodyâ€™s screaming for their lives. Thatâ€™s what I want.â€ And while everybodyâ€™s like, â€œOh, my God! Were gonna die!â€ Iâ€™m already dead. Iâ€™m good to go. [laughing] Just smacking motherfuckers with no wheels on their bags. [smacking noises] [laughing] Thatâ€™s what I want. [soft laughing] [huffs] Yes, I remember, if we lose cabin pressure, me first, fuck the baby. [laughing] The little oxygen thing comes down. Me first, fuck the baby. Not my rule. Your rule. [laughing] Flew in from New York to Houston. Okay. I live here, but we flew in from New York to Houston and thereâ€™s not a single body of water in sight. But we have to worry about this flotation device, everybody. You put the thing on over and you buckle up the front. And then you pull the stringâ€¦ [swoosh noise] like that. And it will inflate. But if it doesnâ€™t inflate, donâ€™t panic! Thereâ€™s a straw right here. [laughing] That only, apparently, requires one breath. One magical breath. They make this shit look so easy. Justâ€¦ [blows] â€œYouâ€™re fine everybody, youâ€™re fine.â€ Bitch, have you ever tried to inflate anything manually in your whole life? [laughing] I did my nephewâ€™s pool party. I damn near died doing his floaties. [laughing] Youâ€™re telling me in the middle of a crash landing, weâ€™ll be likeâ€¦ [screams and blows] [laughing] Dead. [laughing] Donâ€™t worry, thereâ€™s a second and third layer of protection, okay. Thereâ€™s a little flickering light, okay. Itâ€™s not even a light. Itâ€™s a reflective light the size of a dime, I shit you not. The size of a dime and a whistle. Okay. In the vast, echoy, reflective oceans of the Earth, this is how weâ€™re gonna find your bitch assâ€¦ [mock whistle noise] â€œIâ€™m right here.â€ [mock laughs] [whistle noise] â€œIâ€™m right here.â€ [mock laugh] [whistle noise] â€œYou havenâ€™t found the Malaysia plane.â€ [laughing] â€œAn entire jumbo jet, bitch.â€
[cheers and applause]
Youâ€™re gonna find my bitch ass, just floating aroundâ€¦ [whistle noise] â€œIâ€™m right here.â€ [whistle noise] â€œIâ€™m right here.â€ You just told all the oceanâ€™s predators your exact location. Youâ€™re dead. BeTizik is what Iâ€™m saying. [grunts]
[laughing and applause]
[grunting and laughs] [laughs] [laughing] Fuck! [laughing] For the first time, for the first time I ever felt this way in my life. Iâ€™m a refugee that came to America, Iâ€™m an American citizen, of course, now. But, you know, for the first time everybody that was making fun of Texas in California, right in the middle of the pandemic, â€œOh, we need to go to Texas.â€ Yeah? â€œYou need to come here?â€ For the first time I felt this way, â€œGo back to where you came from, son of a bitch.â€ [laughing] â€œYouâ€™re fucking up our real estate.â€
[cheers and applause]
â€œGo back home.â€ Thatâ€™s how I feel. Thatâ€™s howâ€¦ I was like, â€œI get why they do it. It felt good, a little bit. It felt good.â€ [soft laughing] I am an ArabAmerican. Thatâ€™s what I am. Didnâ€™t do it. Yup.
[cheering and applause]
PalestinianArabAmer This isâ€¦ [cheering and whistling] Listen. Thank you. All right, letâ€™s start that party. Letâ€™s do it. Hereâ€™s the thing. Iâ€™m not doing that for applause. I did that just to tell you thatâ€™s how you identify yourself. I am an ArabAmerican. Thatâ€™s how it works here in America. If youâ€™re not White, you have something before American. [laughing] Unless when Iâ€™m buying a gun. Thatâ€™s the only time. When youâ€™re buying a gun in Texas, the first question is, â€œAre you hispanic?â€ Super racist. â€œNo.â€ [laughs] Next, â€œAre you AfricanAmericâ€ â€œNo.â€ [laughs] And then there, has no ArabAmerican. I was like, you know what, fuck it, â€œIâ€™m White as fuck today.â€ â€œGive me that double barrel, 12 gauge shot gun, baby.â€ [laughing] But all the other times, all the other times, Iâ€™m ArabAmerican. Youâ€™re not White in America, you have something before American. Thatâ€™s how it works out. Thatâ€™s just the way it is. [laughs] Okay. Unless youâ€™re White. Youâ€™re just White. Everybody else, something right before American. Even Natives. Natives are natives. Native Americans. We got to identifyâ€¦ [laughing] â€¦the Native Americans. African Americans. Most of my Black friends have never been to Africa. Nonetheless, theyâ€™re African Americans anyway. MexicanAmericans, AsianAmericans, and so forth and so on. Unless youâ€™re White. If youâ€™re White, you just sprouted from the corn fields of Ohio. [laughing] And you just spread across this great land. Unless itâ€™s Saint Paddyâ€™s day, then youâ€™re like, â€œOh, shit, my greatgranddaddy was a quarter Irish.â€
[laughing and applause]
[huffs] Thatâ€™s what I am though, an ArabAmerican. And I got to say, as an ArabAmerican, I find it really fascinating to see our culture spreading throughout the West. Really fascinating. It is.
[cheering and applause]
Itâ€™s pretty damn cool. Like, if you donâ€™t know what a hookah is, youâ€™re like culturally ignorant. And if you donâ€™t know what a hookah isâ€¦ â€œYou donâ€™t know what a hookah is, Denise? Where have you been?â€ [giggles] â€œItâ€™s like this bong, but itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s like so ornate and it has all these different tobaccos flavors. And then thereâ€™s this pipe that comes out. And you just prrr.â€ â€œBlow it out, itâ€™s so We can get two pipes and we can brrr together, Denise. Oh, my God.â€ [laughs] And then White people saw this, which is amazing. You got to give it up. They distilled it into a battery and put a cartridge on top of it with some mysterious liquid that nobodyâ€™s questioning. [laughing] Everybody just walk around likeâ€¦ [snorts] [growly exhale] [laughing] â€œItâ€™s perfectly healthy.â€ â€œBro, Iâ€™ve never seen that much smoke come out of a hookah.â€ [laughing] â€œMuch less this little device.â€ â€œYouâ€™re changing weather climates on a regular basis.â€ â€œWhat the fuck is going on?â€ â€œNo, itâ€™s healthy.â€ [mock laughs] [snorts and growly exhale] â€œIt canâ€™t be, bro. Itâ€™s a metal with some battery hooked up to some metal. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re fucked.â€ â€œPlease stop doing this.â€ [laughing] Thatâ€™s the first public service announcement. [soft laughing] The second public service announcement, something that Redd Foxx actually tried to spread in America in the early 70â€™s. And I would say that most Muslims living in the West are all wondering whyâ€¦ nobody wash their ass. Iâ€™m just gonna say it. [laughs] [laughing]
[cheers and applause]
Itâ€™s really weird. Please wash your ass. [laughs] Itâ€™s really weird that bidets are like not the norm, you know what I mean? Why is toilet paper the first and only option? Itâ€™s like, thatâ€™s it. Itâ€™s like leaves, toilet paper, baby wipes, and water. Why? Why would you do this? Itâ€™s obvio Everybodyâ€™s eating ass. Nobodyâ€™s washing their ass. Itâ€™s crazy. [loud laughing] Itâ€™s crazy. If you got shit on you, youâ€™re like, â€œOh, my God, I got shit.â€ You would wash it off right away. Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, Iâ€™m okay now.â€ â€œI got the shit off of me.â€ But when you go, youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m fine.â€ And you just walkâ€¦ [laughing] [huffs] My cousin came to visit me from back home. And he was like, â€œHey, I want to try fivestar hotel.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBro, of course. Enjoy yourself.â€ And he does it. And I said, â€œHey, man, Iâ€™ll pick you up at noon at the mall. Next day.â€ He was like, â€œOkay.â€ And I picked him up the next day and I see him, he had this really upset look on his face. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatâ€™s going on, bro?â€ He was like this. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatâ€™s going on, bro?â€ He was like, â€œAllah Yoqrifhemâ€. â€œAllah Yoqrifhemâ€. I was like, â€œBro, you canâ€™t be yelling Allah in the middle of the Galleria Mall like this.â€ [laughing] â€œWhat are you doing?â€ â€œRelax.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s the problem?â€ He goes, â€œThey donâ€™t have a bidet.â€ â€œThey donâ€™t have a bidet. Five star hotel!â€ â€œNot one star, two star, three star, four star, five star hotel! No bidet.â€ â€œEvery time I go to the bathroom, I have to take a shower.â€ [laughing] â€œIâ€™ve taken five showers today, Mo.â€ [laughing] â€œIâ€™m more worried about your digestional tract, bro.â€ [laughing] â€œFive shits before noon. What are you doing?â€ [laughing] â€œStop eating at IHOP, okay.â€ [laughing] My friend Nick came over. I upgraded all my toilets after my first Netflix special. Those Japanese toilets. And my friend Nick walks into the bathroom. He walks right back out. Heâ€™s like, â€œHey, Mo, why does, uh, your toilet have a remote?â€ [laughing] I was like, â€œOh, because it has a builtin bidet and blow dryer.â€ He was like, â€œWhatâ€™s a bidet?â€ I was like, â€œYou donâ€™t know what a bidet is?â€ He was like, â€œNo.â€ I was like, â€œOh, my God, I failed you.â€ [laughing] I was likeâ€¦ I was like, â€œA bidet is once you go booboo, it sprays water up your around your ass and washes your ass.â€ His response to me was, â€œEw.â€ I was like, â€œEw?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNick, youâ€™re the â€˜ewâ€™ in this equation, bro.â€ Get in there and wash your ass.
[laughing and applause]
[cheering and applause]
He was in there for like 20 minutes, man. He came out like he was baptized. He was likeâ€¦ He was likeâ€¦ [singsong] Ahahah!
[laughing and applause]
He had a stride in his step. A new confidence Iâ€™ve never seen before. [laughing] Second public service announcement. The third one starts off with a question. Imagine itâ€™s World War II era. Okay. Very important. Imagine itâ€™s World War II era in America. And Iâ€™m walking around the States like, â€œHey, would you like to try some of this sushi?â€ Theyâ€™d be like, â€œOh, whatâ€™s sushi?â€ Youâ€™d be like, â€œSushi is a Japanese dish.â€ Theyâ€™d be like, â€œJapanese!â€ â€œGet this damn Japfood out of my face!â€ [soft laughing] Probably what they would say. [soft laughing] Now imagine itâ€™s September 12th, 2001, and Iâ€™m walking around the States like, â€œHey, would you like to try some of this hummus?â€ Theyâ€™d be like, â€œOh, whatâ€™s hummus?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, hummus is a very Arab dish.â€ Theyâ€™d be like, â€œArab!â€ [bash noise] â€œGet this damn sandniggaalQaidafood out of my face!â€ [laughing] Itâ€™s probably what they would say. [soft laughing] Hereâ€™s a very important clarification, the way you say it is â€œhummusâ€. Itâ€™s an â€œhâ€. Itâ€™s a â€œhaâ€. Okay. Jews, itâ€™s not [Jewish accent] hummus. Okay. [Jewish accent] Itâ€™s not hummus. Itâ€™s not hummus. â€œGheâ€ is a different letter in our alphabet. Okay. In our lang â€œGheâ€ is a completely different letter. You donâ€™t have the â€œgheâ€ in your language. So obviously itâ€™s not yours. Back the fuck up. Itâ€™s our hummus.
[cheering and applause]
Back up. Itâ€™s what it is. All right. And now hummus is everywhere. â€œOh, I want some hummus.â€ Hummus, some shitty hummus everywhere. Fucking coffee shops have hummus. Seven Elevens have hummus. Every gas station, hummus, hummus, hummus. I was on a flight and the flight attendant comes up, â€œWould you like to have a little light snack?â€ I looked at it. I was like, â€œWhat the fuck is this?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œThis is hummus.â€ I was like, â€œNo, itâ€™s not.â€ This is a little juice box situation. You rip off a little corner and you get a little potato chip like this. And you squeeze it out. Just metaphorically shitting on my entire lineage. â€œFuck your history.â€ Thatâ€™s how it feels.
[laughing and applause]
Thatâ€™s how it feels. â€œFuck your grandmother with every shit of hummus that comes out of this thing. Ugh.â€ Itâ€™s not hummus. [soft laughing] I went to Trader Joeâ€™s and they have those samples like, â€œHey, would you like to try a some of this chocolate hummus? I was like, â€œWhat the fuck? Itâ€™s chocolate hummus.â€ [laughing] And then I just fainted like building seven. I just fainted. [soft laughing] We got to talk about it at some point. [laughing] Went to this South African fine dining South African restaurant when we were filming the movie in Atlanta. And the waiter comes over and heâ€™s like, â€œSay, bra, we have some red bean hummus here.â€ I was like, â€œWhat the fuck did you just say?â€ He goes, â€œWe have some red bean hummus here.â€ I was like, â€œBro, are there chickpeas in this?â€ He goes, â€œNah, bra, itâ€™s red bean hummus.â€ I was like, â€œBitch, hummus means chickpeas!â€ [laughing] This is refried beans, dog.
[laughing and applause]
Frijoles refritos homie. â€œYouâ€™re pawning off Mexican food now?â€ â€œAs hummus? Get this shit out of my face!â€ Hummus is very simple. Itâ€™s four ingredients, sometimes five. Thatâ€™s all it is. You get your chickpeas, tahini paste, lemon juice, salt, sometimes garlic. Okay. You get your food processor out. Itâ€™s like a little science experiment. Put it all in there, youâ€™re likeâ€¦ [blending noise] â€œNo, no, no. More tahini paste.â€ [blending noise] â€œNo, no, no. More lemon juice.â€ [blending noise] Youâ€™re like, â€œFuck, itâ€™s all lemon juice.â€ More chickpeas. More tahini paste. â€œFuck, itâ€™s all tahini paste again.â€ â€œMore lemon juice.â€ [blending noise] Like, â€œFuck, itâ€™s all lemon juice. Needs salt.â€ â€œChickpeas and tahini paste.â€ [blending noise] Youâ€™re like, â€œFuck, more tahini paste.â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, thatâ€™s perfect.â€
[cheering and applause]
Now you have 20 pounds of hummus right here. [laughing] [huffs] [laughing] This is very important. You scoop out the hummus and you put it in a bowl. Okay. You put the hummus in a bowl! You donâ€™t put it on a flat plate. Nobody know how to dip on a flat plate, bro. You got like race track marks everywhere. [laughing] You got hummus coming over the sides. Complete chaos. You need a bowl to help you with the scoop situation. Okay. Now weâ€™re not done yet. You got that bowl of hummus and you make a little crater right in the middle. Grab some fresh chickpeas, you put it right in the middle for texture. Okay. And then you grab some olive oil. Not that clear yellow shit. Some deep green olive oil. â€œOh, what do I do with that?â€ â€œDo I just drizzle, a little drizzle of garnish?â€ â€œNo, whore. You turn it overâ€¦ [laughing] â€¦and you hold it. Okay.â€ â€œOne Mississippi, two, three, four.â€ â€œIf you think itâ€™s too much, itâ€™s not enough. Keep it going.â€ [laughing] Okay. I like to finish it off with a little lemon juice. And some diced up jalapenos. And I put them on each corner like that. Now if I serve you this extremely authentic Palestinian hummus and you grab a carrot, Iâ€™m gonna fuck you up, okay. [laughing] â€œI just want to try it and Iâ€™m watching my carbs.â€ â€œItâ€™s not for you, ho. Back the fuck up!â€ [laughing] You need some fresh hot, fresh hot steamy pita bread. You rip off a little corner like this. And you put it together. And it just binds because itâ€™s so steamy. You make a perfect cone and when you dip, you dip like thisâ€¦ You dip towards yourself. You donâ€™t dip out! Youâ€™re like, â€œOh, I wanna taste like what itâ€™s like on that side.â€ â€œBitch, itâ€™s the same hummus on each side. Okay.â€
[laughing and applause]
â€œNobody wants your stinky ass fingers in their hummus, all right.â€ â€œOh, but I wanna taste whatâ€™s on that side.â€ â€œYou know what, Iâ€™m gonna put a wall right in the middle of the hummus.â€
[cheering and applause]
â€œPut a wall right here.â€ All right. That side is hummus. This side is hummus. I was looking for a onebowl solution, but you wonâ€™t share, so BeTizik is what Iâ€™m saying.
[cheering and applause]
Thank you so much, Houston. I love you. Thank you so much.
[cheering and applause]
[Mo] Man, I love you all. Take a seat, take a seat. What a beautiful thing. What a beautiful gathering. I take all of this very, very seriously. Iâ€™m gonna tell you why itâ€™s all so important to me. It took me 20 years to get my citizenship. Itâ€™s talked about in my first special. I am Palestinian and it was the first time I was able to actually go back to Palestine. [whoops and cheers] Because youâ€™re not allowed, youâ€™re not allowed to go back, even though my motherâ€™s born there, my greatgrandmotherâ€™s born there, my grandmother, my greatgrandmotherâ€¦ We have a thousand years of history there. Still cannot go there until you get your US passport. And itâ€™s still an obstacle when you get there, you know. When you first get there, like, â€œWhere you from?â€ â€œBitch, where are you from?â€ [laughing] And she said, â€œUzbekistan.â€ Itâ€™s tough. Itâ€™s a difficult thing. You always think about going home. Your mom talks about it. You see my family back home. And you want to go see it. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m saying â€œback homeâ€, this is my home too. This is my house. My father is buried here.
[cheers and applause]
You understand?
[applause]
[Mo sighs] So we went, for the first time I went to Burin, a little village short of Nablus, where my family is from. It was beautiful. I got to see my aunts. Amazing, cooking up feasts. This didnâ€™t get here by no accident. [laughs] Some home cooking. You know. Sitting there with my aunts and Iâ€™m looking out over the landscape, thinking about my ancestors, thinking about my father, thinking about my history. Iâ€™m like, â€œWow, I need to go to my grandparentâ€™s house, who are no longer with us.â€ I was like, â€œI have to go to my grandparentâ€™s house.â€ â€œI have to see where my mother was born.â€ â€œI have to see this, please take me over there.â€ So they take me over there. And I just sit and of course I had tears of joy and happiness. So much going on and we go to the rooftop. Iâ€™m like looking around. Iâ€™m like breathing in the air soaking it all up. Iâ€™m like, â€œAh.â€ And I see these walls. These walls everywhere and itâ€™s sad, but, you know. It is very sad and hopefully we can get past this at some fucking point. But Iâ€™m looking out into the village. Iâ€™m focused on the village. And I see this mosque in the middle of the village. And I look at my cousin, I was like, â€œHow long has that mosque been there?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œHundreds of years. Like itâ€™s been there for a hot minute, bro.â€ I was like, â€œI have to go pray there.â€ â€œI have to go pray there. Iâ€™m sure my father prayed there, my grandfather, my greatgrandfather. I have to go pray there.â€ He was like, â€œLetâ€™s go.â€ So we go. And I prayed there. I was meditating. I was like, â€œWow, what a beautiful thing, experiencing this. This is amazing.â€ And then these, like, five other guys were like, looked up at the clock and they were like, â€œHey, man, itâ€™s time for our Maghrib prayers.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhat?â€ He was like, â€œYeah, go do the call for prayer right now.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBro, Iâ€™m not gonna do the call for prayer. I just got here, bro.â€ [laughing] They were like, â€œBut you have the beard.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNot you too, bro.â€ â€œIâ€™m just fat. I donâ€™t want everybody to see the chin. You know what Iâ€™m saying?â€ Then heâ€™s like, â€œNo, you have to do the call for prayer.â€ â€œThe time is now and you have to do the call for prayer.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œBra, Iâ€™m not gonna do the call for prayer.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œYou have to do the call for prayer.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œYou donâ€™t know the call for prayer?â€ I was like, â€œYeah, of course I know the call for prayer.â€ â€œBut I had to go and speak into that microphone, a little tiny little microphone.â€ â€œFor the whole village, bro?â€ â€œI performed in front of thousands of people, but this is a lot of stress, bro. Scared to make mistakes.â€ â€œThere are religious implications to this situation.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œNo, you have to do it.â€ I was like, â€œOkay, Iâ€™ll do it!â€ And I walk up and I was like, â€œCousin, be next to me because Iâ€™m nervous. Make sure I donâ€™t mess up.â€ [sighs] So I do the call for prayer. Throughout the whole entire village. And Iâ€™m overcome. I was like, â€œOh, my God, this is amazing.â€ â€œWhat is this thing thatâ€™s been written for me?â€ â€œI canâ€™t believe this happened.â€ Right as Iâ€™m thinking this a man just crashes right into the mosque. [crash noise] â€œWho did the call for prayer?â€ Like this. And everybody sells me out. â€œThis guy. This guy did the call for prayer.â€ [laughing] â€œThis guy did the call for prayer.â€ I was like, â€œForget you all, man. You forced me to do the call for prayer!â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œWhy did you do it?â€ I was like, â€œI just told you they forced me to do the call for prayer.â€ He goes, â€œWell, you just did it ten minutes early, bro.â€ â€œYou did it ten minutes early.â€ I was like, â€œThat clock is flashing, man. Itâ€™s saying itâ€™s time.â€ He goes, â€œThat clock is ten minutes ahead.â€ I was like, â€œI didnâ€™t know that. Thatâ€™s a digital clock. Push the little buttons and it will fix the whole thing. Okay.â€ [laughing] â€œYou want me to do it?â€ And he goes, â€œWait, wait, wait, wait.â€ â€œIâ€™ve been in the village my entire life.â€ â€œI know everyone in the village.â€ â€œWho are you? Iâ€™ve never seen you before.â€ â€œWho was your father?â€ I tell him who my father is. He goes, â€œOh, my God.â€ He goes, â€œOh, my God.â€ â€œYour father is Mustafa?â€ I was like, â€œYes, my father is Mustafa.â€ He goes, â€œYou know who installed the sound system in this mosque?â€ â€œYour father did.â€
[applause]
It was truly one of the most beautiful things I have ever experienced in my life. And I had to tell you this story. Because just because Iâ€™m Palestinian and Iâ€™m forced to live where I am, itâ€™s not what it is. Houston is the city that raised me. And now Netflix is the label that pays me.
[loud cheering]
I love yâ€™all. Thank you so much, Houston, I love you guys.

Thank you.
[audience cheers]
Everybody have a seat, be comfortable, relax. I got to tell youâ€¦ letâ€™s go.
[audience cheers]
Thank you. I need you guys to know something. And Iâ€™m gonna tell you the truth, and donâ€™t get freaked out. This is going to be my last special for a minute.
[audience screams]
It is all good. Listen to me. I did it in Detroit for that reason.
[audience cheers]
Thatâ€™s right. You wanna know why? â€˜Cause I talked so much shit about Detroit in the first special I figured, I might as well, do the last special here. Sorry about that, by the way.
[audience laughs]
First of all, before I even start, Iâ€™m gonna say that â€œIâ€™m rich and famous.â€
[audience laughs]
And the only reason I say that is â€™cause the last 17 months were hell, and I cannot imagine what everybody went through. Well, Iâ€™m happy to see you and Iâ€™m happy youâ€™re well and I hope everyone you love is okay.
[audience cheers]
I donâ€™t want you to worry about me, Iâ€™mâ€¦ vaccinated, Iâ€¦ [audience laughs] got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
[audience laughs]
I got to admit, thatâ€™s probably the most n*ggaish decision Iâ€™ve made in a long time.
[applause]
I walk in to the doc like, â€œGive me the third best option.â€
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™ll have what the homeless people are having. So far, so good. And I know you probably heard on the news, I did get coronavirus. And it was something else. Like, okay first of all, when the doctor told me I had coronavirus I got to tell you, I was surprised how it made me feel. I felt dirty. [laughter] I felt gross. â€˜Cause Iâ€™ve been walking around Texas just touching door knobs and shit, hands all moist. Tipping n*ggas with cash. â€œHere, take this to your family.â€ [laughter] I must have killed thousands of people. Just trying to get tonightâ€™s show together so I hope you appreciate it â€™cause a lot of n*ggas died for me to get this one off.
[applause]
[cheering]
I hadnâ€™t felt that dirty in a long time. Last time I can remember, feeling dirty like that, man, I must have been a little boy. I was being molested by a preacher. [laughter] But donâ€™t feel bad for me, I liked it. [laughter] I used to get a kick out of cumming in that fellows face.
[audience laughs]
Well, he asked me to do it.
They make you quarantine. I had to quarantine for ten days at least. They said â€œYouâ€™re gonna have to stay in the room,â€ I didnâ€™t go nowhere. And it started making me nuts, â€™cause I would just sit in the room and watch videos all day. Now, do you know what I was watching? And I hate to say this, but there was a lot of videos sadly, of Black peopleâ€¦ beating up Asians for no reason. These attacks were unprovoked, I couldnâ€™t believe it. And I was sitting in the room watching this shit, it would stress me out. I was stressed already because the whole time when you get coronavirus, at least the first five days you wait, and see how sick youâ€™re gonna get. And it turns out, and this is trueâ€¦ I didnâ€™t get sick at all. [laughter] Not a cough, not a booger, not a fever, nothing. Look at me I am the Magic Johnson of coronavirus.
[audience cheers]
I just sat in the crib and got stronger all week. But I was stressed, â€™cause I kept watching these videos of my beloved Black people beating up my beloved Asian people, and being so cruel. And the whole time I watched those videos, this is fucked up but I couldnâ€™t help but feel likeâ€¦ When I saw these brothers beating these Asians up. Itâ€™s probably whatâ€™s happening inside of my body.
[laughter]
[audience cheers]
[applause]
I didnâ€™t get sick.
I also saw a lot of videos of UFOs. I mean, what the fuck has been going on with that shit? This n*ggas are here. These UFOs keep coming to Earth and it made me think of an idea for a movie. Sounds dumb, but hear me out. In my movie idea we find out that these aliens are originally from Earth. That they are from an ancient civilization that achieved interstellar travel and left the Earth thousands of years ago. Some other planet that they go to and things go terrible for them in the other planet so they come back to Earth and decide that they want to claim the Earth for their very own. It is a pretty good plotline, huh?
[audience] Yeah! I call it Space Jews. [laughter] Space Jews.
[man] We loved it!
Alright. Itâ€™s going to get worse than that, hang in there.
[laughter]
It is going to get way worse than that. Then I thought of an idea for a childrenâ€™s book. I actually wrote it. It is coming out soon. The book is designed to help parents, teach their children about racism which, if youâ€™re a parent you know is an impossible concept to teach to a child. But Iâ€™m doing it. The book is about a big, strong beautiful Black man with a benign, regular-ass White nameâ€¦ and he has a White speaking voice. So whenever this motherfucker calls to get a reservation at a restaurant, oh, he gets the reservation. [laughter] That name and that voice, who could resist him? Now I should tell you, this Black man is literally an actual giant. And he is a strong dude. And when he shows up to them restaurants they see that big giant Black dude they say â€œYou canâ€™t come in here.â€ And they call the police. And then every installment of the book the police come, and they always shoot him.
[audience laughs]
But remember, no, remember this guy is a giant, these bullets donâ€™t kill him, they donâ€™t even hurt him. They just break his heart. It is called Clifford, the Big Black N*gga, anyone?
[audience cheers]
This is my last special, because I have an objective tonight. I came here tonightâ€¦ because this body of work, that Iâ€™ve done on Netflix Iâ€™m going to complete. All the questions you might have had about all these jokes Iâ€™d said in the last few years I hope to answer tonight. And I would like to start by addressing the LBGTQ community, correct.
[audience cheers]
And I want every member of the community to know that Iâ€™ve come here tonight in peace. [laughter] And I hope to negotiate the release of DaBaby.
[laughter]
[audience cheers]
Sad story! DaBaby was the number one streaming artist until about a couple of weeks ago. Took a nasty spill onstage, and said someâ€¦ said some wild stuff about the LBGTQ community during a concert in Florida. Now you know, I go hard in the paint but even I saw that shit was like, â€œGod damn, DaBaby.â€ He pushed the button, didnâ€™t he? He pushed the button. Punched the LBGTQ community, right in the AIDS.
[laughter]
Canâ€™t do that. Canâ€™t do that. But I do believe and Iâ€™ll make this point later that the kid made a very egregious mistake. I will acknowledge that. But, you know a lot of the LBGTQ community doesnâ€™t know DaBabyâ€™s history, heâ€™s a wild guy. He once shot a n*ggaâ€¦ and killed him, in Walmart. Oh, this is true, Google it. DaBaby shot and killed a n*gga in Walmart in North Carolina. Nothing bad happened to his career.
[laughter]
[applause]
Do you see where I am going with this? In our country, you can shoot and kill a n*gga but you better not hurt a gay personâ€™s feelings. [laughter] And this is precisely the disparity I wish to discuss. I have a question for the audience and this is a real question, I am not joking around. Is it possible, that a gay person can be racist? [audience] Yes! Yeah!
Do you really think so?
[audience] Yeah! Of course it is possible. Look at Mike Pence.
[audience laughs] [applause]
I am guessing, but I bet you, he is gay.
Yeah.
[woman] Oh my God.
And he is not pride parade gay either, he is sad gay. I feel bad for him. He looks like one of them gays that prays about it. Jesus, please take these dirty feelings out of my heart. [laughter] Please Jesus, make these buttholes ugly to me. I donâ€™t want to keep on tasting these dicks. [laughter] Funny. You guys are confusing your emotions. You think I hate gay people and what youâ€™re really seeing is that Iâ€™m jealous of gay people. Iâ€™m jealous, Iâ€™m not the only Black person, that feels this way. We Blacks, we look at the gay community and we go â€œGod damn it! Look how well that movement is going.â€
[audience cheers]
â€œLook how well you are doing.â€
[applause]
And weâ€™ve been trapped in this predicament for hundreds of years. How the fuck are you making that kind of progress? I canâ€™t help but feel like if slaves had baby oil and booty shortsâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦we might have been free a hundred years sooner. You know what I mean? If Martin Luther King was like, â€œI want everybody to get up on them floats. Get your bodies good and shiny.â€ I donâ€™t hate gay people at all, I respect the shit out of you. Well, not all of you. I am not that fond of these newer gays. Too sensitive, too brittle. Those arenâ€™t the gays that I grew up with, I missed them old school gays, n*gga. Them Stonewall n*ggas, them the ones that I respect.
[audience cheers]
They didnâ€™t take shit from anybody, they fought for their freedom. I respect that shit, Iâ€™m not even gay and I want to be like a Stonewall n*gga. Them old school, gangster gays. Them glory hole n*ggas, them the ones I like.
[woman cheers]
These new gays donâ€™t even know what the glory hole is. Itâ€™s a hole in the wall, that gay contractors build. [audience laughs] You want to know why they put that hole in the wall? Iâ€™ll tell you, there is no nice way to say it. â€˜Cause when they want to have some fun they will put their penises in that hole and hope for the best. I respect that shit. Itâ€™s a lot of courage on both sides of that hole n*gga. [laughter] Iâ€™m not even gay and I want to try that glory hole out.
[audience laughs]
[applause]
What if Martin Luther King had to integrate the glory hole? â€œI donâ€™t care if it is Black lips back there or White lips back there a mouth is a mouth. A warm wet mouth.â€ Iâ€™m going all the way. I got into a fight. I almost got into a fight, it is complicated. I was in a bar in Austin, with my wife and it was during Covid, and a woman came to our table and she was maskless, and this bitch came over, no mask, all â€œHâ€ words. â€œHi, how are you?â€
[laughter]
Droplets was coming out of this bitchâ€™s face. We all covered our drinks. Ew! Baby, what are you doing? Now I looked over the table that she came from, and I peeped game. The men at the table were filming me. This happens when youâ€™re famous. People will come over and try to rattle your cage and get you to say something stupid or dumb so that their buddies can film it and get a video of you embarrassing yourself. And clearly I said, â€œThis is what is happening.â€ And these dumb motherfuckers thought, it was my first rodeo.
[laughter]
[applause]
Sadly it worked.
[audience laughs]
I ran right over there, I saidâ€¦ I pointed right in the camera I said, â€œYou is a bitch-ass n*gga for doing this to me.â€
[audience laughs]
And the dude was shocked that I said it. He said â€œHuh?â€ And when he did like this, Iâ€™ve seen all his fingernails is painted and I realized like, â€œOh-oh.â€ [laughter] â€œThis fellow is gay.â€ Yeah, you know how I talk. I call everybody a bitch-ass n*gga. You know what I mean? But that is not a right thing to do if theyâ€™re gay. You know what I mean? And now I was in trouble and not only that, the motherfucker was huge. He stood up, he was towering over me. He must have been 6â€² 5â€³, a big White corn-fed Texas homosexual, this n*gga was ready to fight. And he started barking on me, but I stood my ground, I wasnâ€™t scared. How could I be scared? This motherfuckerâ€™s shirt was tied up in a knot like this. Oh, fuck this guy. Letâ€™s go, n*gga, letâ€™s go. I thought we were going to come to blows. I was ready and then right when you think we would fight, guess what he did? He picked up his phone and he called the police. And this, this thing I am describing is a major issue that I have with that community. Gay people are minorities, until they need to be White again.
[laughter]
[applause]
Iâ€™m being very brutally honest, so we can solve this problem. Iâ€™m telling you right now a Black gay person would have never done that to me. â€˜Cause a Black gay person knows, when the police shows up theyâ€™re not going to care who called â€™em. They donâ€™t show up like, â€œWhich one of you n*ggers is Clifford?â€ [laughter] Weâ€™re all Clifford. This happens far too often. Another time, about six years ago, there was a lesbian woman that tried to sell a story about me to TMZ. Thank goodness, TMZ could see right through the sham of that story. This woman claimed that I beat her up in a night club because she was a lesbian. That is fuckinâ€™ crazy. Bitch, I didnâ€™t even know you was a woman.
[audience laughs]
Thank God! TMZ didnâ€™t believe that because I did beat the shit out of her, I am not gonna lie.
[audience laughs]
It was her fault, I had no choice. I came into the club minding my own business and a woman came up to me, and she goes â€œOh my God, Dave Chappelle.â€ And I was just being reciprocally nice. â€œHey, miss, how are you?â€ Blah, blah, blah. Benign talk, nothing to it. And all of a sudden this lesbian fellow stepped between us. â€œHey n*gga, thatâ€™s my girl!â€ I said, â€œYo, my man, back up.â€ Like that. She said, â€œI ainâ€™t backing up off shit, n*gga, thatâ€™s my girl!â€ I said, â€œBro, you gonna have to give me three feet, like this.â€ She said, â€œStop calling me a man, motherfucker.â€
I am a woman.â€
I said, â€œWhat?â€ [laughter] And then I looked deep in this n*ggaâ€™s cheek bones. And I said, â€œOh my God, you are a woman.â€ This is too much for me to even wrap my mind around but I tell you what, I un-balled my fist immediately and I softened my posture so that she would know, she is in no danger. I even changed the tone of my voice. I said softly, sweetly, like a pimp might say. [laughter] â€œBitch, Iâ€™m â€™bout to slap the shit out of you.â€
[cheers and applause]
I should have done it. Oh, I wish I didnâ€™t say that. She dropped that foot back, she was in a perfect southpaw stance. Her shoulders were angled correctly, her head movement was good, I said â€œOh, no! this bitch boxes for real.â€ She threw a wild hook at me and I saw it coming from yesterday, so I slipped it like thisâ€¦ I had no choice, I had to go to work. I let that jab go, you should have seen me go n*gga. I tenderized them titties like chicken cutlets. [laughter] I whooped the toxic masculinity out of that bitch.
[man cheers]
That is why I donâ€™t go out no more. Just trying to chill, Iâ€™m just trying to live a peaceful life. Thatâ€™s why I live in Ohio, you know, I live in a little town in Ohio. Must be like 3700 people, small hippie town. Culturally you might feel like, like Ann Arbor to you. [laughter] You know what I mean? Bunch of hippies and shit like that. And n*ggas always ask me like, â€œDave, why do you live in that hippie town?â€ And Iâ€™d be embarrassed to tell â€™em the truth. Well, you know why I live there? Because Yellow Springs, Ohio has the most beautiful women in the world. And a lot of people might disagree with me but, you got to see them for yourself, theyâ€™re gorgeous. But it all depends on what youâ€™re into. You know what I mean? I like White bitches with dirty feet.
[audience laughs]
If I had a strip club in Yellow Springs, I would have called that shit â€œStrippies.â€ All naked hippies, all the time. And I would only hire girls with long titties and long vagina head that looks like they slept on it. And I would keep a pile of dirt, right next to the stage. Iâ€™d come up like, â€œBitch get your feet in that dirt and get up there and give those people what they came to see.â€ â€œChalk up, bitch.â€ Couple of years ago I was in Ohio, at a shopping mall. An old White ladyâ€¦ This is true, she was following me around the mall. Which sounds paranoid, but Iâ€™m sure she was following me. Mean lady too. You ever see a woman with lines on her face? That just tell you likeâ€¦ even if sheâ€™s smiling, it would look like it would hurt the muscles in her face. I knew she was following me, â€™cause she was at places that had nothing to do with her Iâ€™d be looking around like, â€œWhat is this old bitch doing in Gamestop and Footlocker and all the places I like to go?â€ Every time I see her, sheâ€™d just be looking mean on me. And eventually I forgot about it. So, then after, I am shopping I go all the way to the back of the parking lot, Iâ€™m parked all the way in the back and as soon as I open my car door I hear a voice go, â€œDavid Chappelle.â€ Just like that. I didnâ€™t even have to look, I knew it was her. And I looked back and sure enough there she was, that face. To be honest with you, she probably wasnâ€™t even that old. Sheâ€™s probably around my age. But she was a White woman, this bitch looked terrible. [laughter] Iâ€™m going all the way. I kept my cool, I was nice. I said, â€œHello, miss.â€ And she didnâ€™t say anything back, all she said was â€œI watch your comedy.â€ I said â€œOh-oh.â€ And then she says, this is true, she goes, â€œSounds to meâ€¦ like you, hate women.â€ I said, â€œWell, you know what, miss? Itâ€™s art.â€ You are free to interpret this art however you like but I can tell you as the maker of this art that I donâ€™t believe that I feel that way. And she said, â€œWell, I thinkâ€¦â€ And I said, â€œShut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!â€
[laughter]
â€œBefore I kill you and put you in the trunk. Ainâ€™t nobody around here.â€
[audience cheers]
Iâ€™m just kidding, I didnâ€™t say that. I felt that way, but thatâ€™s not what I said. I was more clever than that. You know what I said? And this is exactly what I said, I said, â€œMiss, before you finish that statement, let me ask you a question. Where did you see me? Did you buy a ticket to a concert I did, I doubt that. Or, maybe you watched one of my specials on Netflix. Orâ€¦ Orâ€¦ Did I follow you to your car and do my act?â€ She said, â€œWhat?â€ I said, â€œKeep it in the comments section, bitch, this is real life, ta-ta.â€
[audience laughs]
[applause]
And then I drove off. And now I got to tell you and this is gonna surprise some people here, but not everybody. People say things to me all the time but what you donâ€™t know, is it does affect me. I think about it. And that one bothered me a lot, I was driving home, couldnâ€™t stop thinking about what this woman said because she is not the first woman that said that to me. Itâ€™s puzzling. You know what I mean? Like, what could I possibly be sayingâ€¦ that would make these bitches think, I hate women. [laughter] Couldnâ€™t figure it out. So, you know what I did? I Googled the dictionary definition of a feminist just to make sure, I was talking about the right thing. And do you know, sir, what the dictionary definition of a feminist is? I didnâ€™t either, listen to this. Websterâ€™s defines a feminist as a human being, not a woman, a human being, that believes in equal rights for women. I was shocked, â€™cause that is what that meant â€™cause by that definition I would consider myself a feminist, and I didnâ€™t even know that at the time.
[applause]
All these years, I thought it meant frumpy dyke.
[audience laughs]
Well, that seems always talking to be someâ€¦ chick in overalls, â€œMen are trying to rape us.â€ â€œAh, not you bitch, will you pleaseâ€¦â€
[audience laughs]
I know, look, listen, I support the feminist movement, I do in my own ways. Well, you guys did the womenâ€™s march, I tried to go and support you and none of my friends would go with me. I asked all the fellows, none of them wanted to go. I tried everything. â€œCome on yâ€™all, thereâ€™s gonna be bitches there.â€ They was like, â€œNope.â€ [laughter] So what I did is, I called my friend Anj. Anj is a Black woman who is a comedy writer and sheâ€™s dope. A matter of fact, a matter of fact, sheâ€™s the only woman, that I know personally that pays her ex-husband alimony. And she sounds just like a man when she does it. â€œFuck that broke motherfuckerâ€ and all that, she says all that shit.
[applause]
So I hit Anj up, I hit her on the text and all I did, I texted. I said, â€œAnj, are you going to the womenâ€™s march?â€ And she texted me back, and this is a real text, she saidâ€¦ she said, â€œI hope those White bitches get tear gassed.â€
[audience laughs]
There is a problem in that feminist movement, isnâ€™t there? From its inception in America there has always been a racial component. When Susan B. Anthony was having that meeting and Sojourner Truthâ€™s Black ass showed up. Read your history books. All the White women asked Sojourner Truth not to speak. They didnâ€™t conflate the issues of womenâ€™s rights and slavery. But you know how Black bitches are, so Sojourner Truth went up there anyway.
[laughter]
[applause and cheering]
She did a famous speech, she said â€œAinâ€™t I a woman?â€ â€œAinâ€™t I a woman?â€ Thatâ€™s right. And listen, listen, listen. I supported the â€œMe Tooâ€ movement, but the whole time, the whole time I thought that the way they handled it was stupid. [laughter] It was, it was White, it was likeâ€¦ they were doing shit, like going to the Golden Globes and all of them would be like â€œLetâ€™s all go to the Golden Globes and wear black dresses. And give these men a piece of our minds.â€ Bitch, that is not gonna work. You think Martin Luther King is gonna be like, â€œI want everybody to keep riding the bus, but wear matching outfits.â€ [laughter] You got to get off the bus and walk. Itâ€™s real talk. A real talk, that was a silly movement. â€œI want everybody to wear crochet pussy hats so they know we are serious.â€ What the fuck was yâ€™all doing? And then I said something about it in one of my specials and all these women actresses came after me. I said, â€œMan, fuck yâ€™all too, you canceled. I ainâ€™t jerking off to none of your pictures again.â€
[laughter]
[applause]
They were like, â€œWho is he to tell us anything?â€ Iâ€™ll tell you exactly who I am. Iâ€™m the one that got off the bus and left $50 million on the bus and walked.
[cheers and applause]
I agreed with these women. I just didnâ€™t agree with what they were doing about it. Right. Right. No, it was annoying as fuckâ€¦ because if these women were serious, you know what they would have done? They all would have fired their agents. And they would have went to the mailroom of one of these big agencies and found a woman that was bustinâ€™ her hump in there and said, â€œIf you want to talk to us then you have to talk to her.â€ And if they did that, then she would be big, and they would be big and nobody would get fed to Harvey Weinstein. But did they do that?
[audience] No!
No.
Was that their idea? No. Surprisingly it was mine. What I think, the feminist movement needs to be very successfulâ€¦ is a male leader.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™ll do it. I will. I will lead you women to the promised land. I will make sure you will get equal pay for equal work. I will make sure that nobody harasses you or fucks with you on the job. I will protect all of your interests. And all that I ask for in returnâ€¦ is that you suck my dick.
[audience laughs]
And now, weâ€™re right back to square one, arenâ€™t we? And now we get to the core of the crisis. Whatâ€¦ what is a woman? What is that, in this day and time? Is there even such a thing as a woman or a man or anything? Hmm. Hmm? Seems to be a question nowadays. Now listen, women get mad at me gay people get mad at me, lesbians get mad at me, but Iâ€™m gonna tell you right now, and this is trueâ€¦ these transgendersâ€¦ the n*ggas want me dead.
[laughter]
Iâ€™ve gone too far, Iâ€™ve said too much. But I got to tell you, Iâ€™m very worried about it. Iâ€™m not even joking with you. Every time I come out onstage, I be scared. I be lookinâ€™ around the crowd, searching. For knuckles and Adamâ€™s apples to see where the threats might be coming from. A n*gga came up to me on the street the other day. He said, â€œCareful, Dave, they after you.â€ I said, â€œWhat?â€ â€œOne they, or many theys?â€
[laughter]
Before I even say anything about that community you must know and I hope you all feel the same way I am not indifferent to the suffering of someone else. Thereâ€™s laws, the mean laws in our country. North Carolina passed a law once. They said a person in North Carolina must use the restroom that corresponds with the gender they were assigned on their birth certificate. No, no, no, no. No, that is not a good law. That is a mean law. No American should have to present a birth certificate to take a shit at Walmart, in Greensboro, North Carolina where DaBaby shot and killed a motherfucker.
[applause]
You have to ask yourself, if youâ€™re thinking about it, who are these laws designed to protect? Like letâ€™s say they designed this law to protect me, my interests, transphobic comedian, Dave Chappelle. Letâ€™s say Iâ€™m in Walmart, doing a little shopping with my family. Now I should tell you if that ever happens in real life, you should know my dreams didnâ€™t work out.
[laughter]
Well letâ€™s say something goes horribly wrong and there Iâ€™m in Walmart with the poor Whites rummaging around for mediocre goods and services.
[audience laughs]
And then I got to go to the restroom. So, I excuse myself from my family. I go to the menâ€™s room. Now Iâ€™m standing at the urinal, taking a leak. And this is what this law is gonna do. And suddenly a woman walks into the menâ€™s room. Iâ€™m like, thatâ€™s strange. And then she stands shoulder to shoulder with me at the urinal, Iâ€™m gonna be like, â€œBitch, whatâ€™s going on with you?â€
[laughter]
And then she hikes her skirt up and she pulls a real live, meaty dick out!
[laughter]
What do you think I am going to say? Thank God, sheâ€™s in here with me. At least now I know my family is safe. Mm-mm. No, Iâ€™m not gonna feel that way at all, Iâ€™m gonna feel very uncomfortable. I would feel better if it was a man with a vagina that backed up to the urinal next to me. [audience laughs] I wouldnâ€™t even think about that, Iâ€™d just be like, â€œThatâ€™s funny.â€
[audience laughs]
â€œThis guy is peeing out of his butt for some reason.â€ â€œOh my God, he must be a Veteran, thank you for your service.â€ Iâ€™m not indifferent to peopleâ€™s suffering â€™cause I know itâ€™s hard to be everybody. We Blacks, we just got our first big holiday in a long time. Happy belated Juneteenth to the Blacks.
[cheers and applause]
Juneteenth is a strange holiday, isnâ€™t it?
[audience] Yes.
It commemorates when Black people in Texarkana area of the country first found out that they were free. But remember, they were free when they found out. They just didnâ€™t know it yet. Very interesting holiday. You know, I learned something This is a wild story. I learned this past Juneteenth of a story, this is true. And itâ€™s that there was a Black man who was in South Carolina during slavery who somehow got granted his freedom by his so-called master. And when his master granted him the freedom he also gave him a plot of land. Now it turns out, this brother was brilliant. He had a good eye, good knack for farming. And he farmed this plot of land very successfully and made a lot of money, and this is where the story gets crazy. When he got all that moneyâ€¦ this n*gga brought some slaves.
[laughter]
Have you ever heard this before? This is a true story. Not only was he a slave owner, he became a slave breeder. And employed tactics that were so cruel even White slave owners were like, â€œYo, my man.â€
[laughter]
He was a wild dude, but he did it just because thatâ€™s what successful people did at the time. He just wanted to be down, what a fuckinâ€™ tragedy. How can a person that went through slavery perpetuate the same evil on a person that looks just like him. Itâ€™s mind blowing. And shockingly, theyâ€™re making a movie about him. Ironicallyâ€¦ it is called Space Jews.
[audience laughs]
[cheers]
Space Jews. [distant chuckling] The point of that story is this person was invested in a construct. That was the construct of successful people and he just followed the roadmap of successful people. He followed what they called â€œan incentive.â€ Now, everyone struggles but Iâ€™m very invested in the gender construct, personally. â€˜Cause Iâ€™m a man with kids, and a wife, and I like that warm, wet soft pussy that my wife has.
[applause]
This does not mean that I feel like another point of view canâ€™t exist. I was doing a night club in Oakland, 16 years ago and this was the first time that the trans community ever got mad at me that I knew about. And then I was nobody, I had just quit Chappelle Show. It was like a nothing hole in the wall club and I was doing some transgender jokes in Oakland, it was 16 years ago. My pronoun game was not as nice as it is today. I went too far, I said things like tranny and shit I didnâ€™t know these words were bad, and a woman stood up and just gave me the business. Started screaming at me, and Iâ€™m sure it was a woman. But she kept calling me transphobic and all this shit I had never even heard these words before, it was really weird. I didnâ€™t trip, I just gazed at Security to look like, â€œGo on, get that bitch out of here.â€
[audience laughs]
I kept it moving. And then she went to the press. The next day one of the gay papers wrote all of the same things she had said to me, about me in the paper. Misquoted the jokes, and was calling me transphobic you know, these words, I had never heard them before but every time that I talked with anybody from the community since they always repeat the talking points from that article. My least favorite of which being, I hate this phrase they say, â€œI was punching down on them.â€ â€œPunching downâ€, what the fuck does that mean? Now fast forward. It is 2019. And I am in a restaurant in Ohio, very nice restaurant. Itâ€™s Thanksgiving week. And to be honest, it is not a very nice restaurant, but it is a nice restaurant, if youâ€™re a White person from Ohio that has never been anywhere before. [laughter] Picture Chiliâ€™s.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™m sitting in the bar, Iâ€™m having a drink by myself and the only other person in the bar is a woman, a couple of stools down. And she was alone, and she was older, and that made me feel sad, â€™cause it was the holidays. So, I told the bartender, â€œSend that woman a drink on me.â€ Just trying to spread the cheer, and I wish I didnâ€™t. This woman wanted to talk. She wasnâ€™t mean, she was nice, but she just wanted to talk about shit that you know, I mean a n*gga just trying to get drunk donâ€™t want to hear about this bitch remodeling in her bathroom. And Iâ€™m sitting there, trying to be polite. Oh, subway tiles? Word. But then she hits a lick. Piqued my interest. She says, â€œMy daughter is coming home for the holidays.â€ Like, â€œOh, that is great news, Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re not going to be alone.â€ And then she goes on and on about how great her daughter is. I guess her daughter got a new agent and she is out in Hollywood, sheâ€™s in movies and on television and all this stuff and as sheâ€™s telling me this, Iâ€™m thinking, this woman is so sweet. She probably doesnâ€™t even know who I am. Or what I do for a living because I know what your daughterâ€™s is out in Hollywood doing.
[laughter]
And then she goes, â€œWould you like to see her picture?â€ â€œOh now I donâ€™t want to see this womanâ€™s picture, but what am I gonna do?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œOkay sure, Iâ€™d love to see the picture.â€ And I grab the picture and this is all I say, this is all I say, â€œOhâ€¦ she is very beautiful.â€ And as she puts the picture away sheâ€¦ looks mean all of a sudden, like she caught me in some kind of trap. â€œWhat did that face mean?â€ And then she goes, â€œSheâ€™s transgender.â€ And I think to myself, â€œOh, this bitch does know who I am.â€
[audience laughs]
I really resented that trap because that trap doesnâ€™t let me be honest. If I was honest, I wouldnâ€™t have fallen for it. Iâ€™d have just looked at the picture like, â€œLook at that big chiseled jawline, that big thick Joe Rogan neck. Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?â€ Canâ€™t say that shit. Itâ€™s really annoying. Fast forward, now itâ€™s a couple of days later. Itâ€™s the Wednesdayâ€¦ before the Thursday thatâ€™s Thanksgiving, and Iâ€™m in a totally different bar and this bar, trust me, is not a nice place. Itâ€™s foul, itâ€™s one of those bars where the top shelf should be under the sink. [laughter] This is where the poor Whites drink. The Tiki torch Whites. You know what I mean? Them White people, they believe in â€œQâ€ and they love Trump. You know what I mean? Like Michigan White people.
[audience cheers]
[applause]
I remember I was at this bar one time, it was that kind of bar it is. I was in there one time, I was fucked up and I turned around to everybody in the bar and go â€œHey everybody, I am going to buy everyone in the bar a round of drinks.â€ And all the motherfuckers was like, â€œHurrah!â€ And the bartender knew I was drunk, so she pulled me aside. â€œMr. Chappelle, are you sure about that?â€ Thatâ€™s going to be 16 dollars.
[laughter]
[applause]
Tough time for the Whites. And this was a holiday weekend. You know what I mean? These motherfuckers were having a rootinâ€™ tootinâ€™ time. They was in there partying, making all them noises. â€œOoh! Ow! Yeow!â€ You know all them noises White people make before lynching? They was doing all that shit. [audience laughs] I was drunk. I looked over my shoulder, I thought I was trippinâ€™. Guess who was in the bar? I thought I was seeing things, I looked across the room and I sawâ€¦ the trans-bitch from the picture. [laughter] I couldnâ€™t believe it. I said â€œWhat is a trans person, doing in a place like this? This is very dangerous behavior.â€ And she was with, two big, buff, gay Black dudes. I didnâ€™t know these dudes, but I know they was gay. If they had a dick in their mouth, they wouldnâ€™t look any gayer than they did just sitting there. [laughter] They had 1980s gay face. You know what that is? Remember in the â€™80s when gay people looked surprised all the time.
[audience laughs]
[applause]
â€œClose your mouth, n*gga, what is surprisingâ€, you know what I mean? But they was huge, they looked like Jussie Smollettâ€™s trainers.
[laughter]
And I am thinking, â€œMan these motherfuckers are in a lot of trouble.â€ So what I do is I stand up and everybody in the bar likes me, so I make a big show of it to make sure that everyone can hear me. Now, I walk right up to her, and I go â€œHey! I just met your mother the other night and she told me all the great things youâ€™re doing in Hollywood. And I cannot believe that someone from a podunk place like this can achieve all that, Iâ€™m so proud of you. Welcome home.â€ And the whole bar said â€œHurrah!â€ And I said â€œPhew.â€ â€œThat ought to buy her some time.â€ You know what I mean? A couple of more drinks and these fellows are gonna start asking her for some pussy, she might not have.
[laughter]
And she was very gracious. She said â€œThank you so muchâ€, and we shook hands and as she was shaking my hand, her face turned mean, like her momâ€™s. And she said, â€œDo you mind, not punching down on my people?â€ Oh, I donâ€™t like that. Normally, I wouldâ€™ve let it go, but I was drunk.
[laughter]
I said, â€œWhat might you mean, bitch?â€
[audience laughs]
I was careful to call her a bitch, â€™cause I didnâ€™t want to blow her cover. [audience laughs] Turns out she wasnâ€™t hiding. She was loud, she was proud. She let me have it in front of everybody. Screaming at me, all the talking points from that article. You transphobic, this and that. Kept clapping her hands in my face. â€œLet me tell you somethinâ€™.â€ I said, â€œWhere did you learn this from, Black bitches?â€ She kept going, â€œLet me tell you something, honey.â€ So annoying. She kept calling transgenders, her people. Ainâ€™t that weird? â€œMy people this, my people that.â€ I said, â€œWhat do you mean, your people?â€ Were you all kidnapped in Transylvanian, brought here as slaves? [laughter] She said, â€œMy people have struggled for decades, honey, decades.â€ And I looked at them gay Black dudes, like. â€œIs there anything you n*ggas need to tell this bitch? [laughter] Clifford, Clifford?â€
[audience laughs]
I am exaggerating, she is actually a very nice person and Iâ€™m cool with her now, but boy, that shit got on my nerves. And it got on my nerves because, whenever someone says that to me I know they have never seen me for themselves, they just repeat what theyâ€™ve heard. Any of you, who have ever watched me know that Iâ€™ve never had a problem with transgender people. If you listen to what Iâ€™m saying, clearly my problem has always been with White people.
[audience laughs]
[applause]
Iâ€™ve been arguing with the Whites my entire career. Just when I thought I had you guys on the ropes you changed all the rules. â€œOh yeah?â€ â€“ Yeah, motherfucker! â€“ â€œWell.â€ I am a girl now, n*gger. You must treat me as such.
[audience laughs]
â€œCall me a girl, n*gger.â€ Itâ€™s annoying as fuck. No, no, go back, go back tonight after the show, watch every special I did on Netflix. Listen to everything Iâ€™ve ever said about that community. Iâ€™ll go through â€™em. I said, â€œHow much do I have to participate in your self image?â€ I said, â€œYou shouldnâ€™t discuss this in front of Black people.â€ I said, â€œI know n*ggas in Brooklyn that wear high heels just to feel safe.â€ I asked you â€œWhy is it easier for Bruce Jenner to change his gender than it is for Cassius Clay to change his name?â€
[audience cheers]
[applause]
If you listen to what Iâ€™m saying, Iâ€™m not even talking about them, Iâ€™m talking about us and â€œthey donâ€™t listen.â€ Itâ€™s very annoying. And they have canceled people, more powerful than me. They canceled J.K. Rowling, my God. J.K. Rowling wrote all the Harry Potter books by herself. She sold so many books, the Bible worries about her.
[laughter]
And they canceled it because, she said in an interview and this is not exactly what she said, but effectually she said that gender was a fact. And then the trans community got mad as shit, they started calling her a TERF. I didnâ€™t even know, what the fuck that was. But I know that trans people make up words to win arguments. [laughter] So I looked it up. TERF is an acronym. It stands for Trans-exclusionary radical feminist. This is a real thing, this is a group of womenâ€¦ that hate transgender. They donâ€™t hate transgender women but they look at trans women the way we Blacks might look at Black face. It offends them like, â€œOh, this bitch is doing an impression of me.â€ [laughter] Now I shouldnâ€™t speak on this because Iâ€™m not a woman nor am I a trans. But as weâ€™ve establishedâ€¦ I am a feminist. [laughter] Thatâ€™s right.
[applause]
Iâ€™m team TERF. I agree. I agree, man. Gender is a fact. You have to look at it from a womanâ€™s perspective. Look at it like this, Caitlyn Jenner whom I have met, wonderful person. Caitlyn Jennerâ€¦ was voted, woman of the year. Her first year as a woman. Ainâ€™t that something? Beat every bitch in Detroit. Sheâ€™s better than all of you. [laughter] Never even had a period, ainâ€™t that something? [laughter] Iâ€™d be mad as shit if I was a woman. Iâ€™d be mad if I was me. If I was in the BET awards, sitting there and theyâ€™re like â€œAnd the winner for n*gger of the yearâ€¦ Eminem.â€ My man. [audience laughs] Gender is a fact, this is a fact. Every human being in this room, every human being on Earth had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on Earth. That is a fact. [laughter] Nowâ€¦ I am not saying that to say, that trans women arenâ€™t women. Iâ€™m just sayin, that those pussies that they gotâ€¦ You know what I mean?
[audience laughs]
[applause]
Iâ€™m not saying it is not pussy, but thatâ€™s like Beyond Pussy or Impossible Pussy. You know what I mean? It tastes like pussy but thatâ€™s not quite what it is, is it? Itâ€™s not blood, that is beet juice. [laughter] Oh buddy, Iâ€™m in trouble now.
[audience laughs]
Before I go, I want to share this story with you because it is important to this point. I want your community to know that one of the coolest people I ever met was a transgender woman. And this is not a man that I knew that became a woman, this woman was trans when I met her. Lived in San Francisco, Daphne Dwarman is the name. I would do 18 shows in the Bay Area sometimes in Oakland and Dirty Hood night club and she would be there, white trans woman, laughing loud and hard, at everything I said. Especially the trans jokes, very puzzlingâ€¦ because she was obviously trans. And one night after one of the shows I met her. And what it was, turns out it was her dream to be a comedian. And I was her hero. It was very moving. I could not dislike somebody that felt that way about me. We became fast friends. And when I made that special Sticks and Stones right as it was coming out, I happened to be in San Francisco and I wanted to do a show. But I needed an opening act, and I rememberedâ€¦ that trans woman I had met, so I called her on the phone. And I called her myself, I said, â€œHey Daphne, this is Dave Chappelle.â€ She couldnâ€™t believe it. And I go, â€œIâ€™m in San Francisco.â€ And then she started saying a bunch of wild stuff, I was like â€œRelax now, I donâ€™t want any pussy, I wasâ€¦ [laughter] Iâ€™m just calling, because Iâ€™m doing a show and I need an opening act. And I was wondering if youâ€™d open the show?â€ And she was like, â€œFuck, yeah.â€ Nowâ€¦ I didnâ€™t know this at the time but this woman had only done stand up comedy eight times in her life. This was little to no experience and now sheâ€™s about to open a show for what many call the GOAT.
[audience cheers]
[applause]
Sheâ€™s an amateur in stature, but in practice, she was very professional. She showed up early, which is something I appreciate â€™cause I like people to be on time. She was dressed to the motherfuckinâ€™ nines, I mean, Iâ€™m transphobic and even I was like, â€œYou look nice.â€
[laughter]
Went up on the stage with all the swag of a professional comedian, grabbed that mic and walked right down the middle and looked at the crowd like a gangster. Man, you should have seen her work. This bitch bombed for 45 minutes, straight.
[cheers]
And Iâ€™m not exaggerating, young man. That show was terrible. Stunk. Stunk. And then she brings me on, and you know, I was like a glass of water after a handful of salt. The crowd was happy to see me. I was killing it. But here is what impressed me. Any other comedian Iâ€™ve ever seen, if they had bombed as bad as she did, would have snuck out of the back of the theatre and went home and cried or something, but she didnâ€™t do that. Not only did she not leave, she found a seat, right up in front. You know, when a new comedian watches an experienced comedian in comedy we call this â€œtaking class.â€ And this bitch took my whole class, she sat up there and was laughing as hard as she always laughs as if nothing bad had even happened to her. And I saw her show. Something bad happened to her.
[audience laughs]
She was drunk. So she starts talking to me, while Iâ€™m onstage but the way a person would talk to a television when they were alone. She was talking to me like that. That didnâ€™t bother me â€™cause I knew her. But the crowd didnâ€™t like that shit at all â€™cause she sucked. And a guy in the back of the room stood up and Daphneâ€™s hair was dyed blonde at the time and the guy screamed out, and his energy felt wild as fuck. He said, â€œHey Daphne!â€ and everybody got clamped, they got tense. We didnâ€™t know who was a heckler or active shooter, andâ€¦ [laughter] â€¦he said, â€œDoes the carpet match the drapes?â€ It was fucked up. The whole crowd kind of groaned, â€™cause it was so like, mean. Everybody groaned, except for Daphne. She kind of laughed, which was weird. And she didnâ€™t even look all the way back. She said, â€œSir, I donâ€™t have carpets I have hardwood floors.â€ Just like that. [laughter] Just like that.
[applause]
Boy, when she said that shit, it blew the roof of the place. Cut through all the tension, with that one joke. She had made up for 45 minutes of a stinker of a show. And after that, she could do no wrong. And I kept on rocking, and she kept on talking to me. And then the show became something cooler than a show. It became like a conversation between a Black man and a White trans woman and we started getting to the bottom of shit. All of them questions that you think about that youâ€™d be afraid to ask, I was just asking them and she was answering them and her answers were funny as shit. The crowd was falling out of their chairs and at the end of the show, I go, â€œWell, Daphneâ€â€¦ I said â€œWell, that was fun.â€ I go, â€œI love you to death, but I have no fuckinâ€™ idea what youâ€™re talking about.â€ The whole crow laughed except for Daphne. Man, she looks at me like Iâ€™m not her friend anymore. Like Iâ€™m something bigger than me, like Iâ€™m the whole world in a guy. Then she said, â€œI donâ€™t need you to understand me.â€ I said, â€œWhat?â€ She said, â€œI just need you to believeâ€¦â€ Just like that she goes, â€œâ€¦that Iâ€™m having a human experience.â€ And when she said it the whole crowd kind of gasped. And I gave the Fight Club look. I said, â€œI believe you, bitch.â€
[laughter]
Because she didnâ€™t say anything about pronouns. She didnâ€™t say anything about me being in trouble. She said, â€œJust believe Iâ€™m a person and Iâ€™m going through it.â€ I know I believe you, because it takes one to know one.
[cheers and applause]
Then I told the crowd â€œGood night.â€ And they started going crazy and before the applause gets to itâ€™s crescendo I was saying, â€œDonâ€™t forget my opening act, Daphne.â€ And the crowd stood up. And I looked at her, tears came out of her eyes she couldnâ€™t believe it was happening. I couldnâ€™t believe it was happening â€™cause her show stunk. [laughter] And it was a great night. And I remember, the late great Paul Mooney was there bunch of flyers, comedy n*ggas was there.
[cheers]
[applause]
And we all went backstage and was just drinking and talking shit and laughing and Daphne stole the room, she had everyone cracking up. Spinning the yarn, telling us all these crazy stories about shit, sheâ€™d be into. We all laughing real hard, and there she is telling us and everyone is laughing. Iâ€™m looking around, Iâ€™m like, â€œOh my God, she is funny.â€ I pulled her aside, I said, â€œYouâ€™re hilarious. I didnâ€™t know that when you were onstage.â€ [laughter] I said, â€œYouâ€™re doing some things wrong but I can help you.â€ I said, â€œAnytime Iâ€™m in San Francisco why donâ€™t you open the show for me and Iâ€™ll just try to give you some pointers and see if you can work this thing out.â€ She said, â€œAre you serious?â€ I was like, â€œYeah.â€ And she grabbed me real tight, hugged me, squeezed me. And I pushed her off violently, â€™cause Iâ€™m transphobic. I said â€œBoundaries, bitch!â€
[audience laughs]
When Sticks and Stones came outâ€¦ a lot of people in the trans community were furious with me and apparently they dragged me on Twitter. I donâ€™t give a fuck, â€™cause Twitter is not a real place.
[audience laughs]
[cheers and applause]
And the hardest thing for a person to do is go against their tribe if they disagree with their tribe, but Daphne did that for me. She wrote a tweet that was very beautiful and what she said was and it is almost exactly what she said. She said, â€œPunching down on someone, requires you to think less of them and I know him, and he doesnâ€™t. He doesnâ€™t punch up, he doesnâ€™t punch down he punches lines, and he is a master at his craft.â€ Thatâ€™s what she said.
[audience cheers]
Beautiful tweet, beautiful friend, it took a lot of heart to defend me like that, and when she did that the trans community dragged that bitch all over Twitter. For days, they was going in on her, and she was holding her own â€™cause sheâ€™s funny. But six days after that wonderful night I described to you my friend Daphne killed herself. Oh yeah, this is a true story, my heart was broken. Yeah, it wasnâ€™t the jokes. I donâ€™t know if was them dragging or I donâ€™t know what was going on in her life but I bet dragging her didnâ€™t help. I was very angry at them, I was very angry at her. I felt like Daphne lied to me. She always said, she identified as a woman. And then one day she goes up to the roof of her building and jumps off and kills herself. Clearlyâ€¦ only a man would do some gangster shit like that. Hear me out. As hard as it is to hear a joke like that Iâ€™m telling you right now, Daphne would have loved that joke. That is why she was my friend.
[cheers and applause]
I was reading her obituary and I found out, she was survived by a daughter. And the moment I found that out, and this is true Anderson Cooper from CNN texted me. And all he says, itâ€™s very nice, he said, â€œIâ€™m sorry to hear about your friend.â€ And I texted him right back. â€œNew phone, who this?â€ [laughter] He said, â€œItâ€™s Anderson Cooper.â€ Oh, I said, â€œAnderson, look I need to find her family.â€ And he texted me right back with all the phone numbers and all this information. I say this to say, if you ever want to know about anything gay call Anderson Cooper from CNN. This n*gga is faster than Google. [laughter] What I did is, I got in touch with her family and I started a trust fund for her daughter â€™cause I know that is all she ever really cared about.
[applause]
And I donâ€™t know what the trans community did for her but I donâ€™t care, because I feel like she wasnâ€™t their tribe, she was mine. She was a comedian in her soul.
[applause]
The daughter is very young, but I hope to be alive when she turns 21 â€™cause Iâ€™m going to give her this money myself. And by then, by then, Iâ€™ll be ready to have the conversation that Iâ€™m not ready to have today. But Iâ€™ll tell that little girl, â€œYoung lady, I knew your fatherâ€¦ [audience laughs] â€¦and he was a wonderful woman.â€
[cheers]
[applause]
Empathy is not gay. Empathy is not Black. Empathy is bi-sexual. It must go both ways. It must go both ways.
[applause]
Remember, taking a manâ€™s livelihood is akin to killing him. Iâ€™m begging you, please do not abort DaBaby.
[laughter]
[applause]
Kevin Hart dreamt his entire life of hosting the Oscars and when he finally got the job they just took it! Itâ€™s not fair. They didnâ€™t kill him, Kevin is a strong guy. But Iâ€™m sure it broke old Cliffordâ€™s heart. Itâ€™s over. LBGTQ, L-M-N-O-P-Q-Y-Z, it is over. Iâ€™m not telling another joke about you until we are both sure, that we are laughing together. Iâ€™m telling you this is done. Iâ€™m done talking about it. All I ask from your community, with all humility will you please stop punching down on my people? Thank you very much and good night.
[audience cheers]
â™ª First I was afraid, I was petrified â™ª â™ª Kept thinking I could never live Without you by my side â™ª â™ª But then I spent so many nights â™ª â™ª Thinking how you did me wrong, and I grew strong â™ª â™ª And I learned how to get along â™ª â™ª And so youâ€™re back â™ª â™ª From outer space â™ª â™ª I just walked in to find you here â™ª â™ª With that sad look upon your face â™ª â™ª I should have changed that stupid lock â™ª â™ª I should have made you leave your key â™ª â™ª If I had known for just one second, Youâ€™d be back to bother me â™ª â™ª Go on now go â™ª â™ª Walk out the door â™ª â™ª Just turn around now â™ª â™ª Youâ€™re not welcome anymore â™ª â™ª Werenâ€™t you the one who tried to Hurt me with goodbye â™ª â™ª You think Iâ€™d crumble You think Iâ€™d lay down and die â™ª â™ª Oh no not I I will survive â™ª â™ª Oh as long as I know how to love I know Iâ€™ll be alive â™ª â™ª Iâ€™ve got all my life to live Iâ€™ve got all my love to give â™ª â™ª Iâ€™ll survive I will survive â™ª â™ª Hey hey â™ª

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage Kathleen Madigan.
[cheering]
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Wow.
Andâ€“
Another hand for the most overqualified opening act, Mr. Lewis Black.
[cheering]
And another hand for Jann Arden, who couldnâ€™t be here to sing that in real life but was nice enough to send that to me in the computer.
And a big hand for you people that are borderline alcoholics.
Youâ€™ve made it out tonight.
[cheering]
Youâ€™veâ€“
[cheering continues]
I do feel a kinship. This is a beer town.
Iâ€™m from a beer town. Iâ€™m actually from St. Louis, Missouri.
[cheering]
Thank you. You like that.
Specifically, Iâ€™m from very near Ferguson. Maybe you saw our travel brochure.
People are like, â€œReally? Are you really from there?â€
Yeah, I am.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œCan you believe all that happened?â€
Yeah, I can.
I canâ€™t believe we kept a lid on that shit for 25 years.
Every day I felt the tension. Every day.
Even In high school, I came home and I said, â€œI donâ€™t really know if our schoolâ€™s that safe anymore, Dad. A girl got stabbed to death in the third-floor bathroom.â€
He didnâ€™t stop doing the crossword puzzle.
He goes, â€œWell, donâ€™t use that bathroom. What are you, a goddamn idiot, Kathleen? Jesus Christ. Use your mind.â€
Itâ€™s not a very exciting state, Missouri.
Itâ€™s really just in the middleâ€“
Clearly, though, to Southerners itâ€™s not.
I was in Birmingham, Alabama.
I get done with the show, and this guy at the bar goes, â€œMaâ€™am, I could tell by the way you talk youâ€™re a Yankee.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œSir, Iâ€™m from Missouri.
And let me tell you this little piece of history.
I donâ€™t even know if we were in the war.
I think we were half and half and just beat the crap out of one another.
We never even left our own property, sir.â€
â€œFight Local.â€ That was our bumper sticker.
â€œFight Local.â€
â€™Cause we couldnâ€™t decide.
We were half Confederate and half Union. We still canâ€™t decide.
CNN had a map of the Syrian refugee crisis, a map of the United States, and who would take them and who wouldnâ€™t.
The South, yellow. No.
The Northeast said yes, weâ€™ll take â€™em. Blue.
For no reason explained till the very end of the show, Missouri was purple.
The only state.
And then at the end, they go, â€œOh, the purple signifies no decision.
They canâ€™t make up their minds.â€
Of course we canâ€™t make up our minds.
I donâ€™t really consider, umâ€“
I donâ€™t know what I consider. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s north or south.
But I know sometimes when Iâ€™m in the South, I see things on bumper stickers, I read things in their newspaper where I think to myself, seriously, I think we may need to have this Civil War again.
Iâ€™m not sure they got it.
I feel like itâ€™s beating up a drunk in an alley and then wake up and be like, â€œThat was bullshit.
I wasnâ€™t ready. Come back.â€
No. No, drunky. Weâ€™re not coming back.
I was in Louisiana, and you can google this.
â€™Cause I couldnâ€™t believe this was true. It is true.
They are teaching children in schools in Louisiana that will accept vouchers.
So thatâ€™s tax money.
Theyâ€™re private schools, but they accept vouchers.
This is in science class.
Now, put on your science hat and try to follow this syllogism.
Theyâ€™re teaching the kids that the Loch Ness Monster is real.
Now, as an aside, I agree with that.
But nobody taught me that.
I had to stay up really late watching the Discovery Channel, drinking a lot of wine and weeding through a lot of crap to make my decision.
Anyway, theyâ€™re teaching the children that the Loch Ness Monster is real.
Therefore, evolution is not real â€™cause the Loch Ness Monster is a dinosaur.
I donâ€™t even have a joke for that. I just want you to know that.
Those are fellow Americans that I think should be airlifted out. Iâ€“
Someone needs to get the children. Leave the adults.
Take the children.
My state is not a state that you really wanna brag about.
We just try to lay low. Thatâ€™s our best outcome: if weâ€™re not noticed.
Because every timeâ€“ Like Ferguson, that whole thing.
That was not exactly something that you feel proud of.
Uh, two summers ago, I turned on CNN somewhere on the road, and it said, â€œMissouri State Senate debatesâ€“â€
Now, you think the next word would be â€œhealth careâ€ or â€œright-to-work clause.â€
No. â€œNoodling.â€
Yeah. We spent two weeks, eight hours a day, the senate.
For those of you who donâ€™t know what noodling is, congratulations.
You have led a very classy life.
But Iâ€™m gonna tell you what it is.
Noodling is when hillbilly people get in muddy rivers, like the Mississippi or the Missouri River, and they get into water about chest high and then they go along the riverbank with their hands underneath the water searching for catfish breeding holes.
Then when they find one, they shove their arm in the hole.
They wait for the catfish to bite it.
Then they yank it out and theyâ€™ve caught a fish.
I was not aware that this is illegal in my home state of Missouri.
I was also not aware that it is legal in our neighboring state of Oklahoma.
I certainly was not aware that we have a Missouri Noodlers Association.
CNN sent a young reporter to interview the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association, who immediately became my new hero because for his interview on CNN, he chose not to wear a shirt.
[audience cheering]
She was clearly petrified of the guy.
I have never seen anyone hold a microphone further away from another human being.
She said, â€œSir, I understand youâ€™re the president of the Missouri Noodlers Association.
Could you please tell us your position on noodling?â€
He goes, â€œYeah. Yeah.
Iâ€™ll tell you my position.
If I wanna shove my arm in a hole and get a fish, you tell my why I canâ€™t.â€
So that was the argument for it.
Then I thought, what is the problem? I donâ€™t know.
Well, they go interview the people against it.
It was, like, basically an environmental group, and they go, â€œWell, our problem with it is two-fold.
Number one, every time they do this, theyâ€™re destroying the catfish breeding holes.
And number two, and more importantly, sometimes these catfish, especially if near a dam, can grow to be 150 to 250 pounds.â€
Yes. I swear. Google it.
â€œSo sometimes when the hillbilly shoves his arm in the hole, the hillbilly does not come back up.â€
But I was like, â€œYeah, but letâ€™s think that through.
What have we gained and what have we lost?â€
Everythingâ€“
[applause]
â€œWe might have lost Billy Bob, but somebody just got his brand-new truck full of Busch light.â€
What?
I donâ€™t expect people to know much about Missouri.
I do expect people to know itâ€™s a state. That I do.
And there are peopleâ€“
I was in California, in a Macyâ€™s, trying to buy jeans.
And the girl was young, Iâ€™ll give her that.
[imitating valley girl] She was one of the girls who talk like that, and she just couldnâ€™t be bothered with anything, okay?
[normal voice] I go to check out and I give her my credit card.
She goes, â€œIâ€™m gonna need to see your license.â€
I go, â€œOkay, thatâ€™s not a problem.â€
And Iâ€“
Iâ€™m still not sure exactly what happened. Iâ€™m gonna show you what happened.
I gave her my license, and she went, â€œMissouri.â€ [clicks teeth]
â€œUhâ€¦ no.â€
â€œNo? Did you just do a search in your brain and your hard drive came back with nothing, so you negated my whole state?â€
â€œUh, no.â€
Missouri is a very special place to one group of people, and itâ€™s the Mormons.
Not the ones that went to Utah.
Joseph Smith, the leader, had a son, Joseph Smith, Jr.
That man believed that the original Garden of Eden was 35 miles north of Kansas City.
Not in Mesopotamia.
No, no, no, no, no.
Missouri.
They also believe that when Christ comes back, thatâ€™s where heâ€™s going.
First stop, Kansas City.
Heâ€™s not gonna go to Bethlehem or Jerusalem.
Heâ€™s getting a Southwest flight and heâ€™s going straight to Kansas City.
Look, I am from Missouri.
And if you think Jesus is going back to Kansas City, 35 miles outside of it, by the way, then you must believe that Jesus is a big fan of barbecue and crystal meth, because that is whatâ€™s happening 35 miles outside of Kansas City.
My whole family lives there.
Well, my parents are in Florida in the winter right now.
As most Midwest old people with a car, they leave on December 26.
Theyâ€™re like geese. They just leave.
Flocks of â€™em leave from the Midwest.
My parents bought a new car. They havenâ€™t had a new car in ten years.
They bought a black Lincoln Town Car.
Little did they know that thatâ€™s one of the more expensive rides on the Uber app.
So I, unbeknownst to them, have signed them up to be Uber driversâ€¦ so they can pick up other old people on the way to Florida, make a little spending cash.
â€™Cause my mom will do whatever the phone says, Iâ€™m telling you.
â€œJack, we have to pull over. Weâ€™re the blue dot, and itâ€™s saying pull over. There are people that need a ride for some reason. I donâ€™t know why the phone is doing this. Itâ€™s never done this before. But Iâ€™m afraid if we donâ€™t, thereâ€™s gonna be a problem, Jack.â€
They go to Sarasota now, on that side.
But for about three years in a row, they went to a place called the Villages.
I donâ€™t know if any of youâ€™ve seen it advertised on TV.
Go to their Web site. Thereâ€™s nothing like it in the world.
Itâ€™s the largest retirement community in the nation.
Well, the world, probably.
Itâ€™s 35 minutes, or if my momâ€™s driving, eight and a half hours away from the Orlando airport.
Some guy thought of it.
He thought, â€œIâ€™m gonna buy all of this crappy swampland, and Iâ€™m gonna make nirvana for old people.
Iâ€™ll build it. They will come.â€ And they came.
Thereâ€™s 350,000 of â€™em.
They have their own zip code. They have their own post office.
Theyâ€™ve got golf courses, swimming pools.
I mean, itâ€™s really something. It really is something.
And my parents were there, and I go, â€œOh, good. Youâ€™re gonna be at the Villages. Thatâ€™s great, â€™cause I have shows in Florida, and I have nowhere to go in between shows.â€
My mom goes, â€œYou can come over here, but you canâ€™t spend the night on the property.â€
I said, â€œWhy not?â€
She goes, â€œThe law at the Villages, Kathleen, is no one under the age of 55 is allowed to spend the night on the property.â€
I said, â€œReally? Fifty-five? So youâ€™re telling me at age 48, Iâ€™m gonna have to again go get a fake IDâ€“
[audience laughing]
so that I can spend the night with you freaks. Mom, where would I even go? To, like, a bingo game and roll an old redheaded lady and go, â€˜Sorry. Iâ€™ll have this back in two days. I just need it to get into the Villages.â€™â€
I said, â€œMom, how are they gonna know if Iâ€™m there? Seriously. Does an old man come in a golf cart and do bed check every night?â€
She goes, â€œYes. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve heard. Yes. Thatâ€™s what I think happens.â€
I said, â€œWell, Iâ€™m going to come there and I am gonna spend the night. But I will meet you halfway so youâ€™re not nervous. Iâ€™m gonna sleep in my tennis shoes, sports bra and T-shirt and shorts. And if I hear the golf cart, Iâ€™m gonna get up, and Iâ€™m gonna run into the family room, and Iâ€™m gonna hide behind the La-Z-Boy. â€™Cause in my own mind, Mom, Iâ€™m gonna pretend like Iâ€™m in the last scene of The Sound of Music and weâ€™re the Von Trapps on top of the convent hiding behind tombstonesâ€¦ from the Nazis.
And then when the golf cart guy shines his flashlight, just for my own amusement, Iâ€™m gonna pop out from behind it and go, â€˜Donâ€™t do it, Ralph. Youâ€™re not one of them. Donâ€™t take us. Come with us.â€™ And then Iâ€™m gonna laugh and laugh. He wonâ€™t laugh, but I donâ€™t care. Itâ€™s not the point. Iâ€™m gonna laugh. And then Iâ€™m gonna run by him, Mom, and Iâ€™m gonna run away, and Iâ€™m gonna make it over the whole border of the Villages. Iâ€™m gonna make it to freedom, andâ€“
Do you know how I know Iâ€™m confident I can do that? Because Iâ€™m the only person out of 350,000 that has both of their real knees, Mom. I am the Usain Bolt of this community. I donâ€™t think youâ€™re respecting my powers.â€
Prepared to getting older, thereâ€™s moments where youâ€™re hanging out with them and youâ€™re like, â€œWow. Are you actually going crazy in front of me? Like, should I call someone? I donâ€™t know what to do.â€
I was in Target with my mom. She opened her wallet and all her credit cards were individually wrapped in tin foil. She unwraps one and hands it to me as if thatâ€™s a completely normal exchange of information. I go, â€œWeâ€™re not gonna talk about that?â€
She goes, â€œTalk about what, Kathleen?â€
I go, â€œThe tin foil, Mom. The tin foil.â€
She goes, â€œWell, obviously, you have not been keeping up with the news.â€
I said, â€œNo, I actually thought I had been.â€
â€œWell, then you must have missed the story about the raygun people.â€
â€œWho are the raygun people?â€
She said, â€œWell, your father and I saw it on â€˜20-40â€™ or â€˜60-80â€™ or â€˜100 Minutes,â€™ whatever those seriousâ€“ It was a very serious program. There are people now, Kathleen, with computer rayguns, and they can shoot that raygun through my purse, through my wallet, and they gather all of your personal information off of that strip on the back of your debit card. They can shoot through your fatherâ€™s ass at a gas station, right through his ass, into his wallet.â€
I went, â€œOkay.â€ My momâ€™s not stupid. She was a nurse for a million years. So I called my friend in Boston whoâ€™s been a cop forever, and I asked him about the raygun people and told him about the tin foil.
He said, â€œTwo things, Kathleen. Number one, no. I have not heard about the raygun people. But in fairness to your mom, I havenâ€™t checked my work e-mail in three days. Nowâ€“ Number two, and more importantly, what I do know from being a cop for 20 years is that crazy people love tin foil. You donâ€™t need to tell your mother. Iâ€™m just telling you so you know that is a fact. An old cop told me that. Always carry tin foil in your squad car. If you come across someone whoâ€™s mentally ill and having a psychotic break or maybe someone in a drug frenzy, you just tear off a piece of tin foil, you calmly walk over and go, â€˜Make a hat,â€™ and the whole situationâ€“â€
They drive to Florida â€™cause my mom wonâ€™t fly anymore. The fear of flying has literally gone over the edge with her. It started years ago.
And I do feel sorry for people who have that fear, â€™cause it is real.
And you see people at airports. You can always tell.
â€™Cause their hands, their palms are real sweaty. Theyâ€™ll talk to anyone.
God forbid the time of departure changes.
Then they completely unravel. Theyâ€™re like, â€œThis is it.
I think this planeâ€™s broken, and theyâ€™re gonna fly it. Donâ€™t you?â€
â€œYeah, I do. Today is the day.
American Airlines is gonna go, â€˜Fuck it. Give it a whirl. I donâ€™t care.â€™
Whaâ€“ Every part canâ€™t be that important.â€
But itâ€™s weird to me that strangersâ€“ There will always be a stranger who will say to another stranger, â€œOh, you shouldnâ€™t have a fear of flying, because Iâ€™ll tell you what, you have a better chance of being in a car crash than you do of being in a plane crash.â€
And I wanna say, but I wonâ€™t â€™cause it would be mean, â€œYeah, but you have a much better chance of getting in a forgettable car crash than you do of being in a forgettable plane crash.â€
Thereâ€™s no way youâ€™re gonna be in a plane crash, go to work on Monday, and then Wednesday look at somebody you work with
and go, â€œOh, shit, did I forget to tell you?
On the way home from Milwaukee, my plane crashed.
I donâ€™t know if you saw that on CNN. I was the lady running through the cornfield.
My hair had caught on fire because Iâ€™m near-sighted and Iâ€™d lost my glasses in the turbulence.
I actually ran towards the explosion versus away from the explosion.
Thatâ€™s why I called in sick yesterday â€™causeâ€¦ my head hurt â€™cause it had been on fire.â€
I fly every week, and Iâ€™ve never even thought about what if something happened to the plane until missing Malaysian Flight 370, which I am admittedly obsessed with.
My youngest brother, who I talk to almost every day, has banned me from speaking about it.
He goes, â€œSeriously, Kathleen, if you bring it up, Iâ€™m gonna hang up.
Itâ€™s been almost two years.
I donâ€™t wanna hear anything that youâ€™ve read on the Internet.
I donâ€™t wanna hear what you and your drunk friends decided happened to it.
Iâ€“â€
He goes, â€œYouâ€™ve never been obsessed with a plane crash.â€
â€œAh, ah, ah. What is the problem with that sentence, Pat?
You just said â€˜plane crash.â€™
We donâ€™t know if this plane crashed, do we?â€
Thatâ€™sâ€“ Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m obsessed with it.
About seven months ago, they found a wing of a Triple Seven in the Indian Ocean.
Thatâ€™s what that plane was, a Triple Seven.
And they sent that wing to the French.
I do not know why the French are in charge of science.
Iâ€™d have given it to the Germans. But whatever.
They actually came out and said, â€œWell, yeah, um, this definitely is the wing of a Triple Seven, but we cannot confirm itâ€™s missing Malaysian Flight 370.â€
â€œWell, has anyone else calledâ€¦ Lost and Foundâ€¦ looking for a wing?â€ They found another little piece, like, three days ago. But all it says is thatâ€“ It just says, â€œDo not step here.â€
So it could be that or a ladder.
Who knoâ€“ Nobodyâ€“ Nobody knows.
I watched every minute of the coverage, and my brother goes, â€œI donâ€™t get it.â€
I go, â€œBecause itâ€™s the biggest news story of our lifetime, Patrick.â€
Iâ€™m sorry.
Iâ€™ve assumed my entire life that when we bought a ticket in an airplane to go over a large body of water, I thought the whole time we were up here, someone smarter than us on the ground at all times knew where the fuck we were.
I did. I believed that.
Yeah, well, thatâ€™s certainly not the case. Cat is out of the bag.
They got nothing.
Boston to Dublin, Texas, when you get there, man.
It gets a little weird after Nova Scotia.
They donâ€™t tell people that.
As soon as you get a Guinness, give us a holler and let us know everythingâ€™s all right.
They covered it on CNN for 72 days, and people were complaining itâ€™s too much coverage.
Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, itâ€™s not. This is wonderful.â€
â€™Cause they have no new information, so now they just have to make up conversation.
It got to the point where the experts were, like, building paper airplanes, going, â€œOkay, hereâ€™s what I think happened, all right?
It was windy. Come on. Turn on the fan. Stay with me, Bob.
Somebody put water in the trash can. Thatâ€™s my ocean. Come on.â€
But I watched it, because every day they would go live to the city of Kuala Lumpur to a Hilton hotel for a press conference from the Malaysian Airlines spokesman.
I have never felt so sorry for any individual in their job.
Because every day he had no new information.
And he had to face a ballroom full of Chinese people.
â€™Cause there were 239 missing people. Most were Chinese.
Their families have been flown in. He couldnâ€™t even make eye contact.
He would just come out and go, â€œBrrrr. Ah, ha, yeah.
Well, uh, once again, I have new no information on Flight 370.
Itâ€™s a very bad situation.
We cannot find our airplane.
We have called Australia.
Theyâ€™re gonna help us look for our airplane.
Sometimes you lose something.
You canâ€™t find it, and you have to ask for help.
â€˜Hey, have you seen my keys?â€™
Thatâ€™s the kind of situation.
Sorry.â€
Then he would leave.
Iâ€™m like, â€œThis is a real airline. Theyâ€™re open. Today. I check every day. I google. This is a real working airline.â€
And the Chinese people were so kind, I thought. Like in patient.
He would come out day after day.
Thereâ€™s nothing. There was very little reaction.
Week three he came out.
â€œAh, brrrr. Ah, yeah, once again, I have no new information on flight. We still cannot find our airplane. Itâ€™s a really, really, really bad situation. We do know this now though. We have been looking in the wrong ocean. Ha ha!â€
What? What?
What? What?
â€œAh, yeah, that ocean wrong. Maybe now over here. Weâ€™re gonna look over here in this ocean.â€
What?
The wrong ocean?
That is an acceptable statement in the year 1492 regarding a boat.
â€œI donâ€™t know where it went, man. I told you the world was flat. Maybe it just fell off. I donâ€™t know.â€
That is not an acceptable statement in the year 2014. Unbelievable.
And once again, the Chinese people, they just didnâ€™t really react.
And I thought, â€œOh, my God. Thatâ€™sâ€“ Thatâ€™s the day where my Irish temperâ€“ Everyâ€“ Every single valve would have burst.â€
I couldâ€™ve had a can of Aqua Net and a lighter, and that man would have burst into a pillar of fire.
A biblical pillar of fire on CNN International.
And I wouldâ€™ve done it knowing full well Iâ€™m gonna be arrested and tried for murder, which wouldâ€™ve been fine.
And I would say, â€œYes, please let me take the witness stand.â€
â€™Cause I donâ€™t care what question Iâ€™m asked. I have a two-word answer.
â€œMiss Madigan, is it true that you took Aqua Net and a lighter into the ballroom?â€
â€œHuh. Wrong ocean. Ha!â€
â€œWrong ocean.â€
Unbelievable.
The Chinese people, though, are still pretty kind.
Day 72, for those of you who are not obsessed with missing airplanes, um, thatâ€™s the last day of hope because the ping device can no longer possibly operate.
Thereâ€™s the black box and then thereâ€™s a ping thing that emits a sonar sound.
Now, this is assuming one had put batteries in their ping device.
Yeah. Google this.
About five months ago, they had a little secret announcement â€™cause they thought everybody forgot.
â€œAh, yeah, one more thing. Ha ha. About that airplane. Um, we never had batteries in that. Yeah. Sorry. Well, you know, sometimes at home your remote control, your batteries go dead, and you go to a different remote control, and you take those batteries and you put â€™em in this remote control. And then later on, you go for the other old one. You go, â€˜Uh-oh. I forgot.â€™ Thatâ€™s what happened. Sorry.â€
They are open.
So day 72.
At the time the Chinese people donâ€™t know that thereâ€™sâ€“ They donâ€™t know thereâ€™s no batteries. They believe there were batteries in it.
He comes out, and I thought, â€œWhatever you do, just donâ€™t say it the same way. Phrase it differently.â€ No. No.
He came out, â€œBrrrr.
Ah, ha, yeah, once again, I have no new information on Flight 370.â€
And finally, the Chinese people lost their minds.
An old man, like, rolls back, flicked a lit cigarette at that manâ€™s head, live on TV.
Sadly, my first thought was, â€œWow. You can still smoke insideâ€¦ in a Hilton in Malaysia.â€
Note to self: Vacation in Kuala Lumpur.
Take different airline. Check Southwest. That airlineâ€™s ridiculous.
And then the older women started losing it.
Like, literally, having heart attacks. 911 is being called. Itâ€™s bedlam.
They have finally reached their maximum potential of patience.
Theyâ€™re out of it.
I happen to be home watching it with my parents.
My dad, who does not like public displays of emotion, was like, â€œOh, my God. Jesus Christ. They got to get it together. They got to get it together. Do they know theyâ€™re on television? Are they aware that people can see?â€
My mom interrupts withâ€“ And I have six siblings.
â€œWell, Jack, you have to understand itâ€™s extra sad for the Chinese people because they only have one child.â€
I go, â€œHold on a second. So are you saying, Mom, it would only be a seventh as sad if I went missing forever?â€
â€œYes, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m saying. Yes. You may not wanna hear that, but thatâ€™s the truth. I mean, we have six other children. They have children. Your father and I have casino buffet tickets. We are leading a full life.â€
Yes, you are.
Seven kids. Itâ€™s too many.
Nobody notices though. Thatâ€™s a good thing.
If youâ€™re one of seven, no one notices anything.
Like, Iâ€™m surprisedâ€“ I have friends who have one or two kids.
They speak to them about their feelings and their thoughts, and they address them individually.
â€™Cause my friends are like, â€œOh, you guys didnâ€™t?â€ â€œNo.â€
No. Not with seven kids.
There were just announcements made. Thatâ€™s all.
â€œWeâ€™re moving.â€ â€œOh, fuck. What? What? What? When?â€
â€œYour motherâ€™s already in the car. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on with you people.â€
Nobody notices when youâ€™re one of seven.
Which was fine with me. I didnâ€™t mind that. I would still choose that.
But sometimes to the point of, â€œReally, guys?â€
I do not watch myself on TV.
I was 35 years old, and I walked into my parentsâ€™ house, and they somehow had me on their TV, and I looked at it and I go, â€œAh. What is wrong with my eye?â€
My dad goes, â€œYou mean your lazy one?â€
â€œWhat?
What?â€ â€œYeah, your right eye.
When you get tired or nervous, it twitches and kind of jumps around.
Youâ€“ You donâ€™t feel that happening?â€
â€œNo. No, I didnâ€™t know. I didnâ€™t know that was happening. How long has that been going on?â€
â€œI mean, since you were a baby. I mean, they, uhâ€¦ told us to put a patch on you, but you canâ€™t have a baby girl pirate. Thatâ€™s crazy. So, uhâ€¦ we thought youâ€™d grow out of it, quite frankly, and clearly you have not, Kathleen. So if I were you, before you go on television, I would get a nap or calm down, â€™cause itâ€™sâ€“â€
I didnâ€™t really know how small families worked till I got to go over to other friendsâ€™ houses.
When youâ€™re in second grade or whatever, my friend across the street, Bob, he would say, â€œThatâ€™s my mom and thatâ€™s my sister.â€
And Iâ€™m like, â€œWell, where is everyone?â€ Like, I donâ€™t wanna say anything.
Maybe there was a house fire or, you know, some sort of tragedy.
But this is weird.
I think smaller families are kinder. They say kinder things.
I donâ€™t know if they mean them, but I heard â€œI love youâ€ a lot.
â€œI love you.â€ â€œlove you too.â€ â€œLove you more than yesterday.â€
â€œHa! Love you more than tomorrow.â€ And itâ€™s not even today.
I would just stand there paralyzed and uncomfortable.
â€œYou guys donâ€™t say â€˜I love youâ€™?â€ â€œNo.â€
There are nine people in my house.
Saying â€œI love youâ€ would be a sign of weakness.
They need to wake up and wonder how I feel about their ass.
Iâ€™m not giving them that.
And at this age if I walked into a room and all my siblings were sitting there and they started to say â€œI love you,â€ Iâ€™d run out because I would know this is some sort of intervention, and Iâ€™m not falling for that. Iâ€™m not listening to your dumb-ass sad letter.
â€œDear Kathleen.â€
We went to Catholic schools.
Uh, yeah, I didnâ€™t mind.
[man] Whoo!
If I had kids, I would make them go to a Catholic school, â€™cause Iâ€™ll tell you, the one thing I guarantee you, if you send your kids to a Catholic school, they will never join ISIS.
Somebody wouldâ€™ve said to me at age 18 after all that Catholicism, â€œHey, could we talk to you about our religion for a minute?â€
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
â€œNo, you may not. You are 18 years late to this party, Muhammad. Youâ€“â€
[Kathleen chuckling]
I think being Catholic is Christian, but itâ€™s been pointed out to me many times in the South that theyâ€™re not the same.
â€™Cause in the South, theyâ€™ll go, â€œOh, are you Christian?â€
Iâ€™ll go, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m Catholic.â€ â€œOh, well, weâ€™re Christian.â€
â€œOh, okay. I thought we said the same thing, but I guess not.â€
There are differences.
The Christians have a direct relationship with Jesus. They speak of it like that.
â€œYou know what? Me and my relationship with Jesus. I love Jesus. Jesus loves me.â€
Itâ€™s a direct, very solid relationship with Jesus.
And I thought, â€œWow. Really? You guys go straight to Jesus.â€
In a Catholic school, I was given a laundry list of people to contactâ€¦ before, the nuns said, because otherwise Iâ€™m bothering Jesus.
â€œYou are gonna call these people, Kathleen, before you bother Jesus. You could start with your guardian angel. Heâ€™s got nothing to do 24 hours a day except tend to your needs. If heâ€™s not available, you can speak to the saint in charge of the activity youâ€™re upset about. Every single saint has been assigned an assignment. You can speak to Jesusâ€™ mother if youâ€™d like to. You can give Mary a shout. But you are not to bother Jesus.â€
Okeydokey.
Even if I did something bad, I couldnâ€™t tell Jesus.
I had to go to confession.
I had to get in a creepy closet with a guy in the dark.
And then I had to tell him, and heâ€™s gonna tell a guy.
And I wasnâ€™t good at confession because my dad, for many years, was a defense attorney.
And starting in second grade, he would tell us all at the dinner table, â€œI want all of you kids to remember if the police capture you or anyone in a position of authority ask you questions, your response, no matter what, are â€˜I do not recall, I need an attorney. I do not recall, I need an attorney.â€™ Ninety percent of people are in prison because they canâ€™t keep their goddamn mouths shut. Never, ever snitch on yourself.â€
And then I would go to confession in the closet, and the priest would go, â€œKathleen, have you done anything bad?
Is there anything youâ€™d like to tell me about?â€
[Kathleen chuckles]
Iâ€™m not falling for this. My dadâ€™s probably planted him here.
I knowâ€“ I know what Iâ€™m supposed to say.
â€œIâ€™m sorry, Father, but I do not recall and I need an attorney.â€
â€œHoney, youâ€™re only in second grade.â€
â€œWell, maybe you donâ€™t know this, Father Anthony, but 90% of people are in prison because they canâ€™t keep their goddamn mouths shut. If youâ€™d like some more information on thatâ€“â€
If youâ€™re from a big family, you know you never say anything directly to the sibling that you intend on saying something till you say it to a different sibling.
Theyâ€™ll say it to another, and then eventually itâ€™ll get back to the sibling you intended it to say.
I, uhâ€“
This year at Christmas, my brother said, â€œYou should be on time because last year you were late.â€
And he said that our other sister said I ruined Christmas.
I go, â€œReally? Did she say that? I ruined it? Iâ€™m calling her.â€
I go, â€œDid you say I ruined Christmas?â€
[scoffs] â€œWell, I mightâ€™ve. I mean, you were late. Everybody knew to get there at 9:30. You didnâ€™t get there until 10:00. The kids were all excited. Everyone was excited. We had to wait â€™cause you had to stopâ€“â€
I go, â€œOkay, I agree. I was late. I apologize for that.
But I would like to point out for the future that I think you and I have very different definitions of what ruining Christmas would be.â€
To me, ruining Christmas would be if I wouldâ€™ve walked into Mom and Dadâ€™s house with a 12-gauge shotgun and shot them in the face. I think that ruins Christmas. It ruins the rest of the Christmases after that, â€™cause you canâ€™t ever have another Christmas without going,
â€œOh, my God. Remember that one Christmas when Kathleen went crazy and shot Mom and Dad in the face? It was horrible.â€
My siblings have tons of kids. Theyâ€™re everywhere.
I donâ€™t have any, and Iâ€™m glad I donâ€™t.
I donâ€™t have the pressure of naming the kids. Thatâ€™s awful.
My youngest brother, his name is John Patrick Madigan.
Thatâ€™s my dadâ€™s name, and that name has been in our family since 1853, circa Ireland, as far as we can count back.
And then my youngest brother knew that they were having a boy, and he called and said, â€œYou know what? Iâ€™m not gonna do it.â€
I go, â€œYouâ€™re not gonna name him John Patrick Madigan?â€
He goes, â€œNo.â€
I go, â€œWell, Iâ€™ve never asked you for anything, but I would like to know when and where youâ€™re going to be telling Dad this information, because Iâ€™m gonna bring a cooler of beer â€™cause thatâ€™s how long his answerâ€™s gonna be, Pat, and itâ€™s gonna involve the whole history of Ireland and whatâ€™s wrong with English people and they were actually potatoes, but they never gave â€™em to the people and Henry VIII. Whaâ€“ Whyâ€“ Why would you pick this fight? Your name is John Patrick Madigan. We call you Patrick. His is John Patrick Madigan. We call him Jack. Grandpa was John Patrick Madigan. We call himâ€“ You can call him Fuck Nut. Just name him. This is a crazy fight, in my mind. Donâ€™tâ€“ Youâ€™d have a better time telling Dad youâ€™re gonna become a woman. Seriously. â€™Cause Mom would smooth it over â€™cause youâ€™re the baby. Everyone in LAâ€™s doing it. Bruce Jenner. Cherâ€™s son.â€
I said, â€œWhy? Why, Patrick? Why?â€
He goes, â€œYou donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to live with somebody elseâ€™s name. Exact same name.â€
He goes, â€œYou know, I cannot get Direct TV because Dad wonâ€™t pay their bill.â€
What?
I go, â€œThey donâ€™t even have Direct TV.â€
â€œOh, no, not anymore. They did. Four years ago.â€
Thatâ€™s how long the standoffâ€™s been going on.
Itâ€™s over a movie that Dad claims he didnâ€™t rent.
Theyâ€™ve paid everything but that charge, but that charge has penalties.
So itâ€™s now $287.
And I said, â€œWell, just pay the bill. Iâ€™ll pay it.â€
He goes, â€œNo, I could pay it too. But I canâ€™t pay it â€™cause he wonâ€™t give me the account information. Because he doesnâ€™t wanna pay it.â€
I go, â€œWhat was the movie, just out of curiosity?â€
He goes, â€œLincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. And if you like to hear that speech, call him, Kathleen.â€
â€œWhy would I rent Abraham Lincoln? Has something new happened? Do we have new information? Did John Wilkes Booth not shoot Abraham Lincoln? I never ordered goddamn Lincoln . I know it.â€
I said, â€œAll right. Well, if youâ€™re not gonna do that, what other names were you guys thinking of?â€
He goes, â€œWell, a lot. But hereâ€™s a little left-field one. Maybe Seamus.â€ And I went, â€œSeamus Madigan?â€
He goes, â€œWhy is that funny to you?â€ I go, â€œI donâ€™t know. But we should pay attention to that.â€
I just laughed for no reason.
I go, â€œI think names have power. If youâ€™re gonna name him Seamus Madigan, I think you should lower all expectations.â€
Seamus Madigan is a bartender.
He always was a bartender. He will always be a bartender.
I donâ€™t think heâ€™s gonna be a heart surgeon.
And if he was, I wouldnâ€™t let him operate on me, even if he was my nephew.
If I was in some emergency room, they came out and said, â€œYour surgeon, Dr. Seamus Madigan, will be out in a minute,â€
I would be like, â€œNo, he will not.â€
And I would wheel my ass down to the Jewish hospital, where there was a nice young man named Sam whose family took education more seriously than beer pong and football.
Thatâ€™s what I would do.
I have no kids. I donâ€™tâ€“ I donâ€™t want them.
Iâ€™ve seen what itâ€™s done to some of my siblings.
Oh, theyâ€™re so tired and cranky.
My sisterâ€™s normally very happy. Has twins.
She looks so tired. I go, â€œYou look really tired.â€
â€œYou donâ€™t have to say that. I know I look tired. I am tired. I have four-year-olds. Did you knowâ€“ I thought it was gonna get easier. It doesnâ€™t. The average four-year-old asks 436 questions in a day. Did you know that? And I have two of â€™em. And Iâ€™m too tired to add 436 plus 436. Itâ€™s a lot of questions, Kathleen.â€
I said, â€œDo you know why they ask 436? â€™Cause you were dumb enough to answer the first question. Thatâ€™s what led to that line of questioning. You got to shut it down.â€
If I have â€™em, Iâ€™d throw â€™em in the van in the morning.
Theyâ€™ll ask a random question.
â€œHey, Aunt Kat, how come their dog gets to be out front and ours doesnâ€™t?â€
â€œFuck if I know.â€ Thatâ€™s the answer.
Ask Siri. Siri has answers.
Aunt Kat, no answers.
[Kathleen chuckles]
Hereâ€™s the biggest reason I would never wanna have a kid.
â€™Cause I will never again on my own or even assist on installing a car seat.
I donâ€™t know how many of you ever had to do this, but if youâ€™re gonna, hereâ€™s a few helpful hints.
Take the whole day off work, because thatâ€™s how long itâ€™s gonna take you.
Whatever your favorite alcohol is, have a bucket of it next to that minivan, â€™cause youâ€™re gonna stop and have to take drinks and re-read things.
If youâ€™re over the age of, oh, Iâ€™d say 30, at some point youâ€™re going to become infuriated with Ralph Nader, â€™cause heâ€™s the one who started it all.
I remember being in grade school and he was on 60 Minutes .
â€œSeat belts. Everybody must have a seat belt. Car seat, seat belts, safety is for life. Head injuries are also for life. I have statistics.â€
Well, maybe you do, Ralph.
Iâ€™m sure you do. But so do I. There were seven of us, Ralph.
For 16 years, we rode around in the back of a station wagon completely untethered.
Completely.
And we were in accidents. A lot of them. Especially if my mom was driving.
Weâ€“ Sometimes we got hit so hard, I actually flew to a better seat than Iâ€™d originally secured.
â€œWhoâ€™s got the window now, jackass?â€
Thatâ€™s right.
And that was with my parents chain-smoking in the car. Both of â€™em.
It was so smoky in that car.
You could barely see other passengers. Seriously.
They way, way back was like Studio 54, because the sun would hit the smoke and create patterns, and then I would draw patterns within the pattern because I didnâ€™t have an iPad, so thatâ€™s what I would do to entertain myself.
If youâ€™re a woman and youâ€™re gonna install a car seat, I would highly suggest you put on a sports bra, â€™cause youâ€™re gonna get hot.
Youâ€™re gonna be so hot, youâ€™re gonna start inadvertently just tearing off pieces of clothing.
And if youâ€™re not careful, youâ€™ll end up like I did, in my sisterâ€™s driveway in my regular bra just drinking a beer, staring off into space.
And the normally, very friendly neighbors came home. Iâ€™m trying to talk to â€™em.
I donâ€™t know why theyâ€™re being so weird.
And Iâ€™m like, â€œHow you guys doing? Yeah, I know. I just came home. She had twins. I need two of these. I canâ€™tâ€“ canâ€™t figure it out. Iâ€™m so hot. Iâ€™m so hot. I would offer you a beer, but I only have three left. And Iâ€™ve made no progress.â€
Soâ€“
I just found notes on the backâ€“
Thereâ€™s factory notes that say if you donâ€™t know how to do this, you can take it to the police or the fire department and theyâ€™ll install it for you.
But unfortunately, I didnâ€™t find those notes till after I already started drinking.
So I donâ€™t think it would be a good idea to drive to law enforcement, shit-faced, and two car seats and I donâ€™t have any babies.
I mean, Itâ€™s just too much to explain, right?
Crazy.
So this was what I was thinking.
I was thinking I might set her car on fire.
No, call the fire department, and then after they put the car out, I go, â€œHey, since youâ€™re all here, do you think you can give me a hook-up?â€
[man] Yeah!
[chuckles]
Theyâ€™re a pain in the ass, to put kids in them, especially in winter with the coats and 70,000 buckles and the whole thing.
And my brotherâ€™s kid I thought was big enough to not go in a car seat, and I said, â€œDo I do him too?â€
Sheâ€™s just disgusted with my lack of any parenting knowledge.
She goes, â€œUgh. 4-foot-10, 80 pounds.â€
What?
â€œThatâ€™s a Missouri state law, Kathleen. If youâ€™re 4-foot-10 or shorter, 80 pounds or less, your ass is in a car seat versus a ticket from the Missouri State Highway Patrol.â€
I go, â€œReally, 4â€™10â€?
That is excellent news because right now Iâ€™m only 5-foot-1.
The average woman, due to osteoporosisâ€¦ in your life, you would have shrunk anywhere from two to five inches.
I am not certain. I am bad at math.
But Iâ€™m pretty sure that puts me back in a car seat.
I canâ€™t wait to be back in a car seat.
All these nieces and nephews I have will be old enough to drive.
Iâ€™m gonna do exactly what they do. Iâ€™ll call and say I need a ride.
Then Iâ€™m gonna pack a big bag full of unnecessary, unrelated items that I have to have, or there is going to be a meltdown.
Then, like the five and six-year-olds, Iâ€™m gonna get in the van and walk, on my own accord, to the very backseat, and Iâ€™m just gonna hop up in it like they do and wait for the great buckling.
Just sit there.
[mouthing words]
Then Iâ€™m gonna let â€™em buckle me in. Then Iâ€™m gonna let them pull away.
And Iâ€™m gonna wait till they drive where itâ€™s somewhere terribly inconvenient to pull over.
And Iâ€™m gonna start screaming from the back like they do.
â€œMy buckleâ€™s too tight!â€
[gasping]
â€œIâ€™m choking!â€
[gasping]
[chuckles]
â€œI dropped my wine.â€
[gasping]
â€œI canâ€™t reach my wine.â€
[chuckling]
Thatâ€™s what I want to do when Iâ€™m retired.
I just want to drink red wine and watch House Hunters over and over.
I love that show. I do.
I donâ€™t know why. I donâ€™t even care what houses these people are buying.
Iâ€™m more interested in their relationships because at least 50 percent of the people shouldnâ€™t even be married, more or less purchasing property together.
I saw one in Atlanta.
It was a man and a woman. They walked into the house.
And the first thing out of the manâ€™s mouth, he goes, â€œAh! I canâ€™t live with this backsplash.â€
Oh, my God, maâ€™am.
You have a much bigger problem than what house youâ€™re gonna buy.
You have accidentally married a gay guy.
And his boyfriend is not gonna approve of this ugly backsplash when he comes over here while youâ€™re at yoga, aka drinking with your girlfriends on a Thursday.
Iâ€™m just amazed to, likeâ€“
In my whole life Iâ€™ve never punched anybody, but if I was the Realtors on this show, I would punch at least half of these peopleâ€“ my own clients right in the face.
They are so demanding, and they naysay a house right out of the gate.
They just walk in and go, â€œPah! I canâ€™t live here. Thereâ€™s no granite countertops.â€
Iâ€™m sorry. Maybe you forgot. You have a budget of $8.00.
Maybeâ€¦ you should be grateful that Iâ€™m not showing you a mobile home right now and bragging about the porch that JoJo put on before he went back to prison.
What in Christâ€™s name would make you think you can have granite countertops?
And itâ€™s always the meanest lady of any episode who at some point would go, â€œI donâ€™t know if I want to live here. I donâ€™t see any room for entertaining.â€
Well, donâ€™t worry, maâ€™am. No oneâ€™s fucking coming over here.
Youâ€™re the meanest person Iâ€™ve ever heard speak English on television.
Seriously.
But I think over the age of 40, if thatâ€™s what I wanna do with my timeâ€“
Over 40 you can kind of give up.
If I just want to drink wine, why not?
The dream catcher didnâ€™t catch anything.
Itâ€™s the third quarter. Iâ€™m losing.
Justâ€“ I do understandâ€“ Over 40â€“ I donâ€™t understand young people that kind of give up so early where you can tell theyâ€™re just disgusted.
They donâ€™t want any more information. They have just had it.
Early, like in their 20s.
I flew to Norfolk, Virginia. Iâ€™ve never been there.
I got off the plane. And their airport was themed.
Iâ€™ve never seen that. And the theme they chose was mermaids.
They were everywhere.
They were, like, in the carpet, in baggage claim.
Theyâ€™re handing you the luggage.
Theyâ€™re just everywhere.
And I went to the gift shop on the way out because I wanted to get water.
Thereâ€™s a girl working in the gift shop. Sheâ€™s about 25 years old.
I said, â€œHey, Iâ€™m not from here. Whatâ€™s going on with all this mermaid stuff?â€
And she said, and I quote, [raspy voice] â€œI donâ€™t know. Somebody saw one once.â€
Wow. Wow. I thought, she truly doesnâ€™t give a shit.
Sheâ€“ Bigfoot couldâ€™ve been shopping in that gift shop.
Sheâ€™d be like, â€œI donâ€™t know what your hairy ass is planning on buying, but I close in five minutes, all right? I ainâ€™t scared of you, Mr. Monster Man.â€
â€œI donâ€™t know. Somebody saw one once.â€
Just so disgusted that I even asked.
But then after meeting the mermaid lady, for, like, the next three months no matter what question I was asked, thatâ€™s the only answer I would give.
Iâ€™ll just go, â€œI donâ€™t know. Somebody saw one once.â€
Because it is so confusing and dismissive to the recipient, but itâ€™s so fun if youâ€™re the one saying it.
Myâ€“ My youngest brother, the one who wonâ€™t let me speak about Malaysian Flight 370, he helps me with my taxes â€™cause if Iâ€“
Any state you work in you have to fill out their forms even if you donâ€™t get money back.
He called about six weeks after Iâ€™ve met the mermaid lady, and he goes, â€œYeah, Kathleen, Iâ€™m trying to do your taxes.
Iâ€™m trying to get all these states. I think you worked in Wisconsin two times.
You should getâ€“ They have a state-withholding tax.
Youâ€™ll be able to get a refund. Itâ€™s a 3.8 percent.
Ah, da, da. When you got paid, you shouldâ€™ve been given some forms.
Do you know where those forms are?â€
â€œI donâ€™t know. Somebody saw one once.â€
And I guarantee you, if you say that, the only thing a person will ever say back is, â€œWhat?â€
And thenâ€“ [mouthing words]
Thatâ€™s what I wanna do. I wanna drink red wine and watch House Hunters .
Uh, I donâ€™t usually think I drink too much until you go to the doctor and they have those drinking questions on there.
Yeah.
Mine, itâ€™s seven and eight.
Question 7: Do you drink alcohol? A little tiny box says, â€œYes.â€
Question 8: Do you drink two, four, six or eight drinks a week?
â€œNo.â€ [laughs]
No.
You are not even in the right ballpark. Jesus Christ.
What is this, a Mormon practice?
I thought the name said â€œFitzgerald.â€
And I would not be judged on my deviant and abhorring drinking behavior.
See other side, parenthesis, arrow.
No.
If I do feel bad about my drinking, I would come here.
â€™Cause you guys set a whole new bar.
[audience cheering]
Uh, or I go to Ireland.
I try to go once a year to be with my people.
To reset my priorities and my boundaries.
I have friends that go to Hawaii every year.
Theyâ€™re like, â€œWe love Hawaii, but you seem to really love Ireland.
Do you think we would like it? Do you think theyâ€™re similar?â€
Oh. [scoffs]
Well, theyâ€™re both an island.
Um, Ireland, however, would have no vegetables or sun.
I donâ€™t know if those two things interest you, but they are fresh out.
It is not a healthy place.
Thatâ€™s why I feel at home there, and thatâ€™s why I like it there.
Itâ€™s sort of the gist. They just donâ€™t really, truly give a shit.
On a good level, in a healthy way, theyâ€™ve decided to not be healthy.
I was in a pub. I ordered roast beef with mashed potatoes, â€™cause I love that, and I thought, Iâ€™m going to ask, probably the answer is no, but Iâ€“
The guy was like 80, the bartender.
And I go, â€œHey, do you guys, by any chance, have any corn?â€
You wouldâ€™ve thought I asked for an eight-ball of cocaine.
Iâ€“
He goes, â€œCorn?â€
[Irish accent] â€œNo, we wouldnâ€™t have any corn here in the countryside. We probably donâ€™t have any corn in the entire country at the moment.â€
I said, â€œHave you ever had corn?â€
â€œYes. Iâ€™ve had corn. When I was nine, we traveled to Germany. And I had some corn and I didnâ€™t care for it.â€
I was like, â€œGood for you.â€ He hasnâ€™t had corn in 71 years. And he doesnâ€™t give a shit. And he looks fine. And heâ€™s bartending on a Thursday.
The whole pace of Ireland is just slower. But I like it better.
It just takes you a while in your American mind to slow down like that.
I wentâ€“ â€™Cause they donâ€™tâ€“
Itâ€™s veryâ€“ Nobodyâ€™s really, you know, fired up on it.
I went in a store that said â€œbagels,â€ in a little town in the country.
I walked in. Thereâ€™s a lady.
And thereâ€™s a glass case, and thereâ€™s no bagels.
And I thought, here we go. Right?
I go, â€œYou donâ€™t have anyâ€“â€
I thought maybe they were in the back. â€œYou donâ€™t have any bagels?â€
â€œNo, Iâ€™m afraid we wouldnâ€™t have any bagels at the moment.â€
â€œAre you selling any other food right now?â€
â€œNo. I wouldnâ€™t be selling anything but the bagels, and I donâ€™t have at the moment.â€
Itâ€™s at that point your American brain wants to go, â€œWhat the fuck is wrong with you people?â€
But I would never do that â€™cause Iâ€™m Midwest polite.
Iâ€“ I said, â€œUh, whatâ€“ Can I ask you a question? Why are you still open? â€™Cause you have nothing for sale.â€
She goes, â€œI left the door open. First of all, I donâ€™t know where the bagels are. Theyâ€™re supposed to be here half past 7:00. Itâ€™s half past 10:00. I donâ€™t know. Perhaps thereâ€™s been an accident on the road. Youâ€™ll say a rosary or perhaps a novena tonight for Johnny the bagel man. I left the door open in case I had a nice conversation with someone like yourself.â€
Oh, my God. I have to now go back to the other bar and order a Guinness in order to fix this conversation in my brain.
I love Guinness. That is actually my favorite thing in the whole world.
Itâ€™s the greatest drink.
Itâ€™s like somebody had a beer, and then somebody threw a roast beef in the beer, and then somebody put mashed potatoes on top and handed it to you.
[man] Whoo!
Itâ€™s not healthy. But I really donâ€™t care about health either.
There comes a point in your life where youâ€™re like, â€œI think itâ€™s too late.â€
Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t like to watch CNN because Sanjay Gupta, that doctor, comes on, and he is a buzzkill.
Every single time heâ€™s on, heâ€™s got bad news about things that can kill us.
But itâ€™s things weâ€™ve been doing our whole lives.
Iâ€™m like, â€œSanjay, people watching CNN are most likely over the age of 30. It is too late for us. You, sir, should be on Nickelodeon. Tell the children. Save the children.â€
Itâ€™s too late.
I was watching it about two weeks before Thanksgiving.
He came on. Heâ€™s like, â€œUh-oh. Oh, God.
Horrible news. Uh, World Health Organization just did a study.
And as it turns out, they have decided that processed meats are raising the cancer rates by a much higher rate, specifically bacon.â€
[audience jeering]
Yeah.
Yeah, well, thatâ€™s right, Wisconsin.
Thatâ€™sâ€“ [chuckles] Whoa.
Iâ€™m like, bacon?
Iâ€™m sorry to hear that, Sanjay.
â€™Cause I love bacon. Iâ€™ve been eating it my whole life.
Sometimes I put it in Bloody Marys. Iâ€™ve actually drank bacon.
Thatâ€™s how muchâ€“
I added it up.
In my life, give or take ten, I have eaten 311 pigs.
Iâ€“ Iâ€™ve eaten a farm, sir.
You canâ€™t fix that with a yoga class.
You canâ€™t back that damage up with a walk around the block.
And I donâ€™t even go looking for health stuff.
Iâ€™m not that person whereâ€“ No. Like the front page of Yahoo.
I donâ€™t know. Six months ago it said, â€œIf youâ€™re fair skin with freckles, uh, click here.â€
Why, I donâ€™t want to click it.
You know itâ€™s not good news.
Theyâ€™re not gonna go, â€œHey, guess what, freckle people. Yâ€™all won $50. Run on down to the post office and pick up your government check.â€
No.
But I feel like I have to click on it, â€™cause itâ€™s a meeting of my people.
What if thereâ€™s an announcement and I donâ€™t hear it, and Iâ€™m the only lady that didnâ€™t know.
Look like some sort of jackass.
So I clicked on it.
Google this. Itâ€™s unbelievable.
They go, â€œUh-oh. Pah, just found this out.â€
Incoming. Breaking news.
If youâ€™re white with freckles, fair skin, and youâ€™ve been drinking orange juiceâ€“
All of us, our whole livesâ€“ or eating grapefruit, they have figured out that when you go outside in the sun, because your skinâ€“
Itâ€™s so easy to penetrate your skin, that the sun is activating the acid from the grapefruits and the oranges, raising your chances of melanoma by, like, 27 percent.
Yeah. So now, I canâ€™t go outside to exercise in the sunshine.
Or I will become activated which forces me back into the dark barâ€¦ where I can have a Bloody Mary with some bacon in it.
[applause]
[man] yeah!
And I said to my sister, â€œI wouldâ€“ I would exercise more.
But all I do is fly around. Iâ€™m just sitting in an airport.â€
She goes, â€œYou should get a Fitbit.â€ This is what this is on my arm.
It would work better if I charged it properly.
But this counts your steps and your miles.
And itâ€™ll have your heart rate if you want to enter your food.
Itâ€™s like thisâ€“ I go, â€œWell, maybe Iâ€™ll do that. Maybe Iâ€™ll get addicted to seeing how many steps I get in a day.â€
So, from my iPad, on my couch, I ordered the Fitbit from Amazon.
I paid the extra money to have it overnighted.
So the following day, this was on my porch on my front steps, which I now know is six and a half steps away from my couch.
And then I opened it up, and I googled it, â€™cause I wanted to know how it work.
Really? It can count how far Iâ€™ve walked, steps and speed.
We canâ€™t find Flight 370, but Iâ€™m not supposed to talk about that.
Supposed to just let that go.
But we have this technology.
So I googled, â€œHow does it work?â€
It works based on this motion from when youâ€™re walking.
And then, my Irish jackasses kicked in and I thought, but does it know if my whole body is moving?
What if I had a glass of wine and I was going like that?
Would it know?
The answer is no. It does not know.
I drank two and a half miles while watching the lastâ€“
[applause]
Thank you.
Two and a half miles while watching the last Republican debate.
I know I wonâ€™t vote for any politician who says this, uh, at anytime.
If they say it. So far four of them have said it.
Itâ€™s like a hack line they say on the campaign trail.
I just find it so cheesy.
Theyâ€™ll go, â€œPeople, America is a place where your dreams can come true. Iâ€™m here to make your dreams come true. Wouldnâ€™t you like your dreams to come true?â€
Iâ€™m sitting there thinking, â€œNo. No, I donâ€™t.â€
And the fact that you said that makes me certain you have never drank a box of wine and taken an Ambien.
I do not want my dreams to come true.
It was horrifying. I did it like six weeks ago.
Here was the dream. This is the whole dream.
Iâ€™m in Alaska, wearing a sombrero.
Itâ€™s raining Cheetos, but I canâ€™t move my arms.
[groaning]
Three and a half hours of that. No thanks.
And then I turned on late-night TV, and thatâ€™s all the infomercials.
And there it was, the Sarah McLachlan sad animal commercial.
[audience groans]
Exactly. I feel the same way.
But Iâ€™ve seen it like 200 times.
And do you know what Iâ€™ve done? Honestly?
Nothing. And thatâ€™s not nice. But thatâ€™s the truth.
I thought, why donâ€™t I react to this?
I canâ€™t get an animal. Iâ€™m gone too much, but I could send the money.
I think they say like 62 cents a day for the dog or the cat, right?
But then I thought, â€œWell, I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on there, Sarah, but that kid on the other channel is only 55 cents a day. So maybe your catâ€™s living a little large, Sarah. Or maybe the child needs a raise. I donâ€™t know, but someone should check that before you start throwing figures like that out at night, late night when all the infomercials are on in a row.â€
And I thought, this ad doesnâ€™t work on me because itâ€™s so sad, I usually turn it off.
Like, you canâ€™t motivate people to action through the emotion of sadness.
You need to make people angry or shocked or appalled.
Thatâ€™s what gets people of their ass.
You donâ€™t ever see a protest with a bunch of people just laying around crying.
No. Thatâ€™s not going to happen.
And I thought, they need to redo this commercial to make a lot more money for the animals.
Iâ€“ This is what Iâ€™m doing late night after my Ambien and boxed wine.
Iâ€™m thinking of how to fix the commercial.
And Iâ€“ I would call Sarah back. She seems like a lovely lady.
Call her up in Canada and go, â€œWe really messed up. We need you back down here, and weâ€™re going to reshoot the commercial.â€
You pay for her to come back to America.
You go, â€œHereâ€™s whatâ€™s gonnaâ€“ Hereâ€™s how itâ€™s going to work, Sarah. Weâ€™re going to send you out to that song that you wrote, the saddest song ever written on earth.â€
â™ª In the arms â™ª
[yowling] I donâ€™t know what the words are.
I think itâ€™s about that cat having pink eye, but I canâ€™tâ€“
I donâ€™t know. That one definitely has pink eye.
Itâ€™s dangerous â€™cause itâ€™s gonna hop to the other eye like Bob Costas at the Olympics.
Itâ€™sâ€“ Itâ€™s a mess.
You got to put hot water on it. And cats donâ€™t like water.
I donâ€™t know how you would begin to fix that.
But hereâ€™s whatâ€™s gonna happen, Sarah.
Youâ€™re gonna walk out to that song that you wrote. Lovely song.
And in one hand, youâ€™re going to be holding a beagle puppy.
And in the other hand, youâ€™re going to be holding a pistol.
Remember, this is for the animals. Stay with me.
And then Iâ€™m going to need you, Sarah, to say in your oh-so-angelic voice, without laughingâ€“
You have to be serious.
Sheâ€™ll go, â€œHello. Iâ€™m Sarah McLachlan. If someone doesnâ€™t come down hereâ€¦ in the next 45 minutes, Iâ€™m gonna blow this beagleâ€™s brains out.â€
I would be horrified.
Iâ€™d be like, â€œCan you Shazam her location? Where is she?â€
And I would drive down there, and I would take the puppy and kick the gun out of her hand.
And where did you even get a gun? Youâ€™re Canadian.
Youâ€™re allowed one bear gun per family, Sarah.
That is not a bear gun.
You guys have been a lot of fun. If you drank and youâ€™re gonna drive, focus.
Donâ€™t be playing with your phone.
I am not advocating drinking and driving.
Iâ€™m not.
Drinking and driving is really bad.
And itâ€™s really badâ€“ I never thought about this.
But I have a friend, who told me to say was a very handsome friend, Rick in Denver, he got a DUI.
I never thought about this until he told me what happens.
Now when you get taken to jail, they take all your stuff.
That includes your phone. And they lock it all in a drawer.
Then they come back to your cell and tell you youâ€™re now allowed to make one phone call.
[blows air]
Well, thatâ€™s the problem.
â€™Cause you just locked my brain in a drawer.
I donâ€™t know anybodyâ€™s phone numbers by heart anymore.
Seriously, I donâ€™t.
I donâ€™t know what Iâ€“ Whatâ€“ What would you do?
I know the number of the house I grew up in.
I could call that familyâ€¦ and hope that they were really nice people.
â€œDonâ€™t hang up. Donâ€™t hang up. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Iâ€™m in so much trouble. I know you guys are kind of busy in Ferguson. Do you have $2,800?â€
Then I thought, seriously? They wouldnâ€™t let you look at your phone?
He goes, â€œKathleen, you donâ€™t get it. No, no.â€
I go, â€œI think thatâ€™s being stringent. Youâ€™re not a murderer. Youâ€™re not a rapist. Youâ€™re Drunky the Clown. Youâ€™ve been captured. You canâ€™t hurt anybody. They wouldnâ€™t even show you your contacts?â€
â€œNo.â€
I thought, especially if I had been drinking, thatâ€™s when my jackass behavior would kick in.
And I would say, â€œOkay, Iâ€™m ready for my call.â€
I let them bring me the phone, and my one call, I would call 911 from the cell.
[chuckling]
â€œHello. Oh, yes, this is absolutely an emergency.â€
[blows air] â€œWell, I have been kidnapped. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going on here. I was abducted by two men in matching outfits. And I was thrown into what I can only surmise right now is some sort of sex dungeon.â€
[chuckling]
â€œNo, Iâ€™m not laughing. No, Iâ€™m not laughing. My location? Well, that actually is kind of funny. Ifâ€“ If you would just glance down the hall. Ha ha!â€
All right, you guys, thank you so much. Iâ€™ve had a great time. Thank you for coming out. We appreciate it. Lew too. Thank you. Good night. Thank you. Good night. Thank you, guys. Thank you.
[Arden] â™ª Kathleen â™ª
â™ª Madigan â™ª
<END>

<START>
As our friend Jeff Harmon says, you know a cityâ€™s great when it welcomes you with a fistâ€¦ A big, black fist. Itâ€™s right in your face. No explanation. Justâ€¦ â€œGuess what. Somebody, while youâ€™re here, may or may not punch you in the face, and this is what the fist will look like when it comes to your face.â€ Yeah, itâ€™s Joe Louisâ€™. Look it up. Bye. White castle. I need to get a little drink of beer before I do this, maybe two.
Ladies and gentlemen, my good friend and someone who is probably the funniest person I know. Please give a good, loud, warm Detroit welcome to Kathleen Madigan.
Wow. Thank you. Thank you guys so much. And how about one big hand for a guy working for $500 tonightâ€¦ Mr. Lewis Black? Thank you guys so much for coming out, and this took me 25 years to have enough say-so toâ€¦ â€œWell, where do you want to tape your special?â€ â€œWell, you have to go here. You have to go there.â€ And now, finally, Iâ€™m old enough where I go, â€œno, no. Weâ€™re gonna go where I want to go.â€ And they go, â€œwhere do you want to go?â€ I said, â€œI want to go toÂ  .â€ And they said, â€œwhy?â€ I said, â€œtwo reasons. Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m fond of all of you, and I know that in Detroit, at any given moment, something weird and bad could happen to all of you. And second of all, the people of Detroitâ€¦ perhaps for those of you who havenâ€™t read a newspaperâ€¦ are the most optimistic people. Theyâ€™re still there. Do you understand? They are still there.â€ â€œ60 minutesâ€ has covered it. 20/20â€³ has covered it. The New York Times has covered it, and what is the conversation at the dinner table? Well, somethingâ€™s gonna happen. Itâ€™s got to turn around. I mean, I donâ€™t know when, but Iâ€™m certainly not leaving yet. I have hope. I mean, that Kwame Kilpatrick was crazy, but you move on. You do, you move onâ€¦ And you find a better man.â€
I do love this city. And, you know, I donâ€™t know if this is progress, but normally, and this is my city included, weâ€™re usually flip-flopped in number one and number two in murder. Itâ€™s usually Detroit and then St. Louis, which is why I feel so close to you people. I understand the element that you live with, that at any moment, shit could get weird. Just driving down the road. You donâ€™t know. Things could get weird, but this year, no, no, no, no. Number one, Flint. Yeah. Iâ€™m like, â€œhow? How is that possible? Thereâ€™s not even any people there.â€ Are they just shooting people that drive by and counting that? Are they, like, tricking people to Flint? â€œFree money!â€ And then they shoot them and go, â€œthereâ€™s another one. Weâ€™re so gonna win this year.â€
And I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair that Detroit dropped to number three just because youâ€™ve actually shot everyone. Just because you did a good job doesnâ€™t mean you should lose gold ranking. Because thereâ€™s lovely parts of Detroit. Here, this whole area. People donâ€™t know that, though. They only know what you see on the news. You know, like, â€œare you afraid to go to Detroit?â€ No, Iâ€™m not afraid to go to Detroit. Iâ€™m not afraid of normal things. It amazes me whenâ€¦ My friend is a DVD distributor, and heâ€™s like, â€œyou know what people love? Horror movies, â€™cause teenagersâ€¦ They love to pay to be frightened.â€ I go, â€œthatâ€™s because they have not lived long enough to know that real life will scare the shit out of you.â€ There is no reason to go pay to be scared, â€™cause at this age, I could care less if a vampire walked in my house. I truly wouldnâ€™t even blink in an eye. But look at this mole. Yeah, that scares me. Look at that mole. Yeah. Itâ€™s got ridges on it now. It didnâ€™t three weeks ago, but I donâ€™t have time to go to a doctor, so I just ask other comedians. Like, â€œhey, does that look fucked up to you?â€ And they go, â€œno.â€ I go, â€œcool.â€ And then I go have another beer and forget about it.
Yeah, really, youâ€™re gonna pay to be scared? Iâ€™ll scare you. Hereâ€™s a letter from the IRS. Do you want to open that now or after youâ€™ve eaten lunch and you can vomit your $8 lunch special? Iâ€™m not afraid of a burglar. Iâ€™m afraid of the mailman. Thatâ€™s who Iâ€™m afraid of. That son of a bitch hasnâ€™t brought anything good to my house since I was ten. Thatâ€™s the last time I got a birthday card with money in it. That was it. Ever since then, nothing.
But I do love the post office, which is a bit of a dichotomy, because I cannot believe at this age, I have friends that when they raised the price of a stamp, my friends will go insane. Young people in their 30s and 40s. Itâ€™s not old people on a budget. 30-year-olds. â€œMy god, they raised the price of stamps. â€œJesus Christ, this is highway robbery. This federal governmentâ€¦â€ Really? Itâ€™s 49 cents. Youâ€™re angry about that? â€˜Cause I feel the exact opposite way. I cannot believe, to this day, that I can walk into a building with a piece of paper in my hand and look at a full-grown adult and go, â€œheyâ€¦ â€œ49 centsâ€¦ Will you take this to Alaska?â€ They go, â€œyes, maâ€™am. Weâ€™ll have it there in two days. Is there anything else youâ€™d like?â€ â€œMore stamps. This is crazy.â€
And then the governmentâ€™s cutting some of the post office. That makes me sad, â€™cause then thereâ€™s always that big argument. Should the government pay for programs like that or not? I donâ€™t know. I feel back and forth. PBSâ€¦ Mitt Romney said cancel it. No. Thatâ€™s Sesame Street. You canâ€™t do that. But you could do PBS better than itâ€™s being done. I can tell youâ€¦ I donâ€™t get it. I know in hotels itâ€™s always the channel thatâ€™s on. So, like, Iâ€™ll come home from a show. Maybe Iâ€™ve had two or four glasses of wine, and maybe itâ€™s late, and maybe Iâ€™m in a sentimental mood, and thatâ€™s what PBS does. They show sentimental concerts. Itâ€™s those three old people sitting on a couch. Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re talking directly to you.
â€œHey, Kathleen, welcome home from the show. Did you have a good time tonight?â€
â€œYeah, yeah, I did. I had a good time tonight.â€
â€œWould you like to hear a little John Denver this evening?â€
â€œYes, I love John Denver.â€
I donâ€™t tell people that. It sounds geeky, and Iâ€™m still really angry at him for not putting enough gas in his airplane. I donâ€™t understandâ€¦ I donâ€™t understand how you do that. Youâ€™re an American icon. Check your gas Gauge. All right, okay.
â€œBut, yes, Iâ€™d like to hear some John Denver.â€
â€œWould you like to hear John Denver sing â€˜Sunshineâ€™?â€
â€œYeah. I love â€˜sunshine.'â€
And then, bam, they blast you to red rocks. There it is, Colorado, red rocks, 1978. Thereâ€™s John Denver singing it. Sunshine on my shoulders makes meâ€¦ And then heâ€™s gone, and itâ€™s the old people again.
â€œHey, Kathleen, were you enjoying that song?â€
â€œYeah, yeah, I was.â€
â€œWould you like to hear John sing the rest of â€˜Sunshineâ€™?â€
â€œYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I would.â€
â€œWell, hereâ€™s the thing. We are $84 short, and we got Peter, Paul, and Mary coming up next, and I know you donâ€™t want â€˜puff the magic dragonâ€™ interrupted, so why donâ€™t you just go ahead and put $250 down on your credit card and enjoy your evening?â€
You wonder about our government spending money.
You wonder who makes these decisions, â€™cause Lewis and I have gone to Iraq and Afghanistan over and over, and weâ€¦ Please, donâ€™t. Thatâ€™s very kind that you clapped. Yeah. I donâ€™t even say that for applause, â€™cause, really, I wouldnâ€™t go if I remembered the number and didnâ€™t pick up. Itâ€™s just Iâ€™m too catholic, and Iâ€™m too guilty to say no. I canâ€™t lie like that. Iâ€™m a terrible liar. They would know I was lying. No, I just go. But Afghanistan, I mean, with theâ€¦ Unbelievable. I donâ€™t even understand. You get there, and youâ€™re like, â€œwhat, what, what are weâ€¦ What are we going for here?â€ â€˜Cause theyâ€¦ Itâ€™s a horrible, horrible place. Itâ€™s freezing, which you would never think, because on the news, when you see the Taliban guys, theyâ€™re always just in a sheet. They donâ€™t have, like, aâ€¦ They donâ€™t wear a parka and mittens and stuff. It looks like fall, and you wear your sheet wear, and you run around andâ€¦ It looks like fall, and I always thought thatâ€™s why I would be a horrible terrorist, because Iâ€™m already prone to naps, and if you put me in a sheet all day, my god. Forget it, I would never leave the cave. I would be the worst terrorist ever. Iâ€™d be like, â€œyeah, I know everybodyâ€™s really mad, but Iâ€™m just gonna guard the cave while you guys go do that, and Iâ€™m gonna take a nice nap in this thread count. Have you felt my thread count? And I have a pillow conveniently located on the top of my head.â€
Itâ€™s freezing. Itâ€™s, like, ten degrees in Afghanistan, and thereâ€™s sand flying in your face at all times. I donâ€™t care what direction you look. Thereâ€™s sand flying in your face. So, it doesnâ€™t even make sense. In my Midwest mind, if sandâ€™s flying in my face, I should be in a swimming suit, holding a multicolored alcoholic drink I forgot I loved, whereâ€™s Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œRum! I love rum! I havenâ€™t had this since I vomited in high school. Iâ€¦ This is delicious.â€ Itâ€™s just, itâ€™s freezâ€¦ â€™cause my brother goes, â€œhow bad was it?â€ I go, â€œhereâ€™s how bad it was, Pat. Hereâ€™s what I want you to do. Go out into your garage. Take off all your clothes. Get into your walk-in freezer, and then, every 15 minutes, Iâ€™m gonna come out there and throw sand in your face.â€ Yeah.
They flew us around in Black Hawk helicopters. The doors are open. People are shooting at you. You can see the ground, â€™cause thatâ€™s how close you are to the ground, which is creepy, and at one point, weâ€¦ And itâ€™s very loud. You have these headphone things on. We flew over a bunch of camels just running around, and Lew goes, â€œare those wild?â€ I said, â€œI donâ€™t know what you mean by that, but I donâ€™t see saddles on them, and I donâ€™t see tiny monkey jockeys, and I donâ€™t see a betting window, so I donâ€™t think weâ€™re at a camel track. Yes, I think theyâ€™re wild.â€
He goes, â€œwhere are we?â€ Itâ€™s like, â€œI donâ€™t know, but from what I can see, Iâ€™d say weâ€™ve flown to the Bible.â€
â€œAnd the old testament, Lew, the bad Bible, where shitâ€™s on fire for no reason. God is a lunatic. â€˜Youâ€™re misbehaving. Iâ€™m throwing locusts at your heads.â€™ bleh, bleh, bleh! Not the new testament, Lew. Not the fun Bible, where thereâ€™s wine-and-cheese parties and people are getting risen from the dead.â€
â€œHey, Iâ€™m back. Iâ€™m back. Iâ€™m Lazarus. I was dead an hour ago. I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s happening. Whereâ€™s the wine? I heard heâ€™s making wine somewhere. That guyâ€¦â€
â€œLove that guy.â€
Thatâ€™s how horrible it is, and you go, â€œreally? This is what weâ€™re spending our money on?â€ And they go, â€œKathleen, you know, we hardly ever have female entertainers. You should go down to the female marine tent and have a little talk with them.â€ I said, â€œokay.â€ So, I go down there. I go, â€œwhat do you ladies do all day on the base?â€ They go, â€œwe go into the local Taliban-run town and speak to the women, the locals, about womenâ€™s rights.â€ I go, â€œreally?â€ I go, â€œdo you speak Afghani or whatever it is?â€ And they were like, â€œno.â€ I go, â€œdo they speak English?â€ They were like, â€œno.â€ I said, â€œlet me get this straight. Our federal government is paying for you to go into a Taliban-run town and play a game of charadesâ€¦â€ â€œWith a lady dressed up like a beekeeperâ€¦â€ â€œAnd try to trick her into leaving her husband, who thinks itâ€™s the year 11, by the way, and he liked that year.â€ That was a great year if you were a dudeâ€¦ 11. I just donâ€™t see that happening. Call me a pessimist. I just donâ€™t see that lady whipping that burka off and going, â€œthatâ€™s it, Mohammed. Seriously, Iâ€™ve had it. Iâ€™ve had it. Iâ€™m leaving you. Seriously, as soon as this country gets a road. I mean, we donâ€™t have any roads yet, but as soon as those dumb-ass Americans build us a road, I am so out of here with it.â€
And itâ€™s not just dumb-ass Americans. No. Everybodyâ€™s involved in Afghanistan. Itâ€™s a whole NATO thing, â€™cause when you get on the base, they tell you, first of all, youâ€™re gonna be bunking with some Afghani soldiers. â€œReally? Iâ€™m not totally comfortable with that. Thereâ€™s some Canadians. Maybe we could switch them out, â€™cause those are nice people, and they like beer, and I can talk to them about Wayne Gretzky or something. Whyâ€¦ why canâ€™t we do a switch-a-rooni?â€
They take you on the tour of the base. Whatâ€™s even more surprising than the Afghanis is they go, thatâ€™s the Canadian soldiersâ€™ tent. Thatâ€™s the French. Thatâ€™s the Germans. Thatâ€™s the Belgians.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œback up. Did you just say the German soldiersâ€™ tent? When were they allowed back in the game? I think there shouldâ€™ve been a vote. I donâ€™t understand how theyâ€™ve snuck back in. Do you people not have the history channel? They canâ€™t be trusted yet. Every 50 years, they get together and have too many beers, and things get weird worldwide, not just in a bar.â€
They said, â€œwell, no, you know, thatâ€™s the deal.â€
And you go to your tent, and thereâ€™s no alcohol in this country. Thatâ€™s the number-one reason I would be angry if I lived there. The more I was around these people in their homeland, the more I understood their anger and their willingness to blow themselves up. Thereâ€™s no alcohol at all. And itâ€™s not like, ha, ha, sneaky, sneaky. No. None. Then, when you go to bed in your bunk, and forâ€¦ Over loudspeakers, every four hours throughout the entire country, so thereâ€™s no escaping it, you will hear thisâ€¦ And then it turns into â€œlandslide.â€ And the landslide broughtâ€¦ Okay, no, it doesnâ€™t, but it did in my head. I made it do that every night in my head. Iâ€™ve been afraid ofâ€¦ My god. My god. And the first night, I didnâ€™t know what it was, and I jumped out of my bunk, and I put my glasses on, and Lewâ€™s still sound asleep.
Iâ€™m like, â€œwake up. Whatâ€™s happening? What is that man singing? What isâ€¦ are we being attacked? I knew we shouldnâ€™t have left our helmets in the Van. I didnâ€™t trust that man. I wanted my helmet.â€
He goes, â€œKathleen, youâ€™re crazy. Itâ€™s just their call to prayer. Get back in your bunk and be quiet.â€
I said, â€œsorry.â€ I go back to my bunk, but I noticed all the Afghani soldiers did it. Boom, as soon as they heard that man, they got their prayer mats out. They jumped out, and they all got down, and they faced left. It wasâ€¦ I donâ€™t know what direction it was. It was left to me. In my world, thatâ€™s a hard left from my bunk, right? Iâ€™d always do a left â€™cause thatâ€™s what I saw first. But I thought, you know, no wonder these people are angry. They have no alcohol, and theyâ€™ve never slept eight hours in a row. I mean, are you kidding me? This goes on every four hours? But I couldnâ€™t believe their obedience. Think whatever you want to think about their religion. Look at their obedience. I am catholic. That whole program would lastâ€¦ One night. That would be it. One night. They would try it one night, and then the excuses would start, and that would be my favorite part.
â€œWell, hereâ€™s the thing. I had a mat, and I loaned it to my brother Bob, and let me tell you what. That son of a bitch doesnâ€™t return a thing. I loaned him a lawn mower back in 1978, and I still havenâ€™t seen it. Havenâ€™t gotten any overtime and canâ€™t afford a new prayer mat. You canâ€™tâ€¦ itâ€™s not right to do it without the mat, so Iâ€™m just gonna sit this one out for a decade.â€
Wow, this is the wholeâ€¦ This is the whole war. This is what weâ€™re doing, and we didnâ€™t even spend the money, â€™cause they go, â€œif youâ€™re gonna take a shower here, in the shower building, you might want to wear your tennis shoes and extra socks, â€™cause if youâ€™ll notice, this is all Russian equipment.â€ Itâ€™s from the â€™70s. We didnâ€™t bring new stuff. The Russian stuff is still there. Iâ€™m like, did we learn nothing? Really? The Russians, the toughest people on earth, people who tricked Hitler into a snowstorm were freaked out by these people. These people in the middle of the night went, â€œholy crap, theyâ€™re crazy,â€ and ran home like girls and left everything. They left tanks. They left barracks. They left apartments. Theyâ€™re like, â€œhereâ€™s the keys, man. You want to give it a whirl? Seriously, we are sneaking out at midnight. This is insane.â€ And they told us, â€œif youâ€™re gonna take a shower, wear your socks and shoes, because, we donâ€™t publicize this, but weâ€™ve had quite a few cases of electrocution.â€ I was like, â€œwell, Iâ€™m out. Iâ€™m done showering. You think Iâ€™m gonna trust my life to socks and a pair of pumas I bought at Marshalls for $57? These arenâ€™t even running shoes, you moron. Theyâ€™re just cute. Theyâ€™re accent shoes. Iâ€™m not gonna trust my lifeâ€¦â€
Itâ€™s horrible. I didnâ€™t shower for, like, I donâ€™t know, 13, 14 days. I know, itâ€™s gross. Itâ€™s even gross to admit, but Iâ€™m admitting it. Then they drop you off in the D.C. airport, and youâ€™re on your own to get yourself home. Fine. I need to go to St. Louis for Christmas. I go to the airport bar at 6:00 A.M. I still havenâ€™t showered. Thereâ€™s nowhere to shower. I have glasses on, no makeup. My hair is in a baseball hat that theyâ€™ve given me that says â€œuso.â€ Itâ€™s a free, just, hat. I go in the bar. Thereâ€™s one guy. Heâ€™s about 70, and heâ€™s hammered. I thought, good for you, sir. I donâ€™t even know how this happens or why it happened, but itâ€™s 6:00 A.M. in D.C., and youâ€™re at the airport, hammered. I donâ€™t even know what the story is, but Iâ€™m a fan. I like it. I wish I had that kind of time. Hey, you want to go get drunk? Hey, letâ€™s have some fun. Letâ€™s go to the airport and not have to fly anywhere. Thatâ€™ll be stress-free and fun, for once.
Soâ€¦ I donâ€™t want to talk to him, though. I donâ€™t want to talk to anybody. I justâ€¦ Iâ€™m tired, Iâ€™m crabby, Iâ€™m filthy. I just want to eat American breakfast and speak to no one and get on my plane, and I look down, and I hear from the other end of the barâ€¦ This is all I hearâ€¦ And I kept looking down, and I thought, wow, thatâ€™s the greatest pickup lineâ€¦ Ever. You canâ€™t not look at that person, after that person just did that. Now, I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re a bear and I didnâ€™t look right. Or are you a pirate? What is happening? You canâ€™t not look up. So I look up, and he goesâ€¦ â€œI see your hat, honey. â€œIt says â€˜uso.â€™ are you, are you with them?â€ I said, â€œI donâ€™t know what you mean â€˜with them,â€™ sir. â€œI just, I just went to Afghanistan and did some shows for the troops.â€ He goes, â€œyou did some shows? â€œWhat are youâ€¦ â€œWhat are you, like, a showgirl or a stripper?â€ I was pissed for, like, half a second, and then I was like, â€œI should marry this guy.â€ Are you serious? â€œI have head lice right now, sir. â€œMy hatâ€™s moving. â€œMy hatâ€™s moving on its own, â€œand somehow, you look through all this, â€œand you see showgirl, stripper, cleaner-upper. You can seeâ€¦â€
Wow. I did go home. I went home to St. Louis for Christmas, and I walked into my parentâ€™s house, which I hadnâ€™t been into in about, I donâ€™t know, six months, and unbeknownst to me, they changed all the light bulbs in the house into those energy-saving light bulbs. So, when I walked in, as if I havenâ€™t had enough weird lighting in Afghanistan, theyâ€™re sitting in this weird, dim, hazy lighting, and Iâ€™m like, â€œhey. Whatâ€™s going on, guys? We, we having a seance?â€ My dad goes, â€œno, no, weâ€™re not, Kathleen. Your mother thought it would be a good idea at our age, when our eyesight is failingâ€¦ To make the house as dimly lit as possible, Kathleenâ€¦ Because sheâ€™s upset because Al Goreâ€™s upset because thereâ€™s no more polar bears. Well, you know what? Iâ€™m 69 years old. I live in Missouri. Iâ€™ve never seen a polar bear. I donâ€™t care if I ever see a polar bear. What Iâ€™d like to see is the coffee table. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d like to see.â€
Then that starts the side argument. â€œItâ€™s not because of Al Gore, Jack. They just donâ€™t make the regular light bulbs anymore. I canâ€™t find the regular light bulbs. When did they stop making regular light bulbs, and why werenâ€™t we notified in the mail by the government? I mean, weâ€™re only gonna live ten more years. I could have bought enough light bulbs for the rest of our lives. I would have bought extra and sold them out of the back of the truck to other old people who didnâ€™t know. I couldâ€™ve jacked the price up.â€
My god. Theyâ€™re up all the time. It doesnâ€™t matter what time you call the house. One of them is up. Yeah, it could be 2:00 in the afternoon, 3:00 in the morning, 5:00 A.M., 11:00. Hello? Yeah, theyâ€™re up. They call me from weird places. Itâ€™s 6:00 A.M. where I am. Itâ€™s 5:00 A.M. where they are.
â€œHello?â€
â€œWhat are you doing?â€
â€œMore importantly, what are you doing, mom?â€
â€œWell, weâ€™re at home depotâ€™s parking lot. Weâ€¦ We thought they opened at 6:00. They donâ€™t. Theyâ€¦ So weâ€™re just going to sit here for an hour and look at the other old people that were confused by the ad.â€
I said, â€œmom, why arenâ€™t you sleeping anymore?â€
â€œWell, donâ€™t tell your father this, â€™cause heâ€™ll be embarrassed, but now weâ€™re afraid weâ€™re gonna die in our sleep, so weâ€™ve decided weâ€™ll just stay up, and one of us will be up, and then weâ€™ll nap, â€™cause you never hear of somebody dying while they were napping. You donâ€™t hear, â€˜he died in his nap.â€™ â€œYou hear, â€˜they died in their sleep,â€™ but if we both fall asleep, we wonâ€™t know the other oneâ€™s dead, and thatâ€™s how things get out of hand.â€
â€œOkay. Okay. Okay, mom.â€
I went to Target with her. My mom was a nurse for 30 years. Sheâ€™s retired. I said, out of nowhere, while weâ€™re pushing a cart, â€œgod, I have a splitting sinus headache.â€ She goes, â€œhere,â€ and roots through her giant purse and goes, â€œtake this.â€ And I took it, and about a second later, I hear, â€œâ€ I said, â€œwhatâ€¦ what was that all about?â€ She goes, â€œyou swallow that?â€ â€œYep. Sure did. Swallowed it.â€ â€œWhat color was it?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know, mom. I donâ€™t know. I didnâ€™t look at what color it was.â€ â€œKathleen, why didnâ€™t you look at what color the pill was?â€ â€œWhy? Why? â€˜Cause youâ€™re not somebody I met at a party.â€ â€œYouâ€™re my mom. â€œYou were a nurse for 30 years. â€œI bought the whole story. I did. I trusted you. I ate it blind. I just ate it blind.â€ I said, â€œwell, if you had to guess, what kind of pill do you think I ate?â€ She said, â€œwell, I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s hard to tell. â€œIt came out of the blue, unmarked bottle â€œthat your father and I call the â€˜all-stars,â€™ andâ€¦â€ â€œIt could be anything from pain medication to blood-pressure pills, Kathleen.â€ I said, â€œwhat if itâ€™s his blood-pressure medication?â€ She said, â€œyouâ€™re gonna pass out, â€œand thatâ€™s why we should abandon our carts and leave this target immediately, because I canâ€™t drag you out of here with this bad knee. â€œThat knee replacement did not work. â€œI donâ€™t care what he says. â€œIt didnâ€™t work. â€œAnd youâ€™re not gonna want me to drive home, Kathleen, â€œâ€™cause it takes forever, because I donâ€™t make left turns anymore.â€ Really? Wow. Now I donâ€™t even care what kind of pill I ate. Now I just want to understand why she doesnâ€™t make left turns anymore. I was like, what? â€œItâ€™s not always lefts. â€œItâ€™s anything into oncoming traffic â€œwhere you have to cross lanes to get to your lanes. â€œU.p.s. Doesnâ€™t allow their drivers to do it, â€œand they save millions of dollars. â€œYour father and I are retired. We have that kind of time. â€œYou drive to the next light, â€œand you cautiously make a u-turn, Kathleen. Thatâ€™s what you do.â€
They are starting to do crazy things. About, I donâ€™t know, four days later, I went back into her purse to get a little something else out of that all-star bottleâ€¦ Which turned out to be delicious, and I thought I had one of my nephewâ€™s guns in myâ€¦ And it was like a toy, but it was kind of heavy, and I was like, â€œâ€ she goes, â€œcareful. Thatâ€™s loaded.â€ I go, â€œreally, mom? You just walk around with a loaded pistol all the time now?â€ â€œYeah.â€ I go, â€œreally? Why?â€ And without missing a beat, she goes, â€œrape.â€ â€œReally?â€ I go, â€œwait a minute, mom. Wait a minute. â€œYou mean you think youâ€™re gonna get raped, â€œor do you mean â€œyou think weâ€™re gonna stumble upon a rape in progress â€œand then shoot the rapist and become CNN heroes and get to meet Anderson Cooper?â€ â€œBecause at 70, mom, Iâ€™m not saying â€œyouâ€™re still not as cute as the devil, â€œâ€™cause you are, but I think youâ€™ve slipped â€œout of the, â€˜holy crap, I got to rape that lady right nowâ€™ category.â€ â€œI think youâ€™ve dropped down into â€˜I think I might steal â€œthat ladyâ€™s Cadillac at walgreenâ€™s â€œâ€™cause she leaves the keys on the pharmacy counter for at least 37 minutes every time she shops, â€œthen she goes out â€œand canâ€™t remember where she parked the car. Still doesnâ€™t know if she has the keys.'â€ it is cool to so see your parents get older, though, and not care anymore. â€˜Cause there are seven kids in my family. They were as strict as you could be, but now theyâ€™re grandparents. My one brotherâ€™s got three boys. Theyâ€™re four, two, and nothing, whatever you call that. I donâ€™t know. Heâ€™s new. And my parents volunteered to babysit for three days while him and his wife went away. I said, â€œIâ€™ll come down and help you for a couple days. Iâ€™m off in the middle. Sure, Iâ€™ll help.â€ And my dad, very patient. My mom, still not even to this day. She told the older one, â€œPatrick, I need you to put the iPad down.â€ He goes, â€œno.â€ Wow! Look at the guts on him. She told me to eat a pill, and I just did it. At this age, like, I donâ€™t evenâ€¦ I donâ€™t evenâ€¦ no! I didnâ€™t even look at what color it was. Thatâ€™s how obedient I am. Wow, look at this guy. Look at this guy. Four. â€œNo.â€ She said, â€œPatrick, Iâ€™m not kidding. I said, put the iPad down.â€ He goes, â€œno,â€ and he shut the door right in herâ€¦ Right at her. My mom unravels. â€œJack, Jack. Did you see what he did? Did you see what that little son of a bitch just did?â€ â€œVicky, Vicky, you are 70. He is four. â€œGet a handle on yourself. Get a handle on yourself. â€œWe canâ€™t re-parent these people in three days. â€œI donâ€™t care what goes on here. â€œItâ€™s our job to get out alive, okay? I donâ€™tâ€¦â€ â€œI donâ€™t care if he eats the iPad. I donâ€™t. â€œWeâ€™ll buy another iPad. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll do. â€œAll I know is, two hours before they get home, â€œweâ€™re gonna shower the three of them, â€œput them on the couch, and go, â€˜they were lovely,â€™ â€œand then weâ€™re going to the casino. â€œThatâ€™s how this is gonna end. Thatâ€™s how this is gonna end.â€
Yeah, theyâ€™ve gotten more liberal the older theyâ€™ve gotten, which is weird, â€™cause usually parents go the other way. Like, the very first Obama election, I wanted Hillary. My parents are old-school democrats, but my dad does not like the Clintons. He hates the Clintons â€™cause of NAFTA. He is never gonna get over NAFTA. â€œHow could you think about supporting that woman? She was with him the whole way on NAFTA, the whole way.â€ And if youâ€™d like to know exactly whatâ€™s wrong with NAFTA and the problems that it has caused this country, you can call 573â€¦ 348, blah, blah, blah, blah, ask for Jack, and you will get a two-hour dissertation on why exactly this country is falling apart. They wanted Obama. I just neverâ€¦ I voted for Obama, but I neverâ€¦ I always thought, I think he thinks weâ€™re a little bit more of a team than we are. Like, hereâ€™s the thing, sir. We get you elected, and then you do shit, and then you tell us about it. Thatâ€™s how I thought this was gonna roll. No, not with Obama. See, heâ€™s on the TV all the time. â€œAmerica, Iâ€™m going to need your help on this.â€ Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, we are busy, okay? Shark Week is on. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re familiar with that. Thatâ€™s not something you tape. You got to watch that live. It always sucks on tape.
Doomsday Preppers, I have eight episodes I have yet to watch. I donâ€™t even watch reality, but if you have never seen that show, I think itâ€™s the craziest you could be. They are preparing for the end of the world, these people. They all think itâ€™s something differentâ€¦ A dirty bomb, the governmentâ€™s gonna take over, or they have craâ€¦ all these ideas of how the worldâ€™s gonna end, but theyâ€™ve prepared differently. They have bunkers. They have medicine for life. But whatâ€™s even more bizarre than what theyâ€™re doing is, every single one of them is married. Wow. Really? I have normal, nice friends that canâ€™t get a date, and you, youâ€¦ Howâ€™d you throw that out on christianmingle.com and get a hit back? Thatâ€™s all I want to know. How do you just toss that out there like itâ€™s normal? â€œHobbiesâ€¦ Preparing for the end of the world.â€ But you canâ€™t throw something else in. â€œTennis.â€ I mean, what? No. And then somebody hit you back. â€œOMG, me too. Meet me at Costco. Lots of things to buy. Canâ€™t wait. This is gonna get weird. Waiting for shit to get weird. Waiting for shit to get weird.â€
Obama, heâ€™s always reaching out. God love him.
â€œAmerica, if you agree with me on how to solve this financial crisis, Iâ€™m gonna need you to email your congressman and representatives.â€
Iâ€™m like, â€œwell, then, Iâ€™m gonna need you to email me who they are.â€ Because unless theyâ€™re hosting Shark Week or preparing for the end of the world, I am probably not familiar with their work, â€™cause the ticket didnâ€™t say, â€œObama, Madigan.â€ The ticket said, â€œObama, Biden.â€ So, if you need some help, I suggest you get that smiling Irishman you hired out of a barâ€¦ Who is my favorite person on the planet, by the way, â€™cause thereâ€™s a reason heâ€™s always smiling, â€™cause he was smart enough to go for vice president. Yes, all the alcohol, none of the problems. That is the job you go for if you haveâ€¦ What do you want to be number one for? Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh. Bringâ€¦ cut your ego down a level. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with Air Force Two. Same plane, different number. Same plane. Yes, yes, and you donâ€™t even have to answer anything.
â€œWhat do you think about the finanâ€¦?â€
â€œI donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t really want to talk about it. The ice in my Margarita is melting, though, and I have to go to a funeral in Turkey of a person Iâ€™ve never heard of, and I got to act sad, so Iâ€™m gonna need a few more drinks, and Iâ€™ll talk to you guys later.â€
Obama, I really thinkâ€¦ He starts out on such a high intellectual level sometimes. I saw him two months ago on TV. He just gave a random speech.
He goes, â€œAmerica, Iâ€™m here to update you about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.â€
Really? Itâ€™s gonna start right there? Well, Iâ€™m here to update you, sir. Thatâ€™s funny. I have an update too. Up until six months ago, I thought Fannie Mae was a candy factory in Chicago. Thank you. And I couldnâ€™t understand why a candy factory was allowed to hand out home loans, and then I really couldnâ€™t understand who thought to go there. Like, thatâ€™s brilliant. Like, â€œwell, hey, the bank said no. Why donâ€™t we go down to the candy factory and see if theyâ€™llâ€¦? They seem to be doing well.â€
Andâ€¦ and I thought Freddie Mac was a candy bar that they made I hadnâ€™t yet tasted, and I thought, â€œIâ€™m gonna look for that at the airport, and I hope it has caramel in it.â€ â€˜Cause they speak about these things as if weâ€™re all updated. The deficitâ€¦ they say that as if itâ€™s a real, tangible number.
â€œThe deficit is 3 trillionâ€¦ 7,804. Now is the time to get concerned.â€
Really? Now? Why? Why now? Youâ€™re in charge. You didnâ€™t panic at 2 trillion. I think youâ€™re bullshitting. I donâ€™t believe you. I donâ€™t believe you. I donâ€™t believe you. And I canâ€™t even fathom $1 trillion. None of us can. I mean, we canâ€™t. You canâ€™t. Itâ€™s not a tangible thing. I would be more frightened and motivated to action if I saw one of thoseâ€¦ One of the important politicians come on TV and go, â€œthe deficit is mashed potatoes.â€ What? Wait a minute. What did he say? What is he implying? Are we running out of mashed potatoes? Thatâ€™s ridiculous. Thatâ€™s my favorite thing in the whole world. If that is true, then someone get Idaho on the phone right now and go, â€œhello, you were in charge of two thingsâ€¦ crazy militias and potatoes, and if you canâ€™t keep that together anymoreâ€¦â€
I donâ€™t even understand the difference between the deficit and the debt, and my brotherâ€™s a financial advisor, and heâ€™s younger than me, and he knows how to speak, like, you know, down to my level. And I said, â€œPat, in an easy way, explain to me, what is the difference between the deficit and the debt.â€
He goes, â€œokay, I will. Just pay attention.â€
And he started talking, and I donâ€™t know how far in it was. I would sayâ€¦ I would say probably the 40-second Mark, I drifted out a lot, right? But he didnâ€™t catch me until about the 90-second Mark, and heâ€™s like, â€œare you even paying attention anymore?â€
I go, â€œno, but I got to tell you what I have been doing. I heard about this, and now Iâ€™m doing it, and you have to do it at work, â€™cause itâ€™ll make you smile and laugh so hard. If you go to Google and type in â€˜Batman catâ€™ and then hit â€˜images,â€™ my god. Itâ€™s the funniest thing I ever seen. Itâ€™s real, pat. Itâ€™s not a joke. Itâ€™s a real cat. Itâ€™s a long-haired black and white, and they combed his hair, and it looks like the Batman mask. And, yeah, I mean, theyâ€™re holding him up, but thatâ€™s not cheating. I mean, theyâ€™re just holding him, and ifâ€¦ I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s for sale. Like, I donâ€™t even want a cat, but I want that cat, so every morning Iâ€™d wake up, heâ€™d be on my chest.â€ â€œIâ€™m Batman.â€ â€œYes, you are! Yes, you are!â€ â€œI would never not have a happy day if I owned that cat.â€
Heâ€™s like, â€œKathleen, Iâ€™m at work.â€
â€œYeah, whatever. I got to go. I got to go.â€
Yeah, but thatâ€™s what weâ€™re doing all day, Obama. I donâ€™t have time to help you. The Batman catâ€¦ Is trying to get some popularity going, and, you know, I wishâ€¦ Like, I try to pay attention. Itâ€™s also just too difficult. I mean, you know, a long time ago it wasnâ€™t hard. There was the morning newspaper and then the evening news, and the evening news wasnâ€™t a joke. No, they didnâ€™t talk about the Kardashians or Paris Hilton. It was just some old, mean white man whoâ€™d come out smoking a cigarette, always very angry.
â€œHello. Welcome to the â€˜Nightly News.â€™ Tonight weâ€™re gonna talk about Korea, and if you donâ€™t know where Korea is, get a goddamn map, you unpatriotic son of a bitch.â€
And youâ€™re like, â€œmy god! â€œMy god, whereâ€™s Korea? Hurry up. Find out. Heâ€™s gonna know we donâ€™t know. My god, Iâ€™m petrified of this person.â€
Yeah, now thereâ€™s a million news channels. Thereâ€™s a million websites. CNN.comâ€¦ â€œhereâ€™s Obamaâ€™s health care plan.â€ Boom, itâ€™s right there. 1,087 pages. Okay. And then right next to that, thereâ€™s a video. Itâ€™s 2:17 long, and it says, â€œbaby owls live in teacups.â€ Hello. Yeah, I realized Iâ€™ve never seen a baby owl, and I donâ€™t know why, and I want to see it. And why is it in a teacup? And why is this crazy old lady allowed to do this? And why isnâ€™t PETA over there, beating the crap out of her? There are so many questions I have about this video. Iâ€™m interested.
Itâ€™s too hard. Thereâ€™s too much information. Facebook, Twitter. Dear god, when does it stop? I donâ€™t do Facebook as much, â€™cause peopleâ€¦ You can type as much as you want, and thatâ€™s the problem. People donâ€™t know when to shut up. Itâ€™s like diarrhea of the fingers. Like, somebodyâ€¦ Like, a mob person should come in with a hammer and just break their fingers and go, â€œyouâ€™re done. Youâ€™re done.â€ â€œWell, I had a bagel this morning. I thought about having a doughnut, but Dr. Oz says theyâ€™re really the same thing. It depends on what you put on top of the bagel. I like that thick cream cheese. Sometimes Iâ€™ve seen people put salmon on top of a bagel. I find that so perplexing. Iâ€™m from Wisconsin. I canâ€™t imagine just slapping a walleye right on my thing. Maybe itâ€™s a Jewish thing.â€ Dah, dah-dah, dah! My god, no, no.
Thatâ€™s why I like Twitter. Itâ€™s 140 characters, and then they kick you off. You donâ€™t have to approve people. You can follow me. Yeah, thereâ€™s all kinds ofâ€¦ Itâ€™s like a mobile baby Jesus. People just sign up, follow me all through town. Great. Fine. 140 characters, thatâ€™s all you get. And I actually got in an argument with Lewis, my friend, â€™cause he goes, â€œthatâ€™s terrible. Is that what societyâ€™s come down to? 140 characters, thatâ€™s all your thought can be?â€ Yeah, Lew. Yeah, and I think itâ€™s wonderful, and I think if you think about it, if anything was really important throughout history, it couldâ€™ve been said in 140 characters or less. If they had Twitter whenever, â€œlook, hereâ€™s a tweet. â€˜The British are coming. The British are coming.â€™ There you go. Do you need to know anything more? No, you donâ€™t. You donâ€™t need to know anything more than that. â€˜Heads up, Nagasaki. Not kidding a second time either. #hopeyouhaveahat. Things are gonna get weird.â€™ â€ Yeah, Iâ€™m just saying, warnings, things like that.
Mitt Romney said, after many, many months, many, many months of thinking about why he lost the electionâ€¦ And you can Google thisâ€¦ He said he realized that it was mainly â€™cause he didnâ€™t tweet enough. Really? Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re gonna tell yourself before you go to sleep at night? That you were just one tweet away from winning? Itâ€™s amazing how people can fool themselves. I didnâ€™t vote for Mitt Romney. It had nothing to do with politics. I didnâ€™t vote for Mitt Romney. I will never vote for Mitt Romney because he said, and I know heâ€™s telling the truth â€™cause they would have proved differently, the press would have, and heâ€™s a devout Mormon, so I completely believe him, that at age 65, in his life, he had never had a drink, a drug, a cigarette, or a cigar, ever. As an Irish catholic, that sentence couldnâ€™t even go in my head. Error, error, error. Invalid information. Invalid information. Rephrase question. Rephrase question. Check Gauge. Check Gauge. Check Gauge.
So I said to my brother, â€œthink about it, Pat. The only people that we know that can truly say that are babies.â€ â€œAnd thatâ€™s just because they donâ€™t know yet. â€œYes, they like juice, but they havenâ€™t had a Bud Light. They donâ€™t know.â€
And I judged him for that, and thatâ€™s not fair to that man, but I did. I did, I judged him, because to me, a glass of wine or a cigarette or maybe a Lunestaâ€¦ One of my favorites. If youâ€™ve never taken a Lunesta, but youâ€™ve seen the commercial, Iâ€™m here to let you in on a little secret. That neon butterfly is real. Yeah. Wow! Green, pink. Theyâ€™re beautiful. But those are the ways a normal adult relieves stress, to meâ€¦ With a cigar, maybe some pot, whatever it is you do. And if you donâ€™t do any of those, any of them, my mind goes to an alarm state, where I go, â€œalien, alien. I think youâ€™re sleeping with a goat.â€ Thatâ€™s how weird it is to me. Thatâ€™s not fair to Mitt Romney.
I donâ€™t smoke pot. I never cared for it, but Iâ€™m very happy for my pot friends that use. This year, finally, in government something did change. A little bit of pot became legal in certain cities. Yeah, because I have plenty of pothead friends, and theyâ€™re very nice people. They donâ€™t do anything bad at all. They donâ€™t really do anything at all. Like, theyâ€™re just low-key people. They donâ€™t bother anybody. Theyâ€™re not a pain in my ass. My drinking friends, yeah, theyâ€™re a pain in my ass. I donâ€™t get calls from my pothead friends at 3:00 in the morning, â€œcan you come get me? Iâ€™m in jail. Iâ€™m so dead. I hit a lake. When did they put a lake on highway 40? Thatâ€™s ridiculous. There was no lake there, seriously. You got to bring 10 grand. Can you do that?â€ What?
It was always the argument against pot that I always found soâ€¦ It was just so fantastical. People would go so crazy. â€œYou cannot legalize marijuana. It is a gateway drug, for Christâ€™s sake. It is a gateway drug. If you legalize marijuana, the next thing you know, after a person smokes pot, they will be shooting heroin in a crack house in Cleveland with a dog named Banjo they didnâ€™t purchase.â€ What? What? Thatâ€™s crazy. And itâ€™s a bad premise. Not everythingâ€™s a gateway. Thatâ€™s where your premise is bad. Okay, when you were five and you stole a candy bar and you ate it, and it was delicious, was your next thought, â€œyou know what? Iâ€™m gonna kill a drifterâ€? No. No.
Iâ€™ve smoked cigarettes a lot of my life. I finally quit. I didnâ€™t want to quit. People who have never been addicted to anything never truly get it. Like, â€œmy god, you quit smoking. Do you feel better?â€ No. No. Iâ€™d love to shove your face through glass just for saying that and then smoke whateverâ€™s left on the other side. Thatâ€™s how irritable I am right now about the fact that I canâ€™t smoke a cigarette.
Iâ€™m just not that healthy of a person. I joined a gym, and then my gym closed, and then I had to go join another gym. Thatâ€™s a pain in the ass, â€™cause you canâ€™t just pay and go in. You have to have a meeting and a consultation with somebody.
â€œReally? I donâ€™t want to.â€
â€œWell, you have to, Kathleen. You have to meet with Cindy.â€
â€œOkay, great.â€
Cindy is 21. Cindy is in shape. Cindy is happy to be alive. Everything is going great in Cindyâ€™s world. Happiest thing ever, but her voice is so high. The tone and the pitchâ€¦ When she spoke, all I heard was a yorkie barking. I swear to god. Like, thatâ€™s all I heard.
â€œRuff-ruff-ruff-ruff. Hi. Welcome to the gym. Ruff-ruff. Fill out this form. Ruff-ruff-arrr-arrr, rrrr!â€
Itâ€™s like, â€œreally? I got to speak to this lady? Like, I have money. Canâ€™t I just go in?â€
â€œNo.â€
â€œOkay, Kathleen, before you can get in and everything, okay, we have to write down some of your goals.â€
â€œCindy, Cindy, I donâ€™t have any goals here. Maybe thatâ€™s weird, but I donâ€™t have any goals. Iâ€™m not here for offense, Cindy. Iâ€™m here for defense. Thereâ€™s a big difference. I am here to try and pull a fourth-quarter hail Mary pass out of my ass before things get weird. Nowâ€¦ I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s possible, but Iâ€™m willing to pay $62 a month to not come here and find out.â€
â€œBut, Kathleen, but, Kathleen, thatâ€™s so sad. Ruff-ruff-ruff. Arrrrrrrrr.â€
â€œNo, itâ€™s not sad. Itâ€™s justâ€¦â€
â€œWell, I have to put something on the form, or Iâ€™m going to get in trouble.â€
â€œOkay, hereâ€™s my goal. Ready? Ready? Hereâ€™s my goal. I am here to delay the date and severity of my impending stroke.â€
â€œItâ€™s so sad you donâ€™t see the gym as a fun place.â€
â€œWell, I donâ€™t, Cindy, and I think, at my age, I think I know whatâ€™s fun to me, and I think I know whatâ€™s not fun to me. A bar is fun to me. Trust me, year after year, I reprove it and reprove it. I really have a lot of fun at a bar. A gym, no. No, no.â€
Iâ€™ve never stayed at a gym so long, I got kicked out. Never. I never worked out so hard, somebody had to take my keys â€™cause I was crazy.
No. No, no. I donâ€™t have good habits. I donâ€™t. I have changed my diet none whatsoever since I was a kid. I still drink whole milk every day. Thatâ€™s weird in a lot of places now. Like, even inâ€¦ I went in Starbucks, and the kidâ€™s really nice, and I know they have whole milk â€™cause itâ€™s in a silver container and it says â€œwhole milk,â€ and thereâ€™s one right next to it that says â€œskim.â€ Itâ€™s for your coffee, but theyâ€™re not selling whole milk, and I said to the kid, I go, â€œI know this might sound weird, â€œbut if I gave you money, would you give me some milk?â€ And he goesâ€¦ â€œWould you like to try our soy milk?â€ I said, â€œI donâ€™t know. â€œI went to bed at 11:00 last night, â€œand I didnâ€™t watch the news, â€œand youâ€™re the first person Iâ€™ve spoken to â€œsince I woke up today. â€œWhile I was asleep, did all the cows in the world die?â€ â€œBecause if so, â€œI would like to try your soy milk. â€œIf not, I do not understand why that was thrown out as an alternative to my original request.â€ If you want to feel better about your health and you want to feel like a really in-shape, healthy person, even if youâ€™re not, go on a cruise ship for a week. Lot of drinkers and eaters on those ships. Itâ€™ll drink and eat you into feeling great. Iâ€¦ wow. I had never been on a cruise ship, ever, and Lewis black booked a comedy cruise and made me go. And I got to Miami. Iâ€™d never even seen a cruise ship up close. Theyâ€™re humungous. It holds 4,000 people. Itâ€™s gigantic. My sister goes, â€œwhat was it like? Maybe me and Matt will go.â€ I go, â€œhereâ€™s what it was like. â€œPicture if we were all in Las Vegas, â€œstanding in the Bellagio, and all of a sudden, it just sailed away.â€ Yeah. Yeah, the whole building, and nobody panicked or acted weird. Theyâ€™re like, â€œsee you, bye!â€ â€œHey, want to try a monkey-ass rum punch?â€ â€œYes. I love monkey, and I love punch.â€ Seven monkey rum punches later, you hear, â€œand now we will be doing the safety drill.â€ What? What? Iâ€™m hammered. We canâ€™t do a safety drill. â€œIt is on your muster station, â€œwhich is located on the back of your key card. It will not match your deck or room, so please payâ€¦â€ What, what, what, what? Now thereâ€™s math involved? This is a terrible vacation. Thereâ€™s no math on vacation. I finally found my room, and I was next to these lovely people from Wisconsin, and they had balloons all over their door, and I was like, â€œhey, is it somebodyâ€™s birthday or anniversary?â€ And the guy goes, â€œno. â€œWe just get so hammered on these ships, and these rooms all look alike, so we decorate our door.â€ â€œAnd the good news for you, sweetheart, is, â€œevery time you find this door, you got a 50-50 chance of finding your room.â€ Yes, I do, Mr. Milwaukee. You are my new best friend. Donâ€™t tell me alcoholics are lazy. Look at that energy. He had to get tape, balloons. He had to stop smoking for four seconds to blow them up. Thereâ€™s a lot of activities. Yeah. You get on the ship, and thereâ€™s this giant, neon board. It looks like a Vegas sports-betting board. Youâ€™re like! This is totally overwhelming. Youâ€™re like, â€œthat looks fun, that looks fun.â€ Well, if youâ€™re a sleeper-inner or a drinker-later, you will not be involved in any of these activities, because these will require you to be up at 6:00 A.M. With a Fanny pack on, ready to jump in some dinghy with your new friends from buffalo, and, no. My friend shay wanted to do it all, and Iâ€™m like, â€œno. â€œI am not getting up at 6:00 A.M. â€œTo go to stingray village. â€œI donâ€™t have it in me. â€œIf someone puts the stingrays in my bathtub, â€œI will pet them, but I am notâ€¦ â€œIâ€™m not doing that. I donâ€™t care enough.â€ Her and her husband, Mike, they did every activity. â€œYou sure?â€ And sheâ€™d check back in. â€œYou sure, Kathleen? Tomorrow weâ€™re going to zipline through the Mexican jungle.â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™m sure. â€œThere is nothing I could think of â€œthat would make me projectile-vomit more quickly â€œthan to be hot and hung over â€œand shot through a Mexican jungle on a rubber band. â€œNo, no, Iâ€™m good. â€œI am good right here on this chair â€œwith my monkey-ass rum punch. â€œAnd you know what? â€œYou can call me crazy, shay, â€œbut I question the safety of that apparatus. I truly do.â€ â€œNo, no, no. They make you sign a form.â€ Really? What form? Who made those up? Juan and Julio in the Van that wonâ€™t be there when you come back with your flesh-eating bacteria wound that thereâ€™s not hospital around? Hope you have a good time with the ship doctor getting your bacteria-eaten leg fixed up. If youâ€™re a drinker or a sleeper-inner, your activity adventure will consist of getting off that ship at about noon, into some sad, little Mexican town, where youâ€™re gonna hear a guy in an alley goâ€¦ â€œPsst, psst!â€ And you donâ€™t know why, but youâ€™re gonna go over to that guy â€™cause you want to hear what he has to offer. And youâ€™re gonna go over there, and heâ€™s gonna show you a clipboard with pictures of pretty fish, and heâ€™s gonna tell you he can take you snorkeling there for $20, and youâ€™re gonna say, â€œ$10.â€ You donâ€™t know why you wouldâ€™ve said that, and then heâ€™s gonna say â€œ$15,â€ and the next thing you know, youâ€™re gonna be on a rickety-ass partridge family bus going to Christ knows where. Because thatâ€™s when lew got the maddest heâ€™s ever been at me, because we were the only two that agreed to this adventure. He was like, â€œthis is stupid. â€œThis is the stupidest thing youâ€™ve ever talked me into. â€œWe donâ€™t know who the fuck that man is. We donâ€™t know where this bus is really going.â€ I said, â€œI know, lew. â€œThatâ€™s why this is a real adventure. â€œThose people on that royal Caribbean ship know exactly what time theyâ€™re coming back tonight.â€ â€œWe may never come back tonight, lew. â€œDo you understand the level of excitement â€œI have provided for $15 a man? Come on.â€ The worst thing about a cruise ship, though, is they have a TV channel on yourâ€¦ A little boat channel, and in the afternoons, when I first turned it on, itâ€™s a picture of where you are in the ocean, â€™cause thereâ€™s cameras on the outside of the boat, and you go, â€œisnâ€™t that lovely?â€ Itâ€™s just the sea and nice spa music, but in the morning, no. When you turn that channel on, itâ€™s not the lovely ocean with spa music. Itâ€™s a picture of your bill from the day before. Right. How mean is that? What kind of buzz kill is that? This is vacation. I donâ€™t need to review my bad behavior on a daily basis. What kind of sadist is running this ship? That is horrible. All that can wait till sad sunday, when itâ€™s check-out time, and I see the bill, and I go, â€œmy god!â€ And then I become alarmed, and I have that conversation that I seem to have with myself about once a year, when I see it on paper. I go, â€œholy Jesus Christ. I think youâ€™re an alcoholic.â€ â€œHey, hey, shh shh shh shh shh shh shh. â€œHey, it was vacation. â€œYeah, you bought drinks â€œfor those nice people from buffalo. The drinks were overpriced.â€ â€œI think you need to take that alcoholic test online.â€ â€œDonâ€™t you dare. â€œDonâ€™t you dare. â€œItâ€™s all true or false. â€œYouâ€™ve never done well on true and false. â€œYou always guess wrong. â€œThey donâ€™t let you explain anything. â€œThe world is black and white to those people. â€œThe world is not a black-and-white place. â€œThe world has gray areas. â€œQuestion number four, exampleâ€¦ â€˜Do you drink at home alone?'â€ â€œtrue.â€ â€œHoweverâ€¦ â€œI used to go out and drink with my friends at bars, â€œand then they said I couldnâ€™t drink and drive, â€œso now I stay home sometimes â€œand drink and watch â€˜shark week.â€™ â€œso, am I an alcoholic, â€œor am I just a really good citizen who loves America? I love America!â€ Thank you. Good night. Thatâ€™s it for me, guys. Cheers. Thank you so much. And I have a present for you. Yeah? Yeah? You haveâ€¦? Yeah. Iâ€™m terribly sorry. Itâ€™s the best I could do. At the last moment, sheâ€¦ Itâ€™s all ones. Itâ€™s all ones. Itâ€™s all ones. Yeah. So, we could either take care of a check, or we could head down to 8 mile. I think, wherever you think. Wherever, you know, we can make it rain. We have all night left. And Iâ€™ve never said that. Anywhere, anytime. Itâ€™s where I want to beâ€¦ On a horse going down to plutoâ€¦ Where theyâ€™re looking at the starsâ€¦ Dancing on saturnâ€¦ Iâ€™ll go everywhere with youâ€¦ Nah nah nah nah nah nahâ€¦ Nah nah nah nah nahâ€¦ Take me to Atlantisâ€¦ Thatâ€™s where I want to beâ€¦ Nah nah nah nah nah nahâ€¦ Nah nah nah nah nahâ€¦ Yeah.

[hip-hop music playing]
[audience cheering and applauding]
[music stops]
All right!
[cheering and applauding continue]
Wow. So nice! Oh, wow. Gosh, thatâ€™s wayâ€¦ Come on, now. Please. That isâ€¦ That is so nice. Keep going forever.
[laughs]
Look at this. Here we are. London Palladium. My gosh.
[cheering]
Thank you so much for coming out. Oh, my days. Oh. Let me put this away. The biggest stage in the world so Iâ€™ll be back in about half an hour.
Guys, thank you so much for coming out tonight. I really appreciate it. Here we are. Itâ€™s taken a few more months longer than expected, but here we are. Look at this, a sold-out, reduced capacity, London Palladium!
[laughing and cheering]
Oh, my gosh. Oh, man. Thank you so much for coming.
So we were meant to film this last year. We were meant to film this in May of 2020. But something came up. We had to push it back. But we made it. Here we are. Weâ€™re finally doing it. I canâ€™t wait to do the show. I hope it is all still relevant.
This show is about Brexit and how much I want to meet Prince Philip. Letâ€™s go! Letâ€™s do it! Should be good, should be fun.
[applause]
Iâ€™m Phil Wang, in case you didnâ€™t know. Here I am. Old Philly Philly Wang Wang. Here at last. Old Philly Philly Wang Wang at the London Phalladium.
So good to be here. Phil Wang. Uh, Iâ€™m a mixed race fella. As the name â€œPhil Wangâ€ might suggest. At some point here, a cultural compromise was made. Yes, well, my father is a Chinese Malaysian, hence the â€œWang.â€ And the rest of my body. My father is Chinese Malaysian, uh, but my mother is, uh, normal. So, yeah, got some sour cream in that chili.
[laughs]
Didnâ€™t want you to burn your tongue on that hot Wang, so Mama brought the milk.
White and Chinese, those are my races. White and Chinese. Phil and Wang. White and Chinese. Iâ€™m the most powerful race on Earth! I got the big ones, baby! Smoosh them together. Iâ€™m white and Chinese. People have tried to tell me that Iâ€™m a minority.
[laughs]
Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m both majorities, bitch. Iâ€™m white and Chinese.â€
[laughing and applauding]
You canâ€™t touch me. Iâ€™m Pepsi and Coke. Iâ€™m like a full market share. They sell Wang everywhere. Iâ€™m white and Chinese. Iâ€™m everywhere. You canâ€™t run from me. Iâ€™m around every corner. Hello. Ni hao. Iâ€™m Alien and Predator. Iâ€™m white and Chinese. Iâ€™m future-proof, baby. Completely future-proof. No matter what happens over the next 50 years, Wang, or Phil, is fine.
[laughs]
Probably Wang, though.
[laughs]
The way things are going.
Itâ€™s weird looking like me at the moment. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, itâ€™s weird looking like me. Uh, Chinese, not muscular. Itâ€™s weird looking Chinese at the moment. This whole pandemic, itâ€™s been bad for the brand, to say the least. Honestly, the last thing we needed, especially in the UK. The last thing East Asian Chinese Brits needed. East Asian Brits, East Asians in Britain, very low profile in the UK. So low, in fact, that we donâ€™t even have the word â€œAsianâ€ here. Most places in the world, we at least have the word â€œAsian.â€ Not in the UK. In the UK, the word â€œAsian,â€ usually refers to South Asian, right? Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi. Which is fine. But thereâ€™s this whole other half of Asia theyâ€™re missing out on. A whole other, I would say, bigger half.
[laughs]
Thereâ€™s a whole other half of Asia missing out there. Thereâ€™s two types of Asian in the world. Thereâ€™s more, but I donâ€™t have that much time. Fundamentally, there are two main categories of Asian in the world. Thereâ€™s Cricket Asian.
[laughs]
By the sounds of it, you already know who those guys are. Youâ€™ve never heard â€œCricket Asianâ€ in your life and instantly you knew who I was talking about. So thereâ€™s Cricket Asian, and then thereâ€™s Eats-Weird-Shit Asian.
[laughs]
Now, I am a member of Eats-Weird-Shit Asian. Iâ€™m a proud Eats-Weird-Shit Asian. I eats that weird shit. But itâ€™s kind of awkward being an Eats-Weird-Shit Asian at the moment â€™cause thatâ€™s how this whole catastrophe started in the first place.
[laughs]
One of us ate one piece of weird shit too far. After centuries of living on the wild side, we pushed our luck and it finally snapped on the wings of a bat. Itâ€™s awful. Why now? Itâ€™s always been fine up till now. I ate weird shit as a kid. Nothing like this ever happened. Growing up in Malaysia, I was eating weird shit. Loved it. Loved eating weird shit. I would eat, like, uh, squid jerky. [growls] I was eating little wriggly sea snails, straight out of the shell. Mmm. I was eating jellyfish. I was eating pig intestine soup. Uh, weâ€™d eat the whole fish for dinner. Whole fish. My little sister would go, â€œShotgun, the eyes!â€ Me and my other sister would be like, â€œNaw!â€
Itâ€™s just a different culture out there. In the West, people are a little squeamish about the more extreme ends of the culinary spectrum. Out in the East, thereâ€™s a sense of delicacy to the strange. Nowhere more so than China. China itself. I got to see this firsthand in China recently. Went there for the first time. China. The big C. Asia Classic.
[laughs]
Chinatown Plus. China. At the start of 2020, I got to go to China. Unrelated, it wasnâ€™t me.
[audience laughs]
Awkward timing, in retrospect, but it wasnâ€™t me. I got to go to China for a job, and while I was out there, I got to go to a food market. Not sounding good, Iâ€™ll give you that. I got to go to a food market out there in China. And they were selling all sorts of Chinese snacks. Thereâ€™s stalls selling noodles, some selling buns, blah, blah, blah. But there was one stall that was dedicated to weird pieces of shit. Critters, essentially. Deep-fried, roasted critters. Bugs. Locusts. There was a lizard, on a stick, just dried like: Crucified lizard, like this. People would walk past and go, â€œOh, Iâ€™ll have the Jesus lizard, please.â€ Uh, â€œOne Passion of the Lizard, thank you.â€
[laughs]
There were snakes curled up like sausages with a spike through them. I partook, sure! I ate a full tarantula on a stick. Like that. Tried to do it in two halves, surprisingly tough, tarantula. So I had to just down it in one. Like a legend.
[laughs]
I ate a centipede. Good thing about a centipede, plenty of drumsticks for everyone.
[laughs]
I ate a couple of roasted cockroaches. But theyâ€™re resilient, cockroaches. Crawled out of my butt. Theyâ€™re gonna inherit the world.
Itâ€™s just a cultural thing. A cultural difference. Like, in the West, you know that nursery rhyme, I know an old lady who swallowed a fly I donâ€™t know why she swallowed a fly Perhaps sheâ€™ll die Itâ€™s a banger.
[laughs]
And in this nursery rhyme, this old lady goes on to eat increasingly large animals to catch the previous animal she ingested, which she now regrets having inside her. First she swallows a fly, by accident. Then she swallows a spiderâ€¦ I know what thatâ€™s like.
â€¦to catch the fly. Then she swallows a bird to catch the spider, then a cat to catch the bird, then a dog to catch the cat, then a horse to catch the dog.
Now, in the West, this nursery rhyme is a cautionary taleâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦about how sometimes the solution can be worse than the problem. In China, this is a Michelin star tasting menuâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦with an admittedly heavy dessert, horse!
[laughs]
Oof. â€œWeâ€™ll just have the one. Two spoons, thank you.â€
Itâ€™s just a cultural difference. But no reason we should get that there racism because of it. That there COVID racism? I donâ€™t want that there COVID racism, no thank you. Iâ€™m terrified of that there COVID racism. I donâ€™t want to get that on me. Terrified. Even at home alone, â€œOh!â€ I hear a noise, Iâ€™m like, â€œRacism?â€ â€œDid I leave a window open? Did racism get in?â€
Just me and my devices at home, aloneâ€¦ Even my devices I donâ€™t trust. My devices are racist now. My phone especially. I think my phone is definitely racist. I was on my phone the other day, and I typed the word, uh, â€œNazisâ€ into my phone, right? You donâ€™t need to know why.
[laughs]
I typed the word â€œNazisâ€ into my phone. All lowercase, right, n-a-z-i-s, all lowercase. I was in a hurry. You know what sextingâ€™s like.
[laughs]
You gotta be quick. The vibeâ€™s not gonna last forever. So I typed into my phone, n-a-z-i-s, all lowercase. And then instantly, my phone autocorrected it to replace the â€œnâ€ at the beginning with a capital â€œNâ€ as if to say, â€œOi! Show some goddamn respect.
[laughs]
Those are Nazis youâ€™re talking aboutâ€¦ Phil Wand.â€
[laughs]
I got a far-right phone that thinks Iâ€™m a creepy magician. Terrible.
Scary times. Not the scariest times weâ€™ve lived through. Not really the most dangerous times weâ€™ve lived through. But itâ€™s the abstract nature of this new danger that has driven us insane. Itâ€™s so abstract. Itâ€™s an invisible virus. So abstract, some of us donâ€™t even believe itâ€™s real. Threat and danger have become more abstract as the 21st centuryâ€™s progressed. With it, weâ€™ve been becoming more insane. At the start of this century, threat and danger were very real, physical, tangible things, you know? After 9/11, War on Terror, back then, the threat, the thing that we were all told to look out for was just a guy, covered in bombsâ€¦ who would come in and go: [yells] â€œIâ€™m covered in bombs, everyone! Iâ€™m covered in bombs and I love it, to be frank!â€
[laughs]
Weâ€™d see him and go, â€œOkay, Iâ€™ll stay away from that guy.â€ Problem solved. Clear, tangible threat.
Then threats started getting abstract. The next thing we were all told to look for was unattended packages. Remember unattended packages? I long for the day of the unattended package. We were obsessed with unattended packages for a while. Mid-noughties, golden age of the unattended package. All we cared about back then, unattended packages and Malcolm in the Middle. Now there were just packages out there. There wasnâ€™t even a guy involved. Now there were just packages out there, and it was down to us to assess each oneâ€™s level of attendance.
[laughs]
Responsibility had shifted onto the public. We all still had our lives to live, but now weâ€™d been burdened with a new unpaid second job of being bag spotters! Weâ€™d try our best, but it was terrifying. Weâ€™d go out, living our mid-noughties lives, down the library or the cyber cafeâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦and from time to time, weâ€™d see a backpack just lying on the ground. And weâ€™d freak out! Weâ€™d go, [yells] â€œItâ€™s a package!â€ â€œAnd itâ€™s unattended!â€ â€œQuick! Someone attend it!â€ Then someone would run over, [panting] weâ€™d be like, â€œPhew. That was close.â€
[laughs]
But then threat got more abstract still. Then with the Internet, as life moved online, the thing we were told to look out for were bots and hackers and Russians. Then we found out none of them could tick a box that says â€œIâ€™m not a robot.â€ That seemed to solve the problem.
[laughs]
Now with the coronavirus, threat is the most abstract itâ€™s ever been. Now threat is like a surface.
[laughs]
â€œBe careful of a surface, everyone.â€ â€œNo, you should be fine, as long as you steer clear of them surfaces. Theyâ€™ll get you.â€ Awful to find out, home alone, watching the news. â€œOh, shit, surfaces!â€ I did a quick scan of my flat. Fucking surfaces everywhere! Death trap, that place! Didnâ€™t realize I was living in Saw III.
Even now Iâ€™m terrified. My friends are like, â€œWanna come over, have dinner in the garden?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œUh, maybe. Could you check quicklyâ€¦ Do you have any surfaces over there?
[laughs]
What are we having dinner on? A table? Are you trying to kill me? Youâ€™re out of the bubble, buddy.â€
[laughs]
Scary times, man. Iâ€™m getting more scared. Getting older. Maybe you get more fearful as you age. Getting older. Thatâ€™s scary itself, getting older. Holy shit, I thought Iâ€™d at least have this year off. No. Older again. So fucking old now, man. I became so old this year. Donâ€™t know about you guys, but I became older recently. Became so old this year. Broke my personal record, actually. Became so old. I turned 31 this year. Bleh!
[jeers]
I know. Disgusting. Yes, youâ€™re right. Iâ€™m gonna be sick. Bleh! So old. Thirty-freaking-one. I went into lockdown 19 years old. Now Iâ€™m 31. Terrible.
[laughs]
Awful. So fucking old. Thirty-one. This shitâ€™s nearly over, folks. This is my farewell special, by the way. Oh, my God. Knockinâ€™ on hellâ€™s door over here. Iâ€™m 31. Iâ€™m so old. Uh, this may annoy some people.
[laughs]
I come onstage and I say, â€œIâ€™m 31, Iâ€™m so old.â€ Thereâ€™s always a couple of people in the crowd, like, â€œOh, 31â€™s not old. Oh, shut up, 31â€™s nothing. Youâ€™re a baby. Turning 31. Pfft. Give me a break!â€ But theyâ€™re always really fucking old, soâ€¦
[laughs]
Doesnâ€™t make me feel better.
[applause]
Theyâ€™re like 43 and shit. I donâ€™t care.
[laughs]
Forgive me if I take no comfort from the jealous face of death itself. Mr. Magoo and Maggie Smith think Iâ€™m a spring chicken. Oh, great.
[laughs]
I know 31â€™s not, like, â€œoldâ€ old. But itâ€™s not â€œyoungâ€ young anymore either. It doesnâ€™t fizz with the excitement of the twenties. Thirty-oneâ€™s a pretty serious age. One of the first serious ages. Life starts to ossify at 31. Shit starts to get serious. People start committing to things long-term. Iâ€™ve got to that age now where all my friends have started having, uh, podcasts.
[laughs]
So I had to have one too, to keep up with the crowd. But I wasnâ€™t ready.
My bodyâ€™s falling apart. Bodyâ€™s giving up the fucking ghost, man. Crumbling into a disgusting paste, this body. Awful. Gets worse and worse every day. Every morning I wake up to a new leak on this ship.
It doesnâ€™t even make sense anymore, the shit that goes wrong with my body. It used to make sense. Back in the day, Iâ€™d stub my toe, then my toe would hurt. It was a clear line of cause and effect.
[laughs]
Now, my body skips the first step. Just straight to pain, unexplained. I just go, â€œOh, why?â€ And my bodyâ€™s like, â€œFuck you, thatâ€™s why.â€
[laughs]
Itâ€™s improvising now, my body. Itâ€™s gone full jazz. Doesnâ€™t have to make sense at all. Like, the other day I woke up, and one of my balls hurt. It just hurt. I didnâ€™t do anything to it. I didnâ€™t deserve that. I didnâ€™t go to bed the night before like: [sighs, then grunts] Now Iâ€™m relaxed. I didnâ€™t do that. But still, just one painful ball in the morning. Just exhausted by a long nightâ€™s sleep, I guess.
[laughs]
Thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m at now. Tired by rest.
Iâ€™ve got a bad back. Thirty-one, backâ€™s a-crackinâ€™. My memoryâ€™s not what it used to be. Or maybe it is. I have no way of knowing.
[laughs]
Maybe itâ€™s the same and I forgot.
My farts are disgusting now. My farts are so bad. I thought my farts were bad before. Pfft. Ha! If only young Wang knewâ€¦
â™ª What fragrant days he lived in â™ª
â™ª I should have savored them While I had the chance â™ª
Ah!
Now my farts are revolting.
[laughs]
Absolutely disgusting, my farts now. Theyâ€™re quieter now, Iâ€™ll give them that. My farts are quieter now. But theyâ€™re worse. For you.
[laughs]
My young farts were loud and ostentatious. But, ultimately, kind on the nose. They werenâ€™t interested in hurting anyone, my young farts. They were in it for the show, really, my young farts. They were like fireworks, my young farts.
[mimics fireworks]
Then Chinese people would come. â€œYeah.
[laughs]
Good luck. Good luck for the coming year.â€
[laughs]
Now my farts are like the silent leaking of an abandoned chemical factory. Just slowly poisoning the groundwater.
[laughs]
Killing the local dogs. Itâ€™s terrible. Terrible, my farts are. Theyâ€™re absolutely disgusting, so bad.
Have you ever done a fart so bad that you, uh, lost a bar of Wi-Fi?
[laughs]
I swear the other dayâ€¦ Swear to God, I was at home and I let one rip and [blows raspberry] Netflix got blurry for a bit. You know when itâ€™s like, it gets the squares. â€œCome on!â€
[laughs]
Bodyâ€™s changing, I guess. Bodyâ€™s changing. Thirty-one, my bodyâ€™s changing. My mindâ€™s changing. My soulâ€™s changing. My personalityâ€™s changed a lot. My opinions. My political persuasionâ€™s changed. So much from a couple years ago. I used to think I was a Socialist. That was me. Just a couple of years ago. Little Philly Philly Wang Wang with his red cap on.
[laughs]
â€œMm! Iâ€™m a Socialist. Boo-boo-boo. A little bit for everyone. It only seems fair.
[laughs]
Boo-boo-boo. Nationalize the sea. Oh, Iâ€™m a Socialist.â€
[laughs]
But looking back now, I realize I just didnâ€™t have money.
[laughs]
I have money now. Iâ€™m not sharing that shit! Thatâ€™s mine! Back off, you dirty Commies!
[laughs]
Wang made that pound.
[laughs]
Turns out capitalismâ€™s okay when you got, uh, capital.
[laughs]
The clue was in the name the whole time.
I just want to be rich now. I used to want world peace and now I just want to be fucking minted.
And I know thatâ€™s not a very meaningful pursuit, money for its own sake. But honesty is a meaningful pursuit. And if Iâ€™m being honest, I just want to be loaded. I just wanna be rich. I mean, Iâ€™m already rich. Weâ€™re all rich, technically speaking. By global standards, everyone in this room is fucking Bezos. Everyone in this room is Nebuchadnezzar by global standards. I donâ€™t give a shit about global standards. Have you been to the globe?
[laughs]
The globe is filthy. We donâ€™t live in the globe. We live in the UK. On the edge of the world, looking in, tutting. I donâ€™t wanna be globe-rich. Thatâ€™s like 10 pounds. I donâ€™t wanna be globe-rich. I wanna be proper rich. I want to be UK rich. And not just for the big, obvious things. Not the cars, houses, killing people and getting away with it.
[laughs]
Thatâ€™s all lovely, sure. But itâ€™s the little things that I want to be rich for. The little touches that make being rich wonderful. Like, I wanna send a bottle of champagne across a restaurant to an acquaintance who hasnâ€™t noticed Iâ€™m there yet.
[laughs]
Mwah!
Thatâ€™s some sweet rich-person-only shit. Iâ€™ve seen that in the films and Wang wants in. Theyâ€™re over there, all sad on their own, eating their fish, and they ainâ€™t got no champagne. Out of nowhere, the waiter pops up. â€œOh, this is from the gentleman over there in the rabbit onesie.â€
[laughs]
Iâ€™m rich! I can wear what I like! Youâ€™ve not seen opulence till youâ€™ve seen a full-grown man doff an earâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦across a crowded Bella Italia.
[laughs]
Mm. Mwah! Ooh, la, la. Itâ€™d certainly impress my date.
Iâ€™m back on the dating scene now.
[whooping]
Single once more. Ah, yes.
[laughs]
Single fella, single now. Broke up with my girlfriend. Great way to become single. Highly effective, it turns out. So once more, dating. Dating too much, man. Dating way too much. Dating too much. Dating far too much. Chasing my tail with all the dating. Running in this mirage of happiness that keeps receding further into the horizon. Iâ€™m trying to make up for something with all this dating. Iâ€™m trying to make up for what I perceive to have been a rather, uh, sexless youth. You know? I mean, not childhood. Probably for the best, whatever.
[laughs]
But later. Like late teens, early twenties. That time in your life when youâ€™re supposed to get it out of your system. Just get on your knees, batten down the hatches and just fuckinâ€™â€¦
[laughs]
Just experiment! Fucking yeah! Just fuck your way to clarity.
[laughs]
Move on, get a job, buy a sensible hatchback.
I never did that. I never made the most of those opportunities. University, the big one. I didnâ€™t really have sex at university. Uh, for religious reasons. Uh, God hates me.
[laughs]
Iâ€™ve been trying to make up for it. Iâ€™ve been trying to pay back this sexual deficit I feel I incurred. This sexual debt upon which I have imposed my own rate of interest that I cannot keep up with. Deep in with the Wang Bank over here.
[laughs]
Sure, the occasional repayment is fun enough, but itâ€™s not a tenable way to live.
Iâ€™m on the old dating apps too. On the old apps. Gotta get on the apps. That can be a depressing venture. I discovered pits of desperation I did not know I was low enough to crawl into, on the dating apps.
Like, have you ever swiped right on a group photoâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦not knowing which one of them it is, just, â€œYeah, any of them. Yeah, whatever. Iâ€™ll date anyone who can afford that ski trip.â€
[laughs]
Thereâ€™s a Labrador in there. â€œIâ€™ll take the dog, whatever. Heâ€™s got a healthy coat.â€
Beggars canâ€™t be choosers, I suppose, and East Asian guys, we have a difficult time on the dating apps. This is a documented phenomenon. East Asian men have the hardest time on dating apps of any group. In the West. I think in, like, Korea, theyâ€™re fine.
[laughs]
But in the West, East Asian men, Chinese men, weâ€™re rarely considered viable, sexual options. Itâ€™s not how weâ€™re portrayed in public culture, in media. Weâ€™re never really the sexy guys. Usually weâ€™re portrayed as these sort of gormless, bucktooth fools who are primarily asexual. Like, completely uninterested in sex. Which is mad, considering how many Chinese people there are.
[laughs]
1.4 billion people, thatâ€™s with the one-child policy. We fuck so good they had to give us a rule.
[laughs]
[applauding and whooping]
No one else got a rule.
But still, you know, these negative perceptions persist. But I understand. Iâ€™m not angry about it. A cultureâ€™s aesthetic tastes, its beauty standards, are a difficult thing to shift, informed by many things. What a society finds beautiful is informed by its own cultural makeup, itâ€™s informed by its literature, its language and its poetry. And sometimes I think the English language just isnâ€™t equipped to fully appreciate East Asian male beauty.
[laughs]
For example, we have very dark eyes, right? East Asian guys have very dark eyes. Some of us have very dark eyes. Some of us have black eyes. Coal-black eyes of a snake.
I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve tried, but itâ€™s very difficult to be romantic, in English, at least, about black eyes. If you have blue eyes, green eyes, good for you, that shitâ€™s easy.
[laughs]
â€œOh, you have green eyes! Like the purest emerald. Oh! Oh, you have blue eyes. When I look in your eyes, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m swimming in the ocean. Oh!â€ Whatever.
Black eyes. What can you say about black eyes? â€œOh, you have black eyes. They remind me of death.
[laughs]
They are like the endless abyss. When I look in your eyes, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m closing my eyes.â€
[laughs]
Still, I guess I do all right. Umâ€¦ Iâ€™ve dated some lovely ladies. Got no kids to show for it, as a bonus. No kids. No-child policy over here.
[laughs]
I donâ€™t have any kids. My ex, she was on the old contraceptives. Yeah, a couple of fans in? Big fan of the contraceptives. Grateful to my ex for being on contraceptives. Grateful to all you ladies, for being on the old contraceptives.
[women whooping]
Thank you very much, yes. On behalf of the fellas, cheers.
[laughs]
Appreciate it. Youâ€™ve been taking one for the team for a while. Not gone unnoticed.
[laughs]
Youâ€™re doing great work. Keep it up. And itâ€™s not fair that you ladies have to do most of it still. â€˜Cause itâ€™s not like male equivalents havenâ€™t been developed. They have! We just havenâ€™t told ya.
[laughs]
Weâ€™re sneaky like that, us guys. Itâ€™s why you love us. They have. They made a male pill a couple years ago. They came up with a contraceptive pill for men. But the test subjects found that it actually sort of altered their body chemistry. Made them feel a bit sad.
[laughs]
So they all wentâ€¦ â€œHmâ€¦ Must not be ready yet.
[laughs]
Women can keep using their pill, which we presume is perfect by now.â€
A mechanical solution was developed for the guys. A little cork device that they justâ€¦ Right there. Right there. The equivalent of the coil. Right there. Cork and the Coil. Thereâ€™s a kids book. Right there. Just a little cork they put right there. Brute force approach, it worked. Right there. A little cork they put up there in the tube. Itâ€™ll just sit up there and stop the swimmers getting through. Just like a hard border. Right there. Just like putting a difficult immigrations officer up inside.
[laughs]
â€œThese passports are expired!â€ Theyâ€™ll have to swim back and: â€œAwâ€¦â€
[laughs]
I do quite a good sperm impression. I donâ€™t know why. Iâ€™m half sperm. Yeah.
[laughs]
Uh, dadâ€™s side, if youâ€™re wondering.
But again, men found that procedure a little invasive, soâ€¦ They went, â€œUh, women can keep using the implant for now.â€
Itâ€™s not fair. Itâ€™s not fair, ladies. I appreciate that, and, men, we should help. We should help carry that burden. Share the load. Pardon the pun.
[laughs]
But thereâ€™s an intractable problem with male contraception. Which no one in the industry seems to be talking about. An intractable problem with male contraception, which is that, even if a guy were to get these things done to him, with the best of intentions, what woman is going to believe him?
[laughs]
Right? Thereâ€™s a lot of trust that goes with unseen contraception. A lot of jeopardy. None of the jeopardy falls on the manâ€™s side. You know? A lady gets pregnant, she deals with it. The guy, he can just fuck off. I mean, you shouldnâ€™t.
[laughs]
You shouldnâ€™t, fellas. You shouldnâ€™t. But you totally can. But you shouldnâ€™t!
[laughs]
You mustnâ€™tâ€¦ Donâ€™t! But itâ€™s very easy. But you shouldnâ€™t! But you must refrain. But flights are so cheap now. But you shouldnâ€™t!
[laughs]
You can get the Belgian passport on the dark web. Know that? Full Belgian passport.
[laughs]
Different name, new address. But you shouldnâ€™t! But the optionâ€™s always open to you.
If youâ€™re a lady, you gotta deal with that shit. The guy, you donâ€™t really. Which is why we donâ€™t need convincing a ladyâ€™s sorted out with contraceptives. You can make shit up, ladies. Have fun with it. Could be like, â€œOh, yeah, a magical squirrel put a curse on me once, and, uh, now I cannot bear child.â€
[laughs]
And even a smart guy would be like, â€œYeah, I think I read that. Yeah, sure. Letâ€™s do it.â€
It doesnâ€™t work the other way around. Say all these male contraceptives come on the market. I go down to the clinic. Get tooled up. And I go out on the town. Take it for a spin.
[laughs]
Then I go to a bar, chat up a girl. Sheâ€™s into it for some reason. Maybe sheâ€™s sick.
[laughs]
We go back to my place. We start kissing. Sure, why not? Itâ€™s 2021, keep up. We start kissing. We get a little bit less-than-clothed. A little nakey-nu, as they say in France. Andâ€¦ just before we get down and dirty, she goes, â€œOoh, you have any protection?â€ And I just go, â€œDonâ€™t worry, baby. Wangâ€™s on the pill.
[laughs]
Who, me? I got a cork in my balls! I know youâ€™ve never heard of it, but trust me! The man you met at All Bar One.
[laughs]
I got a cork in my balls! Put â€™em in the sink. Theyâ€™ll float, youâ€™ll see.â€
[laughs]
Thatâ€™d never work. I need a doctorâ€™s note from the UN for that shit! Iâ€™d need Malala to sign it. â€œHeâ€™s got a cork in his balls. I am Malala.â€
Iâ€™d love a cork in my balls. You kiddinâ€™? Oh! Iâ€™d love a cork in my balls! London Palladium, if you take nothing else from this showâ€¦ And you wonâ€™t.
[laughs]
â€¦please remember Phil would love a cork in his balls! Can you imagine the peace of mind that must come with having a cork in your balls?
[laughs]
Oh! Iâ€™d just swan about town, making love, not a care in the world with a cork in my balls. When I do meet the one and want to settle down, I just pop that shit like champagne.
[laughs]
Across a crowded Bella Italia.
[laughing and applauding]
Thank you.
Love aâ€¦ Iâ€™d love a cork in my balls. Iâ€™d love a cork in my balls. I would absolutely love a cork in my balls.
I wouldnâ€™t want the pill. I donâ€™t want to be on the male pill.
I donâ€™t want another thing to remember to do.
I got enough shit in my routine. Thatâ€™s the most impressive one, the pill.
Iâ€™m in so much admiration for women on the pill.
Thatâ€™s the most badass one. It requires the most of you.
The discipline. The determination.
The strength of character.
The memory, just the memory!
You have to remember to do it every day. Itâ€™s gotta be hard.
No matter what, you gotta remember every day.
Itâ€™s gotta be difficult. Especially if youâ€™re not getting any at the time.
Brief moment of candor, ladies,
but thatâ€™s gotta be a kick to the old soul thereâ€¦
[laughs]
if youâ€™re a sister going through a dry patchâ€¦
and you still gotta pop the old sex pill every day.
Thatâ€™s a bit of a taunt, isnâ€™t it?
[laughs]
Every day. Think of what that is. If youâ€™re not having sex at the time,
being on the contraceptive pill, that is a daily,
oral reminder
of your own squandered sexual potential.
Every day just a gulp of loneliness with breakfast.
[groans] Every day.
Only women are emotionally strong enough to persist with something like that.
Can you imagine if guys had to do anything like that?
We wouldnâ€™t last a week!
Can you imagine if guys had to get up every morning, just crawl out of bed,
and just strap on a condom every morning?
Just likeâ€¦ [whimpers]
â€œMaybe today.
[laughs]
Hopefully. [whines]â€
Just rolls it up his flaccid penis.
[whining]
[laughs]
Pulls up his trousers and goes to work with his condom on.
[groaning]
[laughs]
It rides down all day like a tube top. Heâ€™s gotta keep pullingâ€¦
[laughs]
Distracts him at work. [groans]
â€œAndy, are you all right?â€ â€œSorry, itâ€™s justâ€¦â€
â€œYouâ€™re fired.â€ â€œOh, no.â€
He goes out clubbing that night. â€œYeah. Oh, no.â€
Tries to chat up a girl. â€œYou look nice.â€
â€œEw, gross. Fuck off.â€
He has to go home alone.
Up to his bedroom.
â€œNot today.â€
[laughs]
He just peels off this dry condom.
Staples it to that day on the calendar.
[laughs]
[applause]
Just think about the story you applauded.
[laughs]
Iâ€™d love a cork in my balls.
[audience laughs]
Iâ€™d love a cork in my balls.
It doesnâ€™t make sense for ladies to do it still.
In the 21st century, it makes no sense. It used to. Back in the day.
Back when we were nomads roaming the plains.
You remember those times.
It made sense. Back then, duties of the sexes were clearly delineated.
Back then, the lady, she took on full reproductive responsibility
â€™cause the guy, heâ€™d taken on full survival responsibility. Right?
He goes out there, you know, fighting off rival tribes and gathering meat.
But now anyone can buy a fuckinâ€™ Subway, you know. Who cares?
Doesnâ€™t matter who does what anymore. But back in the day, it did matter.
Back then if a lady got pregnant, that was a full-time job.
â€˜Cause it takes it out of you, being preggers on the savanna.
Itâ€™s brutal, the human pregnancy. Uniquely brutal in the animal kingdom.
For a species our size, it takes a long time.
It leaves a woman physically incapacitated.
Weâ€™re an upright animal, which is weird already,
and now, she canâ€™t bend over to pick up any rocks
to throw at a saber-tooth.
[laughs]
So she has to keep her fella sweet so heâ€™ll hang around and protect her.
â€œHey, baby, this mammoth giving you trouble?â€
[laughs]
Fight off the triceratops. My historyâ€™s not great.
Sheâ€™s walking around, pregnant. For nine months!
A sitting duck for nine months! Then she gives birth to that thing.
Itâ€™s not over yet, lady! Now sheâ€™s gotta pick it up and hold it!
For, like, two years.
Thatâ€™s her arms gone now.
She canâ€™t even uppercut the pterodactyls anymore.
[laughs]
Sheâ€™s gotta hold this fuckinâ€™ useless baby all the time!
â€˜Cause theyâ€™re useless, human babies. Fucking uselessâ€¦
Fucking useless, human babies. Sorry.
[laughs]
Absolutely useless, human babies.
A moment away from death at all times. Canâ€™t survive on their own at all.
The second theyâ€™re born, with their big, bowling ball heads
balanced precariously on their toothpick necks.
Every time you pick one up, theyâ€™re like, â€œTry not to kill me!â€
[laughs]
Thatâ€™s why we came up with morality in the first place.
You know, humans, we had to invent this thing called kindness
so we didnâ€™t boot our babies into the bush and move on!
â€˜Cause theyâ€™re liabilities!
Other animals donâ€™t need morality.
Other animalsâ€™ babies are instant survival experts. You know?
Like a baby elephant. You seen one? That thing just falls out of its mum.
[splats]
[laughs]
Then it just gets up and just starts walking.
Like itâ€™s catching up with a pub crawl, â€œOh, shit, sorry, everyone. Itâ€™s fine.
No, itâ€™s fine. Sorry.
[applause]
I thought I left my phone, but I got it.â€
[laughs]
Iâ€™d love a cork in my balls.
[laughs]
Iâ€™d love a cork in my balls. Because, ladies, I am an ally.
[women whooping]
Just kidding. That was a test, you failed.
[laughs]
Never trust a man who says that.
Yes. That was a test and you passed.
[laughs]
Never trust a man that says that. Heâ€™s probably lying!
Just because a person claims to be something,
does not mean they are that particular something.
And you can take that from me.
Miss Nigeria 2015.
[laughs]
Hard to be an ally now. Everyoneâ€™s got to be a very good person.
Itâ€™s hard. Iâ€™ve realized Iâ€™m not a good person.
Iâ€™m not a good person. Iâ€™m not a bad person,
but Iâ€™m not selfless enough to be a good person. You know?
Over the course of this pandemic, weâ€™ve seen what it takes to be good.
You gotta give shit up to look after others. I wonâ€™t do that.
Iâ€™m not a good person. Iâ€™m not a bad person, before you worry.
Iâ€™m not a bad person. Iâ€™m in between.
Like, for example, I once accidentally sat on a cat.
All right?
It was an accident!
But I didnâ€™t get up straight away. You know, thatâ€™sâ€¦
[laughs]
Thatâ€™s where I am on the spectrum.
I knew it was wrong, but I took my time.
But Iâ€™m decent, you know. Iâ€™m a decent guy.
I wouldnâ€™t go out of my way to hurt anyone,
but I wouldnâ€™t go out of my way to help them either.
I just wouldnâ€™t go out of my way.
Thatâ€™s my moral code. If youâ€™re falling over, Iâ€™ll catch you,
but you need to be falling onto me, pretty much.
[laughs]
Got a bad back. Canâ€™t be running around catching fools.
Itâ€™s okay to be decent. Especially if youâ€™re a guy.
Weâ€™ve made it pretty easy for ourselves.
Weâ€™ve spent centuries, us guys, lowering the moral bar for ourselves
so all thatâ€™s required for us to be one of the good ones is to not be bad.
Itâ€™s harder for women. Women are held to a higher ethical standard.
I think the word â€œdecentâ€ illustrates this clearly.
If youâ€™re a decent guy, thatâ€™s a compliment.
Notice that? â€œYou gotta meet my friend Paul. Heâ€™s a decent guy.â€
â€œShit! Letâ€™s get a drink with Paul now!
[laughs]
Every second without Paul is a living nightmare!
Where are you, Paul?!â€
There just seems to be more weight to the word â€œdecentâ€ if itâ€™s a man.
Like, if you went to a manâ€™s funeral,
you know, and the priest said,
â€œAlan was a decent man.â€
Youâ€™d be like, â€œ[gasps] Oh, no!
Alan sounded like a great guy!
Aw, I shouldâ€™ve hung out more with Alan!
Now Iâ€™ve missed out on all that sweet Alan time.
Rest in peace, you hero. See you up there.â€
[laughs]
If you went to a womanâ€™s funeral, and the priest said,
â€œSusie was a decent woman.â€
[laughs]
Youâ€™d be like: â€œUgh.
[laughs]
Susie wasnâ€™t trying, was she?
[laughs]
Sounds like your heart wasnâ€™t in it, Suze!
What did you die of? A lack of effort? Christ!
Put her in the ground. Letâ€™s have some sandwiches.â€
Itâ€™s difficult to be a good person all the time.
Itâ€™s difficult to feel like a good person. All the time at the moment.
I donâ€™t feel like a good person at the moment.
Especially in the wake of this COVID pandemic, I feelâ€¦
It sounds silly.
â€¦a little responsible for it all.
Because if weâ€™re out to believe the leading theory,
this pandemic, this virus, started in a meat market in China.
So if youâ€™re being lazy and a bit racist about the whole thing,
you could blame the pandemic on two groups of people,
Chinese people and meat eaters.
Now, I donâ€™t know about you, but I am both of those things.
[laughs]
Iâ€™m a Chinese meat eater.
All right. One of those things I canâ€™t change.
Obviously. No matter how hard I try, I canâ€™t do anything about.
And the other would require some sort of
facial reconstruction to look less Chinese.
[laughing and applauding]
It sounds expensive and painful.
Yeah. Gotta hand it to the vegans, though.
They were right the whole time, the vegans.
You shouldnâ€™t cram animals unnaturally close to one another.
Itâ€™ll all end in tears.
And theyâ€™ve been proved right in the most dramatic way imaginable.
And to their credit,
they have seen this opportunity for a huge worldwide I-told-you-so,
and they let it pass.
[laughs]
With uncharacteristic grace.
But I think thatâ€™s â€™cause deep down, theyâ€™re smug about the whole thing.
Theyâ€™re being quietly smug because they know this is their world now.
This is the world of the vegan now. The COVID era is the age of the vegan.
Because who better equipped to thrive in the coronavirus age
than someone for whom a loss of taste would be a blessed relief.
[laughs]
[whooping and applauding]
â€œPass me the mushroom burger, baby! Iâ€™ve tested positive!
Weâ€™re having seconds tonight.â€
Iâ€™m not a vegan myself. Iâ€™ve given it a good go.
I gave veganism a good go
over the course of a meal.
[laughs]
Iâ€™ve decided, that instead, to offset my carbon footprint,
I will just die 20 years early.
Thereâ€™s an old Buddhist proverb that goes, â€œA short life well-lived
is better than a long one with quinoa.â€
[laughs]
And I think thereâ€™s a lot of wisdom in those old texts.
Iâ€™ve been trying to eat healthier.
Iâ€™ve been trying to get slimmer, fitter, healthier.
Working out and all that.
Iâ€™ve let go of the, uh, comforting, but rather spurious idea
that a personâ€™s physical appearance is of no importance at all.
Itâ€™s not everything,
but itâ€™s not nothing either.
Thereâ€™s a happy medium somewhere in between.
But I used to comfort myself with all these old platitudes, you know.
Doesnâ€™t matter how I look on the outside, itâ€™s who I am on the inside that counts.
It turned out who I was on the inside was having trouble breathing.
Soâ€¦
[laughs]
Even the most well-meaning ideologies have their practical limits.
So I started working out, put some work in,
started working out, exercising. I lost some weight.
Lost a good bit of weight. I lost some weight.
[silence]
Thank you!
[laughs]
Appreciate it. Really kind. Made it all worth it. Thanks.
Lost some weight recently, lost a good bit.
Mainly from my, uh, dick, which is a shame.
[groans]
[laughs]
Never know where itâ€™s gonna come off, do you?
You always hope itâ€™s your belly or jawline. For me, itâ€™s my penis.
This is my body now.
This is my physique.
Iâ€™m content. Iâ€™m content with this body.
Iâ€™m not happy.
Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve not lost my mind. Iâ€™m not happy with my body.
But Iâ€™m content, you know.
Weâ€™re under too much pressure to be happy with our bodies.
Itâ€™s not really the job of your body to make you happy.
Because what is your body? Your body is just a compromise youâ€™ve made
between the lifestyles you want to live at the same time.
[laughs]
You know?
What is your body? Your body is the intersection
between your idealâ€¦
and your effort. Right?
This is my body. This is not the body I want.
I want a better body.
But this is how much I want that body.
[laughs]
[applauding]
Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™ve had no say in the matter.
Just trying to look good. Started working out. Gone to the gym.
[woman whoops]
Started working out. Thank you!
I started doing, uh, Pilates.
[women whooping]
Yeah, thatâ€™s right.
Old Philates Wang over here.
[laughs]
I love the Philates.
Gotta get on the olâ€™ Pilates, everyone. Pilates for the back, you see.
If you donâ€™t know what Pilates is, uh, Pilates is basically atheist yoga.
[laughs]
Thatâ€™s all it seems to be. Pilates.
Iâ€™ve been doing it a while now. Itâ€™s just atheist yoga.
Itâ€™s yoga without all the fuckinâ€™, you know, ghosts!
Thereâ€™s none of that.
[laughs]
None of that in Pilates.
[applauding]
Pilates is more like,
â€œBend over the stick. There is no God!â€ Thatâ€™s Pilates.
[laughs]
I think itâ€™s German.
Started, uh, doing Pilates. Trying to look better.
Trying to look better in my thirties. 31.
Trying to catch the pieces as they fall off, put them back in place.
[laughs]
Iâ€™ve started getting better haircuts. This is better, believe it or not!
I used to be a real cheapskate with the haircuts.
I used to go down to the nearest Lebanese guy, give him 10 pounds
and heâ€™d throw a pair of scissors at my head.
[laughs]
Iâ€™d hope for the best.
I live in the Lebanese part of London. I donâ€™t hunt down Lebanese people.
Now I go a bit further afield to an East Asian barber.
Now, East Asian hair is quite a unique beast.
It needs the appropriate lived experience. You know?
So I go to an East Asian barber now. I go to a Japanese place.
Because I forgive them.
[laughs]
You know, Nanking was a while ago. PlayStationâ€™s pretty good. Fair enough.
[laughs]
I like my barber. Cool guy.
My barber Tucker. Cool guy, Tucker.
Cool Japanese barber.
I like Tucker. We have good conversations while Iâ€™m in the chair.
Heâ€™s, uh, got very good English, Tucker. Heâ€™s been in the UK a few years now.
But he still has a strong Japanese accent. And understandably, from time to time,
he will not know the English word that heâ€™s reaching for.
But for some reason, he does know the English word,
â€œwhatchamacallit.â€
[laughs]
I donâ€™t know how, where he learned this word.
But Iâ€™m so glad he did.
Because it imbues all our conversations with magic.
So Iâ€™ll be sat in his chair. Heâ€™ll be cutting my hair.
Heâ€™ll just be telling me about his weekend.
Heâ€™ll just go like,
[in Japanese accent] â€œI was, uh, watching TV
in my apartment
sitting on my sofaâ€¦
and I saw an advert for theâ€¦
[groans]
Whatchamacallitâ€¦
[laughs]
Whatchamacallitâ€¦â€
[laughs]
[in normal voice] Thereâ€™s no point to this story. I just think itâ€™s funny
when he says, â€œwhatchamacallit.â€
Itâ€™s a good word to know if you donâ€™t know other words.
It catches a lot of them. Classic Japanese efficiency there.
[laughs]
I feel like some of you got uncomfortable when I did a Japanese accent.
Which is, of course, insane.
But I understand. These are racially fractious times, arenâ€™t they?
Hard to know what is right and wrong.
What is acceptable and what is not. What you can laugh at and what you canâ€™t.
And far be it for me to expect you to take an unnecessary risk for my benefit.
[laughs]
So you are forgiven. However,
for future reference,
and to protect you from future cowardice, Iâ€¦
For future reference, Iâ€™ve come up with some rules.
Some rules of thumb to help you decide in the moment
whether or not it is morally acceptable to do another personâ€™s accent.
Would you like to hear the rules?
[all] Yeah!
Of course you would, you fuckinâ€™ bigots!
[laughs]
So the first rule is, the umbrella rule, the catchall rule is,
if itâ€™s a good accentâ€¦
[laughing]
play ball.
Thatâ€™s fair. If itâ€™s a good accent, if you put in the time,
research and practice
to really nail that sucker down,
I donâ€™t think anyone has any right to complain.
What can they even say?
â€œHey, come on, thatâ€™s bang on.â€ What can they say?
Fuck it.
[applauding]
If itâ€™s a good accent, have at it.
Now, that doesnâ€™t cover me in every situation.
So the second rule is,
if the accent in question belongs to a people
who at any time had an empireâ€¦
[laughs]
or were on the naughty side during the warâ€¦
theyâ€™re not allowed to complain either!
[laughs]
Now, this gets you more accents than you think.
You get the obvious ones,
like English, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, German, blah, blah, blah.
But you get fun ones too!
[laughs]
You get Japanese.
You get, uh, Italian.
[laughs]
You get Turkish. You get Russian.
You get Egyptian.
You get Chinese! Yeah!
Might not be expecting old Wang to give you this green light, butâ€¦
[laughs]
Iâ€™m hoist with my own petard, yeah.
China is on a perpetual imperial mission, taking over the world.
Youâ€™re allowed to do a Chinese accent. Weâ€™re strong enough. Uh, we can take it.
[laughs]
I donâ€™t give a shit when someone does a Chinese accent. Water off a Wangâ€™s back.
[laughs]
The eagle does not concern himself with the impressions of the worm.
[laughs]
Couldnâ€™t care less when people do Chinese accents.
Donâ€™t care. My friends seem to care. My white woke friends care very much
when someone does an offensive Chinese accent.
Theyâ€™ll tell me about people doing offensive Chinese accents.
Iâ€™ve never asked them to.
But apparently I have this network of terrified spiesâ€¦
[laughs]
â€¦who just rush off into the world, get offended on my account and rush back to report.
â€œ[whimpering] Did you see? That celebrity did a Chinese accent!
Piers Morgan did a Chinese accent.
Gigi Hadid on Instagram, she did the eyes. I wonâ€™t do them now, but she did the eyes.
Arenâ€™t you sad? Arenâ€™t you offended? Do you feel diminished? Youâ€™ll be okay.â€
[mumbles, then groans]
Weâ€™re going to kill all of you.
[laughing and applauding]
We donâ€™t want to remember who did it, who didnâ€™t do itâ€¦
Whatever. Enjoy! Whatever, who cares. Enjoy.
Weâ€™re busy, actually.
Donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve noticed, but weâ€™re busy.
Handle your own HR, weâ€™re busy!
[laughs]
Weâ€™re flying to the moon. Raking over your footprints. Weâ€™re busy.
Taking thousands of photos of your city centers for reconnaissance.
[laughs]
Weâ€™re busy.
â€œOh, just a tourist, just a tourist.â€
[laughing and applauding]
[in Mandarin] Ready, fire!
[laughs]
[in English] Weâ€™re going to eat you all.
And you wonâ€™t even be the weirdest shit we ate that day.
[laughs]
Guys, thank you so much for coming out. Have a good night!

June 6, 2020
8:46 is a performance special by comedian Dave Chappelle about violence against African Americans. The special was released via YouTube on June 12, 2020. The performance is not a traditional stand-up comedy special, as it was recorded at a private outdoor venue due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ohio and features long stretches without humor.
The event was entitledÂ 8:46Â in reference to theÂ eight minutes and 46 secondsÂ that police officerÂ Derek ChauvinÂ knelt on the neck ofÂ George Floyd, a black man,Â murdering him, and Chappelleâ€™s time of birth on his birth certificate, being born at 8:46 AM.
Chappelle touches on Floydâ€™s death and subsequentÂ protests, discusses the history of violence against African-Americans in the United States and their attempts to push back, and takes aim at conservative punditsÂ Laura IngrahamÂ andÂ Candace OwensÂ for their policing of the black community
[car pulls up]
[indistinct conversation]
[music playing]
[applause]
Thank you! Thank you very much!
I hope you all can hear me.
[applause]
Will you guys shut the fuck up!
Just kidding! Thatâ€™s my family in the back, thatâ€™s why I did that.
Anyway, this is weird. And less than ideal circumstances to do a show. But the only way to figure out if this shit will actually work, well is to do the goddamn show.
So, thank you all for coming.
[applause]
I want to shout out all the young people who have had the courage to go out and do all this amazing work, protesting. [applause]
I am very proud of you.
[applause]
You kids are excellent drivers. I am comfortable in the back seat of the car.
So carry on, young ones.
Itâ€™s hard to figure out what to say about George Floyd. So Iâ€™m not going to say it yet.
[laughs]
I will say something.
[sigh] Are you guys having a good time, or is this weird?
[applause]
I gotta tell you, this is actually, like, the first concert in North America since all this shit happened, so, like it or not, itâ€™s history. Itâ€™s going to be in the books.
[applause]
At least we tried.
Thereâ€™s other comedians that wouldâ€“ Well this is not the first show but the other shows were like in drive-ins and if people liked the n*ggaâ€™s jokes theyâ€™d honk the horn.
[laughter]
And that didnâ€™t sound like any fun at all, did it?
[laughter]
So whatâ€™s you guys? You a black and white friend hanging out, do you guys know each other?
[inadubile]
Whew! Itâ€™s going to be a quiet ride home, isnâ€™t it? No, just kidding!
[laughter]
Iâ€™m just kidding, enjoy your riots.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m just kidding.
Theyâ€™re not really even riots. You notice that?
[sighs] This is a fucking weird time.
Mhmm.
In like 1993, Iâ€™m not sure what year it was, but I was in LA. I had smoked a joint and I was watching a movie, Apocalypse Now. It was like just after 4:00 in the morning. And what later would become the known Northridge earthquake happened. It felt like it started in my apartment.
You know? Iâ€™m from east of the Mississippi. On this side we donâ€™t know what earthquakes are about. I got to tell you something, man [burps]
Excuse me, burping.
This shit was terrifying. It was absolutely terrifying.
Uh, a lot of things went through my mind, I was like, not naked, but you know what I mean, just chilling in my boxers. Uh, I put my clothes on, I found my weed. And some, a pipe, and a lighter and some money, and my keys, all these things, while the earthquake is happening, while Iâ€™m experiencing what an earthquake is for the first time, and I was certain that I might very possibly die. As a matter of fact, I remember I made a point not to scream, just in case I lived, I wouldnâ€™t have to remember myself being vocally terrified. But I forgave myself for being terrified. That earthquake couldnâ€™t have been more than 35 seconds. This man kneeled on a manâ€™s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds! Can you imagine that!? This kid thought he was going to die. He knew he was going to die. He called for his mother. He called for his dead mother. Iâ€™ve only seen that once before in my life, my father, on his deathbed, called for his grandmother. When I watched that tape I understood this man knew he was going to die. People watched it, people filmed it, and for some reason, that I still donâ€™t understand, all these fucking police had their hands in their pockets.
Who. Are. You. Talking. To!
What are you signifying? That you can kneel on a manâ€™s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds and feel like you wouldnâ€™t get the wrath of God. Thatâ€™s what is happening right now.
Itâ€™s not for a single cop, itâ€™s for all of it. Fucking all of it. I donâ€™t mean to get heavy, but.
We gotta say something.
[applause]
He told the police he couldnâ€™t breathe.
One of the hardest parts of the tape to listen to.
He said, â€œPlease!â€
I canâ€™t tell you, as a man, watching another man go through something like that, what it makes you feel like. I didnâ€™t watch the tape for a week. I didnâ€™t watch it. I knew. I saw a still picture, I said, I donâ€™t want to see this, because I canâ€™t unsee it. But when I finally watched it, I understood, nobodyâ€™s going home. Anyone who sees this, well theyâ€™re going to be furious.
So the other night, Iâ€™m in my little clubhouse. And Iâ€™m watching Don Lemon, that hotbed of reality.
He says, â€œWhere are all these celebrities? Why arenâ€™t you talking?â€
This n*gga said everybody. I was screaming at the TV: I DARE YOU SAY ME, N*GGA!
[laughter]
I dare you!
Has anyone ever listened to me do comedy?
Have I not ever said anything about these things before?
So, now, all the sudden, this n*gga expects me to step in front of the streets and talk over the work these people are doing? As a celebrity? Answer me, do you want to see a celebrity right now? Do we give a fuck what Ja Rule thinks? Does it matter about celebrity? No! This is the streets talking for themselves. They donâ€™t need me right now!
[applause]
I kept my mouth shut.
And Iâ€™ll still keep my mouth shut.
But donâ€™t think that my silence is complicit of all the shit these n*ggas are saying. Trying to get everyone to sing these fucking songs. I know all these songs.
I was raised on these songs.
Why would anyone care what their favorite comedian thinks after they saw a police officer kneel on a manâ€™s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds? I canâ€™t get that number out of my head because it was my time of birth on my birth certificate. I was born at 8:46 in the morning. And they killed this n*gga. And eight minutes and forty-six seconds.
I watched everything everybody says. I see Candace Owens trying to convince white America, donâ€™t worry about it, heâ€™s a criminal anyway!
I donâ€™t give a fuck what this n*gga did. I donâ€™t care what this n*gga did. I donâ€™t care if he personally kicked Candace Owens in her stanky pussy. I donâ€™t know if it stinks but I imagine it does.
[laughter]
And if I ever find out Iâ€™ll let you know for sure. Iâ€™ll tell like Azealia Banks, Iâ€™ll tell.
[laughter]
Iâ€™m the worst.
But I know why. I figured out why they want to hear it from me, and itâ€™s serious.
The only reason people want to hear from people like me is because you trust me.
You donâ€™t expect me to think perfect. But I donâ€™t lie to you. Iâ€™m just a guy. And I donâ€™t lie to you. And every institution, every institution that we trust lies to us.
[applause]
How come they never talk about Chris Dorner?
Thatâ€™s a story about a man who believed he did everything right.
Do you know who Chris Dorner is?
Chris Dorner, if you remember, was an African American police officer in the LA PD.
He was executing a warrant with his partner. Who was a white woman.
And white women, I support you, but boy if you all donâ€™t shut the fuck up.
[laughter]
During the process of executing this warrant, this white woman did what Chris Dorner thought was excessive force. I donâ€™t know what she did. She kicked the mother fucker that was handcuffed, or hit a guy that was handcuffed, or something. Chris Dorner, the Black police officer that watched this white woman do this, reported this to his superior. Made a formal complaint. And was subsequently fired from the LA PD.
He went through the system.
He took every legal avenue he believed he had to get reinstated.
And he was not reinstated.
And when his last appeal was finished, this motherfuckerâ€¦ some wild shit.
Wrote a manifesto, you know where this is going.
And in that manifesto, he called me a genius.
Me. Dave Chappelle.
Not just me, but me.
Heâ€™s a Kevin Hart fan too.
[laughter]
But he called me a genius. And he told Bradley Cooper who is a friend of mine, donâ€™t do any more Hangovers, n*gga, thatâ€™s enough. Thatâ€™s what he said.
[laughter]
And he told his story. Chris Dorner told his story, how he did everything right when he was in the military, and subsequently, this was before any of this shit happened, and then he said, which was the wildest thing, he said Iâ€™m going to wage asymmetrical war on the LA police department and their families. Well, thatâ€™s an ominous thing to say.
And he did it.
This motherfucker, ambushed two police officers who just sitting in their squad car. Murdered them. He went to another police officerâ€™s house and killed his daughter.
Boy, it was terrifying.
And this motherfucker was on the run. He was doing it. I was supposed to do the GRAMMYs. I was supposed to present at the GRAMMYs that week, and a guy from the LA PD called me and said, â€œMr. Chappelle we understand youâ€™re coming to Los Angeles, and I donâ€™t know if you know, but there is a lunatic on the streets who is killing police officers and we would like to know if we can pick you up at the airport? We are extending this courtesy to everyone he mentioned in his manifesto. And I told the police, Iâ€™m fine. I read the manifesto, he likes me.
[laughter]
Is there anything I can do for you, n*gga? Because I get very worried!
[laughter]
They found him.
Big Bear. He was hiding in a cabin. When they figured out where this n*gga was, no less than 400 police officers showed up and answered the call. And boy let me tell you something, they swiss-cheesed this n*gga. He is dead as dead could be. He is done.
And you know why 400 cops showed up? Because one of their own was murdered.
So how the fuck canâ€™t they understand whatâ€™s going on in these streets?
[applause]
We saw ourselves like you see yourself.
They werenâ€™t the only one.
LeBron James once said something about racism and Laura Ingraham, which, I will say publicly anywhere, any time, is a cunt.
[laughter]
Tell â€™em I said it.
[applause]
Told one of Ohioâ€™s greatest residents ever: â€œShut up and dribble.â€
Iâ€™ll tell you something about LeBron.
This n*gga was on the cover of Sports Illustrated when he was 17 years old, and exceeded every expectation that they had for him. This business is treacherous. This is a good guy LeBron, heâ€™s a family man, and this, that and the other. He didnâ€™t let anyone down. He didnâ€™t let anyone down. Came back to Ohio, won us a championship, and then was like, Iâ€™m going to move to LA, and everyone in Ohio was like, n*gga we understand.
[laughter]
Heâ€™s a good man, LaBron James. The bitch told my friend to shut up and dribble. My friend is the best at something, and this bitch is not the best at anything. Just a regular-ass white bitch with a platform. And I use the word bitch all the time because this is â€œblack.â€
[sigh]
Watch one shooting after another: Eric Garner in New York, the first guy that told the police, â€œI canâ€™t breathe.â€ Eric Garner was selling loose cigarettes in Staten Island. When my kid was born, my first son, my wife lived in Staten Island, itâ€™s an awful place. She knows it, everyone whoâ€™s ever been there knows it. Yuck, to Staten Island.
And my black ass would go there, and I got a lot of fans there, and friends there, but this is a very terrible place. Fuck everybody in Staten Island except the Wu Tang Clan.
[laughter]
Got murdered by one police officer while five of his fellow officers watched him do it.
[no audio]
Not one of them said, â€œFrank, Frank take it easy.â€ None of that shit. Because they were being recorded. Because they were afraid if I correct my fellow officer on this camera itâ€™s going to open us up for some kind of liability. And the guy killed the person that they were, uh, what do you call it? Apprehending? The guy was selling loose cigarettes.
There goes Eric Garner.
[sigh] And then we have one after the other.
Trayvon Martin gets murdered by just a regular n*gga thatâ€¦ George Zimmerman is nobody.
George Zimmerman is an awful human being. He threatened Beyonceâ€™s life, he threatened Jay-Zâ€™s life, he signed Skittle bags because Trayvon Martin had Skittles on him when he was murdered by George Zimmerman. Boy, how do we feel?
How do we feel right now? This kid was 15 years old being followed by a grown man with a gun and whooped his monkey ass. He beat the shit out of George Zimmerman and George Zimmerman murdered him, Iâ€™m very upset. This kid looked eerily like the president, he looked like my own children. I hate George Zimmerman. As an idea. Not as a guy, Iâ€™ve never met him. Iâ€™m sure I would though.
[laughter]
Hit the streets. You got them marching. Dylann Roof. Dylann Roof killed eight people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. He prayed with them first, and then he shot them at point-blank range.
It goes on and on. And in one weekend a law abiding citizen right here in Beaver Creek is murdered. The cop that murdered John Crawford pulled me over the night before and let me off with a warning. And the next day, kills a kid. He says, drop the weapon, bang bang bang.
This kid didnâ€™t even have enough time to register that he was the one being spoken to.
This is our home town. It happened right here. I was very proud to be your neighbor, I love the way you guys hit those streets. We said his name and we tried to make sure everyone remembered him but he got lost in the sauce. And this guy John Crawford was a saint. He was there buying shit so him and his kids could make sâ€™mores.
Michael Brown got shot the same week, and Michael Brown became the story.
And then, am I boring you?
Well then, right back in Minneapolis was Philando Castile. Law abiding citizen, was a registered gun carrier, was trying to show police the paperwork for his registered weapon and was murdered in front of his wife and his child and then right in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, just two days later it happens again. And what do you think is going to happen? Three days later nine cops get murdered in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter rally.
Wow, Iâ€™ll never forget it. It was the first time I ever thought, I gotta get my family the fuck out of this place. These n*ggas will never understand. Iâ€™m tired of explaining to these people something thatâ€™s so goddamn obvious.
The guy that killed those nine cops, just like Chris Dorner before him, was from our military.
And then right after he did it, another four cops were shot dead in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Again, a Black man, that served in our military. What are they doing? Why would our guys do that?
Black people from the military? Because they believe, just like they did when they were joining the fucking military, that they were fighting acts of terror.
These are our people. These are our countrymen.
If I were white, and saw one of these men get murdered and I was in the NRA why wouldnâ€™t I stand up for them. A card carrying legal gun owner that gets murdered in cold blood?
Because heâ€™s Black.
Thatâ€™s why they donâ€™t give a fuck.
Thereâ€™s only one time the NRA ever supported an assault weapon ban.
You know when it was? It was when the Black Panthers stormed the state capital with assault rifles in California.
[applause]
Candace Owens, that rotten bitch.
Sheâ€™s the worst. I canâ€™t think of a worse way to make money.
The most articulate idiot Iâ€™ve ever seen in my fucking life. Sheâ€™s so articulate sheâ€™ll tell you how fucking stupid she is precisely.
And she told George Floydâ€™s wrap recordâ€¦
On the internet. â€œOh, he was the this, he did that, and he was, heâ€™s a drug addict. And he was not a hero. And why does the Black community make him a hero? Why do you chose him as a hero?â€ We didnâ€™t chose him, you did! They killed him, and that wasnâ€™t right, so heâ€™s the guy.
Weâ€™re not desperate for heroes in the Black community. Any n*gga that survives this nightmare is my goddamn hero.
[applause]
This is not funny at all.
[laughter]
I got some pussy jokes too, I could do, but I just really justâ€¦
[laughter]
Slavery is a really wild concept.
Uh, itâ€™s some weird shit.
The night that those nine police officers were killed felt like the end of the world.
The only reason it wasnâ€™t the end of the world, in my opinion, was because at the very same time that was happening, Kobe Bryant was playing his last game as an LA Laker. And as scary as all that shit was, I kept flipping back to see if Kobe would drop sixty, and he did. Oh, and he did.
And vaguely in the back of my mind I remember the idiot ass bitch telling somebody to shut up and dribble, and I watched this n*gga dribbling and saving this goddamn country from itself. I loved Kobe Bryant. He died the night, the day I won a GRAMMY, he died.
Thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t show up at the GRAMMYs. Because Kobe died. They had both of his fucking jersey numbers hanging up. 8, 24. Well, thatâ€™s my birthday.
I cried like a baby.
[sighs]
So, hereâ€™s what I said on Saturday Night Live that I got completely wrong:
At the end of my set I talked about how few Black people were invited to the White House.
How Frederick Douglass was the first. And that it didnâ€™t happen again until Roosevelt.
But that was wrong. It happened one other time before that. Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson received delegation of African Americans at the White House. They were from South Carolina. There was a man who was lynched for a $30 dispute at a grain elevator and they killed him because the n*gga was rich, and they hated him for being more welathy then they were, and they murdered him. And the people in South Carolina said, fuck that, and they went via the governor of South Carolina, it was a Black delegation that was facilitated to meet with Woodrow Wilson. That delegation was lead by the AME Bishop William David Chappelle.
Thatâ€™s where I get my name. It was my great- grandfather, who was a slave when he was born.
[applause]
These things are not old. This is not a long time ago, itâ€™s today. Itâ€™s today.
That manâ€™s wife was the woman that my father called on on his deathbed. And they were slaves.
Are you out of your fucking mind if you canâ€™t see that? And these n*ggas say why isnâ€™t David Chappelle saying anything? Because David Chappelle understands what the fuck he is seeing. And these streets will speak for themselves weather Iâ€™m alive or dead.
[applause]
I trust you guys.
I love you guys.
Weâ€™ll keep this space open.
This is the last stronghold for civil discourse. After this shit itâ€™s just rat-a-tat-tata-tat-ta-tat-tat-TAT!
[applause]
I love you very much, thank you for being here. Goodnight.

[whistling and cheering]
[mouths]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Look at you. Look at you. New Jersey.
[cheering]
Yeah! Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here. Itâ€™s the people. Itâ€™s definitely not the weather. Itâ€™s the people.
Thank you so much for coming out. Iâ€™m proud of you. Good job getting out of the house. Good job.
[applause]
[chuckles] Itâ€™s nice to be back. It really is. Iâ€™ve been living in LA now. Uh. Itâ€™s a little scary. The planet doesnâ€™t want us anymore. Weâ€™re on fireâ€¦ all the time. My kids just run out on the lawn and catch ashes on their tongues, like itâ€™s snowflakes. â€œThank you, Santa.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œSpit that out. Itâ€™s our neighborâ€™s house.â€
The planet doesnâ€™t want any of us though, right? Everyoneâ€™s in trouble now. Houston got it a couple times, Floridaâ€¦ Uh. The Bahamas, Puerto Ricoâ€¦ How about the poor people in Staten Island? Oh, man. Could you imagineâ€¦ having to live in Staten Island?
[applause]
There are people there right nowâ€¦ putting on their pajamasâ€¦ knowing theyâ€™re going to wake up in Staten Island. And what are we doing? Just laughing, having a good timeâ€¦ like itâ€™s not even going on. People in the Bahamas just had a fundraiser for the people in Staten Island. Thoughts and prayers, guys.
But thank you for coming out. You look beautiful. I hope youâ€™re doing alright. You look happy. I travel the whole country and everybodyâ€™s freaking out. Everywhere I go, people are doing deep yoga breaths in the airport. Theyâ€™re downloading meditation apps on their phone, just trying to keep it together. Calm down, youâ€™re doing great. Youâ€™re doing great. Iâ€™m telling you, youâ€™re doing great. Life isnâ€™t perfect. It never was, and it never will be. Weâ€™ve all got stuff to deal with. Youâ€™re doing great.
So what, youâ€™re fat. Who cares? Weâ€™re all fat. Youâ€™re either really fat, kind of fat, or trying not to be fat. Either way, fatâ€™s coming. And thatâ€™s alright. Donâ€™t hate on it. You know why youâ€™re fat? Because youâ€™re winners. Yeah, first generation, born at the right time, doesnâ€™t have to fight for survival. Food always within armâ€™s reach, perfect temperature everywhere you go. Every day you wake up in America, itâ€™s a perfect 72 and snacky. So, yeah, weâ€™re going to be a little chubby. Big deal. Donâ€™t hate on it. Donâ€™t hate on it. Accept you. This is it, guys.
Youâ€™re a grown-up. Youâ€™re an adult. This is what you ended up looking like. Game over. So, you donâ€™t have the body of an Olympic athlete. Wellâ€¦ youâ€™re not an Olympic athlete. Youâ€™re Don from Sales. You got a fat ass, you wear khakis, you hike them up when you walk. We still like ya. So, donâ€™t tell me what youâ€™re quitting. I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care what your low self-esteemâ€¦ decided you should quit this week. â€œIâ€™m quitting meat.â€ â€œIâ€™m quitting gluten.â€ I donâ€™t care. Youâ€™re my friend. You looked awful yesterday. Youâ€™re going to look a little worse tomorrow. Yeah.
[whooping and applause]
Why are we even talking about this? Letâ€™s get some ice cream and enjoy the day.
My wife quit sugar in January because she ate cookies like a monsterâ€¦ all through December, and on January 1st, came marching into the kitchen: â€œThatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m never eating sugar again.â€ [chuckling] â€œYes, you are.â€ And youâ€™re going to eat more than you ever ate before. Not because youâ€™re weak, but because youâ€™re a human being and you get sad sometimes. And to stop yourself from slitting your own throat, you eat a cookie once in a while.
I have friends in my life that donâ€™t eat bread anymore. They donâ€™t eat bread. [slower] They donâ€™t eat bread. Theyâ€™re going to lose three and a half pounds. No oneâ€™s ever going to know. And they donâ€™t eat bread. Why are you even here?
[applause]
Could you imagine? No toast in the morning with butter for the rest of your life? Kill yourself. Make some room for people who know how to live. I know itâ€™s hard. I know, I feel the pressure too. Everyone in your face, telling you to do more, lose more weight, be betterâ€¦ I get it. I get it. They show you the ads for the gym, they show you to try to get you to join up, like the â€œBeforeâ€ and â€œAfterâ€ guy. I always like the â€œBeforeâ€ guy, frankly. Yeah, he looks a little chubby. He also looks like he has a box of donuts and a lot of friends. That â€œAfterâ€ guyâ€™s got a weird look in his eye. Looks like he takes his shirt off when he shouldnâ€™t.
Theyâ€™re always getting in our face: â€œYeah, well, other generations were skinnier.â€ Yeah? Well, their lives were miserable. Gandhi didnâ€™t look like Gandhi because he was killing it at SoulCycle. He had a horrible life. He wore a diaper and ate butterflies for lunch.
Every show has a makeover segment on it now, right? They always take some woman, tell her sheâ€™s not good enough, and, therefore, no women watching are good enough. Itâ€™s always a momâ€¦ Always a mom. Just a worker. Right? Fifteen kids and 20 animalsâ€¦ driving around in her Cheerio-covered minivan. She didnâ€™t think her life was going to go this way, no. She thought she was going to be a princess. Thatâ€™s what they told her her whole life: â€œYouâ€™re a princess.â€ And on her wedding day, she thought she made it. They dressed her up like a snow queen. They took pictures of her next to the duck pond. She thought she did it. She woke up the next morning, they took her veil away, gave her some sweatpants and told her to get to work.
[applause]
But she doesnâ€™t care. She loves this family, dedicates her life to these people. Sheâ€™s an angel here on Earth. And what does her family do in return? They pop out of a pantry on national TV and scream in her face. â€˜Weâ€™re giving you a makeover!â€ â€œI thought I looked okay.â€ â€œNo, youâ€™re disgusting. We had a meeting when you were making us lunch. We decided weâ€™re not going to look at this anymore.â€
Then they drag her ass to The Today Show. They put her in clothes she could never afford or wear. She canâ€™t wear heels this big. Theyâ€™re going to get stuck in the field when sheâ€™s putting up the soccer nets. Hair and makeup she could never replicate on her own without an extra three hours in the morning before the school bus comes. This is the worst part: On national TV, she comes waddling out in her heels, trying not to fall. Her whole familyâ€™s in front of her, they start crying, in her face. â€œOh my God, youâ€™re beautiful. You look nothing like you.â€
Cut her a break. Youâ€™ve got to be nicer to each other. Youâ€™ve got to be nicer to yourself. This is hard. Itâ€™s hard what weâ€™re doing, isnâ€™t it? Itâ€™s hard being a person. Yeah. Itâ€™s hard. When I was little, I used to look at grown-ups with money and cars and think, â€œWow, that looks fun. I canâ€™t wait.â€ Then I was an adult for six weeks. Iâ€™m like, â€œThis blows. â€œI have to pay for everything.â€ Just the physical maintenance of you every day, right? Itâ€™s endless. Just the brushing and cleaning and wipingâ€¦ hopefully every day. Itâ€™s like youâ€™re your own pet. And some people donâ€™t take care of their pet very well. You see them on the sidewalk, their hairâ€™s all matted, looks like they ate out of the garbage. â€œWhereâ€™s your collar, Dan?â€ â€œAaah!â€
God. Just the check list of stuff youâ€™ve got to do to get out of the house. I mean, look around tonight. Right? Look around. No oneâ€™s killing it in here. You look alright, but no oneâ€™s like, â€œWow, look at that guy.â€ And still, to look like this took some doing, didnâ€™t it? Yeah. You made choices, put things backâ€¦
[chuckling] I was walking down Sixth Avenue in New York, this businessman walking the other way. So well thought out, everything immaculate: suit, tie, leather shoes match his briefcaseâ€¦ glassesâ€¦ not a hair out of place. Fly open, one ball out. I understood. He did everything on the list, didnâ€™t check that one box. Just on his way to a meeting. Probably on his way back from a meeting, actually. No, thatâ€™s the other thing. As an adult, nobody cares. Nobody helps you. Probably looked him in the eye in the meeting. â€œIâ€™m not telling him, I got my own problems. I think Iâ€™m wearing my wifeâ€™s underwear today. I donâ€™t know what the hellâ€™s going on.â€ His wife probably kissed him goodbye in the morning. â€œSo long, honey. What a jackass. Heâ€™ll figure it out. If Iâ€™ve got to see it, so should everybody else. Wouldnâ€™t hurt to get a little sun on that guy once in a while.â€
[sighs] No one cares. Weâ€™re totally alone. You are. Even the people closest to you only get so close, right? The people you sleep next to, only so close. Youâ€™ve got to give yourself little pep talks in your head. All day long, like a crazy person. â€˜Cause youâ€™re the only one looking out for you. â€œIâ€™ve got my wallet, got my cell phone. Okay, okay. [sighs] Where are my keys? Where are my keys? Okay, Iâ€™ve got my keys. Alright, itâ€™s going to be a great day. Itâ€™s going to be a great day.â€ The only difference between you and a crazy person is they say it out loud on the street. [loudly] â€œIâ€™ve got my wallet, got my cell phoneâ€¦ Going to be a great day!â€ Youâ€™re looking at him across the street, â€œThis guyâ€™s nuts. We donâ€™t yell like that. [chuckling] No, we donâ€™t. We should get some ice cream.â€ [chuckles] No one cares.
Even my iPhone turned on me, my only true friend in the world. Itâ€™s taking all the photos I take and putting them in categories of its own choosing. It considers my fat face and my normal face to be two different people. And thereâ€™s a lot more of the fat face guy. Apparently, he owns the phone.
You ever catch yourself on the phone, that undershot?
[audience groaning]
[gasps] You donâ€™t even think youâ€™re fat, and youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m a monster.â€ â€œHow are they not just hitting me with a dart when I come out of the front doorâ€¦ and taking me to the zoo to be identified?â€
Itâ€™s hard. I donâ€™t know why we donâ€™t feel like weâ€™re doing great. You work hard, do all the stuff youâ€™re supposed to be doing. Youâ€™re doing your best, and still, you feel like itâ€™s not enough. I think itâ€™s social media. I think since social media came out. Before social media, I thought I was kicking ass. I really did. Now, every time I open my phone, someoneâ€™s in my face. â€œAre you killing it today?â€ â€œAre you living 100% maxed out energy?â€ â€œAre you living your best life?â€ No, Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m not doing any of those thingsâ€¦ because thatâ€™s not normal. I donâ€™t care what The Rockâ€™s Instagram says, thatâ€™s not normal.
You know whatâ€™s normal? How you feel right now. Right now, in your funny little gassy bodies. A little achy, a little tired, light-headedâ€¦ taking deep breaths, so you donâ€™t pass out in front of your friends. Worried about your bills, worried about how youâ€™re getting home, worried about that thing you found on your ass. Thatâ€™s normal. And itâ€™s exhausting and thatâ€™s normal too. Being tired, which I know you are all the time. That is normal. You donâ€™t need a five-hour energy drink. You need to lay down once in a while.
[audience whooping and applauding]
So, we beat ourselves up about it all the time. Right? All my friendsâ€¦ â€œI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. Two oâ€™clock in the afternoon, every day. I get so tired. Whatâ€™s wrong with me?â€ Nothing. Nothing. You woke up in the darkâ€¦ went to a job you donâ€™t enjoyâ€¦ Already put in five hours. They gave you 20 minutes for lunch, and now you need a nap. And they wonâ€™t let you. So, youâ€™ve got to hide in the bathroom stall from your co-workers with your feet upâ€¦
[applause]
â€¦close your eyes for ten seconds so maybe youâ€™ll get through the goddamn day.
Youâ€™re doing fine. Social media plays with your head, though. It does. You know? It has me, too. I read all these articlesâ€¦ People are getting clinically depressed because theyâ€™re looking at other peopleâ€™s lives on social media, and they start to think that their life pales in comparison. Calm down. First of all, no one has a great life. No one. No one. They are posting their best moments, with a filter, to make you feel shitty.
[applause]
â€œLook at us at the Eiffel Tower. Suck it, guys.â€ Yeah, they donâ€™t show them for three hours stuck at Baggage Claim, or sitting in the hotel for five days because the husbandâ€™s got diarrhea from a French tart he shouldnâ€™t have eaten. Yeah, thatâ€™s happening too, trust me.
And if your friend is douchey enough to post 50 pictures of their Hawaiian vacation while they know youâ€™re at work, donâ€™t get depressed, get even! Start posting pictures of you at their house. â€œBob just peed in the pool. LOL.â€ â€œSorry about all the people. Might want to change the sheets when you get back.â€
[chuckling] What are we doing to ourselves with this social media? Really? What are we doing? These are people I chose to follow. My friends and family. and I never get off Instagram or Facebook and think: â€œWow, good for everyone!â€ No, I want them all to die. When Iâ€™m on Instagram, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m in a traffic jam with everyone I know. When youâ€™re in traffic, youâ€™re like, â€œLook at this jerk-off. Out of my wayâ€¦â€ Thatâ€™s how I am on Instagram. â€œOh, â€˜Weâ€™re partying again.â€™ Theyâ€™re alcoholics, thatâ€™s what they are.â€ â€œOh, theyâ€™re in love. No, theyâ€™re not. He cheated on her last year. I know it.â€
Weâ€™ve got to control it, because it does get to you. It does. You see people with money and fame and you think, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with my life? Where did I screw up? Why arenâ€™t I living like that?â€ No. No, thatâ€™s an illusion. A simple life is what wins. A simple life.
This is a life. This is a life. You run out of toothpaste. You need more toothpaste. You tell yourself that for a week and a half. Standing on it, squeezing it, pushing through the hole from the inside. Just trying to get one strand on your brush, so you donâ€™t feel like a monster out in the world. You finally stop at CVS on the way home. You slide that fresh tube out of that long boxâ€¦ You feel like you did something, donâ€™t you?
[applause]
Yeah, you feel like a winner. Yeah. You are.
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, right? That was the perfect couple we were all supposed to emulate. Two perfect people in this relationship. Look at their life. Your life, your simple life, so much better. You donâ€™t want that life. Marriage: over. Good, they deserved it. That was arrogance. Take two perfect people, put them in one relationship? Thatâ€™s not going to work. You want your marriage to last, you need a little funny-looking in it. No, you need to look across the table and think, â€œWhere are you gonna go?â€
[applause]
When youâ€™re young and stupid, you think you want a supermodel. No, you moron, you donâ€™t want some beautiful woman asking to be taken to Europe. You want a girl with a crooked eye asking if you have jumper cables. Thatâ€™s your girl. Thatâ€™s a keeper. Sheâ€™s not running out on you, sheâ€™s limping around in circles in the parking lot.
[whooping and cheering]
These are the good times. You hear people talk about â€œthe good old daysâ€ all the time. Lately, â€œIf we could just go back to the good old days.'â€ â€œThe good old days.â€ Are you kidding me? These are â€œthe good old days.â€ The good old days? Weâ€™re just figuring out how to do stuff now, and we donâ€™t even have it figured out yet. You want to go to the good old days? They didnâ€™t know how to do anything back there. Nothing.
You ever see the first bicycle ever made? I donâ€™t know how to make anything. But I know you donâ€™t take the smallest wheel you can findâ€¦ and put that in the back, and the biggest wheel on earthâ€¦ and put that up front. Itâ€™s a bad bike. You couldnâ€™t even get in the seat by yourself. Your friends had to fling you up there by the ends of your handlebar mustacheâ€¦ and hope you landed on the seat. And once you started pedaling, you couldnâ€™t stop. You pedaled till you died. And that was okay, because your life expectancy in the good old daysâ€¦ twenty-eight years old.
Please! A horrible time to live. Hospitals were a nightmare. All they did was cut your leg off. Didnâ€™t matter what you had. Broken arm, the fluâ€¦ You walked in, you hopped back out.
No medicine. No medicine. No Advil. Could you imagine? A life without Advil? [gasps] You ever go to the cabinet and realize youâ€™re out of Advil? [gasps] I just lay on the ground and hope to die. What are you going to take, that 12-year-old Benadryl from the back? They had no TUMS. No TUMS! You ate, got gassy and exploded. These are the good old days.
Look at all your outfits. Look at these beautiful fabrics youâ€™re wearing. And I know you had options. This isnâ€™t your only outfit. No, not in the good old days. One hard woolen outfit. Hard leather shoes made out of pig liversâ€¦ and burlap underpants. Burlap underpants! Ever see black and white pictures from back then? Theyâ€™re all angry, just staring at the camera. Like, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with those people? Why are they so unhappy?â€ Burlap underpants.
[applause]
Awful!
No plumbing. You went into an outhouse. Into a hole in the groundâ€¦ and used leaves and a stick as toilet paper. Couldnâ€™t shower off. It wasnâ€™t invented yet. If you wanted to get clean, once every two weeks, you dipped in a pickle barrel in the middle of the kitchen with your family. [exclaims in horror] Could you imagine? Could you imagine going last? [exclaims in horror] A pickle barrel filled with hair and vagina water.
[audience groaning]
And you were cleaner coming out than when you went in. Put on your burlap underpants, climbed on your bike and went to town.
[applause]
Iâ€™ve got to say, for this tapingâ€¦ you guys are kicking ass.
[whooping]
Good people. Good job. Good job. If you think youâ€™re going to be on camera, probably not. Some of you. You guys are very bright up front. And you look really high. [Tom chuckling] Are you? You are. Yeah, you are. Heâ€™s frozen right now. Heâ€™s like, â€œHoly shit! â€œThe TV is talking to me.â€ Itâ€™s alright. Itâ€™s alright. You look good. Youâ€™re doing well. Deep breaths, deep breathsâ€¦ [chuckling] But you are going to be on camera. And youâ€™re going to see what Iâ€™m talking about. [Tom chuckles]
Money, thatâ€™s the big one. Money. Thatâ€™s the big stress. You know? Thatâ€™s what gets people down more than anything else. Right? Youâ€™re obsessed. â€œWe need more money, gotta get more money. Never have enough. More moneyâ€¦ I need more money!â€ But thatâ€™s a matter of perspective too. Look, you donâ€™t realizeâ€¦ We didnâ€™t realize when we were young and poor, how rich we really were. Right? Because you had freedom, and youâ€™ll never have it again. Yeah! Look, we all want money. We all do, right? You want as much as you can get. You want to take care of your family and your friends, to be able to get out of trouble, donâ€™t want to be stressed week-to-week. You want to be able to buy something stupid once in a while without your spouse calling you a moron. Right? If youâ€™re a 40-year-old man and you want to buy an Xbox, you should buy an Xbox. You donâ€™t need your wife calling you a moron. Youâ€™ll find that out in two weeksâ€™ timeâ€¦ when you realize you donâ€™t have any time for an Xbox because youâ€™re a 40-year-old man.
I made a horrible business decision. I got married and had two children. Horrible idea. I love them, but they just grow and get bigger and need more money and more money. At this point, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m living with two unemployed coke addicts. Seriously, they come into my office every morning: â€œHey, you got more money for me?â€ â€œWhat happened to the change from yesterday?â€™ â€œI donâ€™t know. The economy, right?â€
And I spoil them. I spoil the hell out of them. Because theyâ€™re girls. Theyâ€™re two girls. So, forget it. They got me. Oh, they got me. I hope they donâ€™t watch this and realize. No, they got me. And, you know, my father had money, but he didnâ€™t spoil us, so Iâ€™m going the other way. You know? My father made money, but he was like, â€œIâ€™m not going to give it to children. Iâ€™m going to spend it on what I want to spend it on.â€ Could you imagine living in a time where the children werenâ€™t in charge? Sounds like a magical time to be alive. He took us to an amusement park once, he saw the lineâ€¦ He said, â€œJust look at it through the fence, you get the idea.â€
My daughters make me take them out for ice cream three times a week. And I do it, like an idiot. Oh, theyâ€™re so entitled. They walk into that shop with the little sample spoons, the worst invention in retail. Justâ€¦ Nom, nom, nom. â€œNo. Noâ€ â€œLet me see if you did better with that one.â€ Nom, nom, nom. â€œNo.â€ My father took us out for ice cream once. â€œEveryone gets one scoop of vanilla, no cones. Put out your hands.â€ [in English accent] â€œThank you, Father. This is the most wonderful of days.â€ [Tom chuckles]
[sighs] Manâ€¦ But now the responsibility when you have these peopleâ€¦ Sometimes late at night, when my wife is asleep and the kids are asleep and the animals are just dreaming peacefully, without a care in the worldâ€¦ and Iâ€™m standing naked, alone in the hallway, rapt with fear, because I know their lives depend on me. And I canâ€™t tell anyone about it, I canâ€™t complain. I just have to swallow the stress and slowly lose my hair. I canâ€™t wake my daughter up at two oâ€™clock in the morning and just sit on the end of her bed. â€œHey, honey are you awake? Hey! You ever feel like youâ€™re not going to make it? Do you ever feel like you just canâ€™t do it anymore? Forget about it, get some sleep. Iâ€™ll see you at breakfast.â€ Brutal.
[applause]
No. Iâ€™ve just got to work. Iâ€™ve just got to work, the non-stop working. Oh, God. Just to go back to those easy days when youâ€™re just single, driving around in your little shitty car. Oh! Do you remember your first car? Yeah, what was it?
[man] â€™86 Subaru.
â€™86 Subaru. [wistful] Ohhh. Whereâ€™d you get it? Off a friend. Alright, it was an â€™86 Subaru. What year are we talkinâ€™? 1995. [laughing] Subaru before they were cool. Yeah. There werenâ€™t a lot of hikers and lesbians driving them back then. No way. What color was it? Silver. Thatâ€™s pretty cool. Was this in New Jersey? Yeah? Cruising aroundâ€¦ all coolâ€¦ Weed in your pocket in your Subaru. Remember what you paid for it?
[man] Five hundred.
Five hundred dollars? That was a lot of money back then. Oh, but you loved it, didnâ€™t you? Oh, God. How about you, high guy, did youâ€¦? Do you remember your first car?
[replies indistinctly]
Ford F-150. Hot damn. That wasnâ€™t here in New Jersey. No. Where was it?
[man] West Virginia.
West Virginia! [chuckles] Good for you. Yeah, you had to have a truck there, or theyâ€™d kick you out of the state. Imagine if you rolled up in the Subaru. No way! â€œWe saw a gay guy in the center of town.â€ [chuckles]
My first car was a Toyota Corolla.
[cheering]
Baby Shit Orange. Thatâ€™s what it said in the brochure. And I loved it. It was awful. If you have a horrible car right nowâ€¦ be proud of it, because you have freedom and youâ€™ll never have it again. You can do anything you want with a shit car. Find a Darth Vader headâ€¦ If you like Star Wars, glue it right to the hood. Canâ€™t do that with a leased Mercedes. No, they wonâ€™t let you. You can with a Subaru. Put on a Vader mask, get in the Vader-mobile, go the wrong way down the highway. Everyoneâ€™s getting out of your way, because they know youâ€™re poor and have nothing to lose.
[sighs] But you need dreams. You need dreams. You have to have goals at the end of all this. Obtainable, real goalsâ€¦ Lower your expectations. Really. No big jets and helicopters and all the restâ€¦ When this is all over for me, my dream, my dreamâ€¦ Bagel shop at the beach. Yeah, not owning one, working in one. I donâ€™t need that kind of pressure. Not a good beach, either. Jersey Shore in the winter. Yeah. This dreamâ€™s coming true. All I have to do is not wet myself in the interview. Iâ€™m getting this job. I want to make bagels for you in March at the Jersey Shore. â€œDid you just wet yourself?â€ â€œNo, I did not.â€ â€œWelcome aboard.â€
They say you should visualize your dreams. I do, I see it. I fantasize about it all the time. Who else works there? Juan, heâ€™s 72. He makes the bagels. He rides his bike there. I throw in some Spanish, so he knows Iâ€™m cool. â€œYo es muy guapo.â€ â€œYouâ€™re an idiot, Tom, but I like you.â€ And Sean, you need that guy. Heâ€™s a pothead, you need that. And Dolores, she works the register. A little older now, a little sloppy in the cabooseâ€¦ Doesnâ€™t have a good dental plan, eats a lot of day-old bagels, but, you knowâ€¦ Beggars canâ€™t be choosers. Itâ€™s Jersey Shore in the winter. Once in a while, she drops something at the register, bends down to pick it up, Juan and I catch each otherâ€™s eye, we think, â€œYeah, I would.â€
[loud laughter]
Thatâ€™s my dream. But not now, not now, not nowâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got to get the kids out. Theyâ€™ve got to move out. Iâ€™ve got to do all that. Thatâ€™s another weird thing, I just realized I canâ€™t believe theyâ€™re leaving. I have a seventeen-year-old. Sheâ€™s leaving. It struck me. I was like, â€œWait a minute. Wait a minute. I didnâ€™t want any of this. I didnâ€™t want this house. I didnâ€™t want this dog. I didnâ€™t want to live in this town. I did this for you. And now youâ€™re just gonna leave?â€ But then I thought, â€œBut wait, when theyâ€™re both gone, whatâ€™s stopping me? Whatâ€™s stopping me from going back to the life that I had before? How much can a Corolla be on eBay?â€ Iâ€™m going to get a backpack, fill it with everything I liked when I was 19: some Van Halen CDs, a little weedâ€¦ Iâ€™m going to walk up the driveway and blow the house up behind me like Die Hard.
[whooping, applause]
[Tom chuckles] Yeah. To be honestâ€¦ I donâ€™t want them to leave. Itâ€™s going to be rough. I donâ€™t want to see them go. No. Itâ€™s funâ€¦ Itâ€™sâ€¦ Theyâ€™re not even that great, and I want them to be around.
We have a mean girl. We have a mean girl. Yeah, I didnâ€™t know they were real. Theyâ€™re real. Yeah, I feel guilty. I made it. I feed it. Iâ€™m keeping it alive. I give it money. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m funding the terrorists. But it is complicated, because I canâ€™t tell how mean she is. When we were little, if you were a bad kid, they came right up to your father at school: â€œHey, you got a shitty one here. And your father was grateful an adult was talking to him: â€œThank you. Iâ€™ll beat him immediately.â€ Now, theyâ€™ll get fired if they say that. Itâ€™s confusing. I canâ€™t tell how mean she is and I love her. So itâ€™s allâ€¦ Iâ€™m sure, at some point, Hitlerâ€™s parents must have turned to each other, like, â€œHeâ€™s a little weird, right?â€ â€œYeah, heâ€™s weird. Heâ€™s six. Who has a mustache like that at six?â€
She got in the car the other day, reached over my shoulder, changed the radio stationâ€¦ A whole Taylor Swift station came on. I went to change itâ€¦ All the stations are hers now. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhen did that happen?â€ She goes, â€œDonâ€™t worry about it. Just make it louder.â€ Could you imagine, as a child, getting in your fatherâ€™s car, demanding he put on your music and then, â€œLouder, a little lower, louderâ€¦ Right there, chief, right there.â€ When you eventually came out of your comaâ€¦ they would have told you a story of how arrogant you wereâ€¦ and why you lost five years of your lifeâ€¦ when you were hit in the head with a pipeâ€¦ that you deserve.
But I get it. You know, this is the age when music hits your life. You donâ€™t listen to your parents anymore. When I was her age, thatâ€™s when Prince showed up. You think I was listening to my father? My fat, bald, white fatherâ€¦ when Prince showed up? Right? Half naked, his little nipple hairs sticking outâ€¦ Full mustache, but wearing makeup. Kind of gay, but singing about sleeping with women. I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know what this guy is trying to tell me, but Iâ€™m going to follow him to the end of my days.â€
[whooping, applause]
From that point on, all your role models were perverts, right? Prince, David Bowieâ€¦ Freddie Mercury running around with his ball bag hanging outâ€¦ We didnâ€™t even know he was gay. We didnâ€™t even know he was gay. The name of his band was Queen. Big penises on the side of the stage, shooting fireworksâ€¦ â€œWow, heâ€™s an interesting entertainer.â€ [chuckles]
But you know what? Honestly, I like that sheâ€™s a mean girl. I like it. What are we saying? You know? Girls should be tough. If it means being called mean, so what? Itâ€™s scary out there. Yeah, sheâ€™s tough. Go ahead. Sheâ€™s got to go out there and meet menâ€¦ Gotta meet men! Ugh! Gotta bring men home, big hairy men. Ugh! Who knew? Who knew that men were so awful? Who knew? I think the women knew. I think the women knew.
[whooping, applause]
Yeah, I think you knew. We had no idea. I feel bad. We should have been looking out for you. We had noâ€¦ Regular guys did not know that these guys were out there. And we know a lot of secrets. We didnâ€™t know these guys were so bad. Think of the psychotic narcissism of these men, that your hello when you meet a woman for the first time is to reach into your pants, take out your worst partâ€¦ and present it to her, like itâ€™s an award sheâ€™d be happy to receive. Thatâ€™s a psychopath. Iâ€™ve been married 19 years. When I take my pants off, lights are out. Curtains drawnâ€¦ Iâ€™m under the covers. I donâ€™t even want to see it. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m sorry, honey. By law, you have to take a look.â€
But itâ€™s good. Itâ€™s a great thing thatâ€™s happened. Weâ€™re correcting it, weâ€™re getting rid of horrible people. Weâ€™re changing the workplace. Itâ€™s a positive thing. I was worried about my daughters. I was, I was like, â€œHow am I going to teach themâ€¦ how awful men are?â€ You know? â€œHow are they going to know how bad guys can be?â€ Iâ€™m the only man in their life, and Iâ€™m pretty great. Especially to them. I was a week and a half away from just smashing a glass at the dinner tableâ€¦ and then Harvey Weinstein rode in like a heroâ€¦
[applause]
â€¦with tales to tell. And every week since then, thereâ€™s been another monster. My daughters will be lesbians by Thanksgiving. Youâ€™ve got to be tough. Youâ€™ve got to be tough. Itâ€™s tough out there.
One of our cats just died. That was a sad thing.
[audience] Aww!
Yeah, just one more to go. [laughter] No. To be honest, this cat and I did not get along. Uh, I tried to like her, but she didnâ€™t like me. You know a cat doesnâ€™t like you when you come home at night, it gets on its hind legs like a human being and runs at you with its claws out.
Thatâ€™s alright. Itâ€™s not my job to love the animals. They want animals. Itâ€™s my job as the father to get them animals. I get them animals. I drive them home, they live with them and love them, and when theyâ€™re about to die, I drive them back out. Iâ€™m like the warden on death row. They hear me coming with the cat carrier, they all back into the room: â€œWhoâ€™s he coming for this time?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know. Grace has been walking kind of funny.â€ Thereâ€™s one old cat with a harmonica. â€œDonâ€™t pay him no mind. He comes for all of us one day.â€ [meowing harmonica riff]
So, I brought her in to the vet. She knows sheâ€™s not feeling well. And she knows itâ€™s her last trip there. She sees the vet, turns to see my wifeâ€¦ Iâ€™m sitting there. The look of disappointment in this catâ€™s face like, â€œReally? You?â€ â€œLook, I donâ€™t want to be here either. Letâ€™s just get through this.â€ The vetâ€™s like, â€œAlright, so this is what happens. We give them one shot, that mellows them out, then we give them the second shot. Does the trick.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œI know. Iâ€™ve been here before.â€ And he said, â€œOkay. Iâ€™ll leave you two alone now, so you can say your goodbyes.â€ Youâ€™re in a vetâ€™s office. You canâ€™t be like, â€œNo, Iâ€™m good.â€ â€œI can skip that part. Just give me that collar, Iâ€™ll get out of here. Oh, the goodbye. Right!â€ The catâ€™s like, â€œGet off of me.â€
I didnâ€™t think I was going to cry. I didnâ€™t think I was going to cry, butâ€¦ she was really working it. She was really working it. I felt like her last goal on Earth was to break me. You know? She just kept looking at me with those big eyes, justâ€¦ And I was hanging in there. Then she went into her final purr. That sad, broken, pathetic death purr.. It was soâ€¦ [low, emotional purrs] Oh, I just lost it. As soon as I broke, she just laughed. â€œHa-ha!â€
[applause]
[chuckling] Iâ€™m nose to nose with her. Iâ€™m all sad, Iâ€™m all wet-faced. And she had a death spasm, like one of thoseâ€¦ Her paws landed on my face and my reaction was just, â€œAhhh!â€ The vet walks in, â€œDude, dude!â€ Choking the cat. â€œIâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry.â€ â€œI said there were two shots.â€ â€œI know, I was just helping out, I guess.â€
And the kids, you know, they were sad but thenâ€¦ you promise them another pet. [chuckling] You know? Canâ€™t do that with Grandma. Canâ€™t do that with Grandma. [deep voice] â€œHey, how are you? My nameâ€™s Flo. Where does Daddy keep the whiskey?â€ [chuckles] They said, â€œYou promised we could get a dog. You said when the cats pass, we can get a dog.â€ I was like, â€œYeah, but I meant when both the cats pass.â€ And the mean one started whispering to the other oneâ€¦ They were like, â€œWe can make that happen.â€ Weâ€™ve got to get them a dog. This is going to get weird. And I said, â€œAlright, Iâ€™ll agree. But it has to be a boy.â€ I need male energy in this house.â€ Everything is a girl. Everythingâ€™s a girl. My wifeâ€™s a girl, I made two girls, the cats were girlsâ€¦ We have a lizard. Itâ€™s a girl. Iâ€™m like, â€œWe need a boy.â€
And they agreed. And we got a black Lab and her name is Bella. I like her, though. Sheâ€™s cool. Sheâ€™s cool. Sheâ€™s got a little Rottweiler in her. We found her in Bakersfield on the side of a road. Yeah, see, I like a mutt. I like a mutt. If you like pure bredâ€¦ Whatever you want to do. Iâ€™m not going to judge. I donâ€™t know, but, you know, I watch the Westminster Dog Show and, you know, itâ€™s a little too fancy. All these purebredâ€¦ [English accent] â€œNow, the German Shepherd, blah, blah, blah.â€ â€œSixteenth centuryâ€¦ blah, blah, blah.â€ How about a â€œreal dogâ€ dog show? You know? â€œHereâ€™s Ralph from Bayonne. Has trouble keeping his tongue in his mouth. Got some of his ownerâ€™s edibles out of his backpack. Hasnâ€™t been the same since. Thatâ€™s Ralph from Bayonne.â€ [chuckles]
But, you know, this is all a part of it. You want to prepare your kids for life, but itâ€™s hard, right? Weâ€™re not really prepared for life. Itâ€™s hard. Everybodyâ€™s complaining, feeling like theyâ€™re not doing alright. Youâ€™re doing great. Youâ€™re doing great. I promise you. I donâ€™t say that lightly, my friends. I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t know any of you and Iâ€™m telling you, youâ€™re doing great. Iâ€™ll go one better. Youâ€™re peaking right now. Iâ€™m not kidding. You have a little money in your pocket, you can come watch this silly-ass showâ€¦ Itâ€™s not going to get much better, guys. These are the good times. In the not too far distant future, people will ask you to go somewhere, and your one question is going to be: â€œAre there stairs?â€ And if there are, youâ€™re not going.
Do what you can and donâ€™t beat yourselves up. Youâ€™re trying. Youâ€™re doing the best you can. You try and be nice to people, you try and work out, you try and take care of yourself, but youâ€™re going to skip and youâ€™re going to mess up all the time, right? You are. Did you work out today, sir?
[laughter]
No?
[man] Yeah.
Oh, you did? Good for you. What did you do?
[man] Two-mile run.
You took a two mile run. Good for you. How about you, West Virginia? Did you work out? No, sir. Did you work out yesterday?
I went to work.
You went to work. Weâ€™re counting that. Good for you. Where do you work?
I work in the city.
You work in the city. What do you do there?
I work in a restaurant.
You work in a restaurant. Are you a waiter?
Waiter and back of house.
Waiter and back of house. So, youâ€™re running your ass off the whole day. All day, probably longer than this guy. Mr. â€œI ran for two miles in my Nike uniform.â€ Youâ€™re slinging food and running around like a crazy personâ€¦ while high! Let me ask you, how does a guy from West Virginia, in a Ford F-150, end up in New York, working in a restaurant?
Because of my fiancÃ©e.
Because of your fiancÃ©e.
[audience] Aww!
Wow! Beautiful! How did you meet her?
We met online.
You met online. And you were like, â€œI found a guy from West Virginiaâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦who looks like heâ€™s got great weed.â€ And whatâ€™s your plan? Because Iâ€™m not judging youâ€¦
[laughter]
â€¦but I feel like youâ€™ve got to get back to the woods. Do you like New York City? You want to stay here for all of your days? I donâ€™t think so. No. Exactly! Itâ€™s a hellhole. You want to go back to rolling hills and your Ford truck. Will you go with him?
Yes.
You will. So, youâ€™re here, youâ€™re going toâ€¦ Is this the plan?
Weâ€™re going to Europe.
Youâ€™re going to Europe? What are you going to do there?
[man] Sheâ€™s from Portugal.
Youâ€™re from Portugal? This is the greatest story Iâ€™ve ever heard.
[applause, laughter]
This is a love story. You know what my love story is? I met a girl from New Jersey. Done!
[whooping, applause]
Good for you. You do whatever the hell you gotta do. Iâ€™m not giving you advice at all. You, I can talk to. No, you both look great. Youâ€™re doing what you got to do. You both look good. You know what my workout is? Apple Watch. Buzzes once an hour, tells me itâ€™s time to stand. [buzzes] â€œTime to stand, Tom.â€ â€œOkay, Apple watch.â€ â€œSorry I didnâ€™t get up the last two days.â€
A Fitbit? Get a Fitbit. Everyone should have a Fitbit. Strap something to your wrist, count what you normally do as exercise? Get it! â€œI walked from my car to my cubicle. Eighty steps!â€ â€œGood job, Carol. Good job. Youâ€™re an athlete now. You could run the 5K. Just a couple more steps. You could do it.â€
Do what you gotta do. Just donâ€™t die. All of you. Donâ€™t die! That should be the only thing on your Post-it Note. â€œDonâ€™t die.â€ And act accordingly. Right? Eat the right things when you can, walk the dog the long way, touch your toes once in a whileâ€¦ You donâ€™t want to wake in the middle of the night sweating for no reasonâ€¦ trying to figure out which is the bad arm to be tingly. â€œDo we have baby aspirin? I think weâ€™re supposed to take baby aspirinâ€¦ or lick a baby? Does someone have a baby? I think Iâ€™m having a heart attack.â€ Youâ€™ve got to go for physicals once in a while, which isnâ€™t the best. I just went recently. My doctorâ€¦ So humiliating, isnâ€™t it? At least when you go to an eye doctor, youâ€™re like, â€œMy eyes are good or bad. Itâ€™s not me.â€ But the doctor, itâ€™s like, â€œYouâ€™ve been living like an animal.â€ â€œIâ€™m sorry. I had a rough year.â€ So humiliating.
As a man, the most humiliating partâ€¦ youâ€™ve got to take your pants off in front of this guy. And I know, ladies, I knowâ€¦ what you deal with at the doctorâ€™s office is much worse than us. Iâ€™m not comparing it. What you have to smoosh your boobs up againstâ€¦ I know. What you deal withâ€¦ Look, thereâ€™s no stirrups where we go. There probably was at one time and we enjoyed it too much. But for us, the worst partâ€¦ you pull your pants off, he cups your balls and makes you cough. Still. No one knows why. Just for fun. And then, I immediately turn around and assume the positionâ€¦ and get ready for the rear entry. And this doctor Iâ€™ve been going to for ten years goes, â€œNo, Iâ€™m not doing that anymore.â€ â€œWell, itâ€™s not like I wanted you to.â€ Itâ€™s like he was breaking up with me. I was like, â€œHey, I only did this for you.â€ â€œAll these timesâ€¦ I didnâ€™t enjoy it once.â€ [chuckles]
But you do what you can. I donâ€™t want you to die. I want you to keep going, keep doing great. And donâ€™t do what other people tell you is a good time. It never is, never is. Right? Breakfast in bed. Perfect example. Horrible idea. Itâ€™s a bad idea. Every poor mother on Motherâ€™s Day has got to get a tray filled with hard toast and runny eggsâ€¦ and we pin her down in her bed. â€œEnjoy your breakfast, like a hospital patient. Good luck not spilling the juice on your nightgown. Weâ€™ll be at IHOP. See you in an hour.â€
And no more cruises. Stop with the dumbass cruises. Itâ€™s a dumb idea of a good vacation. Anything you can do on those dumbass boats, you can do here on land. Waterslide, shitty magic showsâ€¦ Itâ€™s all here. You donâ€™t need to go to the middle of the ocean, where you do not belongâ€¦ with two thousand other people, floating around on a giant white toilet. Thatâ€™s all those boats are: horrible toilets ruining the seas. What does everybody talk about on those dumb boats? â€œOh! The food! Oh, my God. Seven meals a day. They take your three meals, they add four more to it.â€ Yeah, great, and what does everybody do? Waddle off to their room and take a dump in the sea. Stop it.
I was in Italy, in this tiny little townâ€¦ You couldnâ€™t fit one more person there. Scariest thing I ever saw. In the middle of dinner, this cruise ship pulled into port. It was like our city was being attackedâ€¦ by a bigger city. The gangplank came down. They came waddling out in their Tommy Bahama and their flip-flops, ate everything they could find, went back on the boat, took another dump in the sea. Stop it.
[whooping]
And while weâ€™re at it, no more zip lining. Stop with the goddamn zip lining in beautiful places. Isnâ€™t it enough to go to these beautiful destinations, and absorb the beauty thatâ€™s before you in the three days you have there? Do you really have to be tied into a dirty harness and a lice-ridden helmet, pushed by a non-regulated local off a platform? Why? So you can fly along a wire through the treetops of the jungle? Get a book, sit at the oceanâ€™s edge, and calm down. Look, you want to zip line through a scary place? I get it. You want to zip line through Staten Island? You should. You should be high above that place, moving quicklyâ€¦ trying not to get shot as fast.
And donâ€™t watch so much news. Donâ€™t watch so much news. You want to feel better about yourself? Turn the news off.
[applause]
Iâ€™m serious. Like I said, weâ€™re blessed: the first generation that doesnâ€™t have to fight for survival. But weâ€™re also the first human brains that have to deal with horrible news, 24 hours a day on multiple devices. No other human being has had to deal with this onslaught. And itâ€™s controlling us and itâ€™s splitting us apart, and itâ€™s turning us on each other. Youâ€™ve got to be smarter than it. Youâ€™ve got to manage it. In the old days, the only news you got was a town crier. A man in tights and a wigâ€¦ came into your village. â€œHear ye, hear ye! Donna has syphilis.
[loud laughter]
Enjoy your day.â€ And you did, because thatâ€™s all the news you really need. Thatâ€™s it. Donâ€™t buy it. Youâ€™ve got to think for yourself. You guys, Iâ€™m telling you, youâ€™ll live a much better life.
But really, the real thing, the real thingâ€¦ honestly and with all sincerity, you have to find someone to love. You need someone to love. Thatâ€™s the whole answer. Really. It doesnâ€™t even have to be a person. It could be an animal. Really! You just need two eyes looking at you across the living room. It could be a fish! It could be a fish. Just looking at you, one eye at a time. Makes you feel accounted for, makes you feel needed. Itâ€™s important. You know?
The hardest part is finding someone to trust. Thatâ€™s hard. Because everyone lies to you. Everyone lies to you all the time. Your friends, co-workers, relatives, your parentsâ€¦ Your parents looked you in your little baby face and lied to you. I know they lied to you, because I have children and I lie to them.
I remember realizing my mother was a liar. She put out clothes for me, a new outfit for Tommy. You should have seen this outfit. For school, six years old, horrible. Red long-sleeved turtleneck shirt. Red! Long sleeved, form-fitting on my chubby body, turtleneck shirt. Tucked into orange plaid pants.
[groaning]
Yeah, with a belt and a buckle. So it was tucked in and cinched up tight. So, my little chubs hung over the side. And the pants didnâ€™t go all the way down, so you saw my shoes, my hard, black, feminine dress shoesâ€¦ with heels and buckles on those, like a pilgrim, like a fat little pilgrim.
I came down into the kitchen, â€œAre you sure, Mom? This is how I should go to school?â€ â€œYes, youâ€™re a handsome boy.â€ I went to school and got a beatingâ€¦ a beatingâ€¦ from children who cared. â€œKick him again, someoneâ€™s lying to this fat bastard!â€ He thinks he looks good. He looks like he works the dog track at six years old.â€
The hardest part, if you do find someone to love, and youâ€™re trying to figure out if youâ€™re going to go the distance, you have to realize, the person youâ€™re dating isnâ€™t the one youâ€™re going to spend most of your years with. Thatâ€™s why people split up. You have to think far out, 30 years out. What is this person going to be then? When youâ€™re dating, thatâ€™s young and sexy. Thatâ€™s the sales model. Thatâ€™s what moves it off the showroom floor. Youâ€™ve got to think 30 years out. Picture your man now three times the size. Just a snowman of blubber around his existing body. And bald. Heâ€™s going to be bald, or worse, just three hairs. Like a doll thatâ€™s been caught in a fire.
No more cool clothes, comfortable clothes. Yeah. Elastic waistbands and terry cloth material. Yeah, and Crocs for adultsâ€¦ Yeah, that he wears with socks, because sometimes itâ€™s cold in the morning when youâ€™re getting the paper.
No more motorcycle in the garage, but heâ€™s in the garage. You know why? He paints birdhouses now. Yeah, thatâ€™s why heâ€™s not having sex with you. Heâ€™s painting birdhouses.
The same thing with your girl. Young, beautiful, long hairâ€¦ When sheâ€™s old, it gets cut short, it goes straight up in a poof. Like sheâ€™s surprised. All old ladies look surprised. â€œSurprise! Iâ€™m still here. I almost slipped, but I didnâ€™t.â€
All she remembers about fashion is she likes flowers. Thatâ€™s all she wears, a shower curtain dress filled with flowers. One on each toe, one on her surprise head. â€œWho wants to play cards?â€
No more lace bras and panties. Underpants! Industrial-strength cotton, get-the-job-done, keep-everything-in-places-where-it-used-to-be underpantsâ€¦ that she hand washes in the sink. When youâ€™re brushing your teeth and have to spit in the toilet, if youâ€™re not aggravated, you married the right lady. And this isnâ€™t a sad story, this is the story. If everything goes right, this is the happy ending you get. [laughs smugly]
[whooping, applause]
But if you do want a human being and you donâ€™t have one, thatâ€™s on you. Thatâ€™s your fault. Youâ€™re picky, youâ€™re too damn picky. Lower your expectations. There are seven billion people out there. You can find one. You can find one person who doesnâ€™t make you throw up when they take their top off. What? Everyoneâ€™s weird and gross out there? Yeah? So are you! We all are. Thatâ€™s what love is, my friends. Finding someone whose flaws you can put up with. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s chemistry.
You ever take the first morning flight? That 6:00 a.m. flightâ€¦ where you wake up at home at 4:00. You donâ€™t even know how you got to the airport. Youâ€™re just, all of a sudden, under fluorescent lights at Security. [groans in confusion] Youâ€™re not in control of your body, no one is. I love that moment. Because thereâ€™s a sea of people who you could have woken up with, if you had made the wrong choice.
I was in on one recently, behind this older gentleman, he burped, farted and sneezedâ€¦ at the same time. Just exploded out of every one of his openings, all at once. Pa-pow! Like a human tugboat. Pa-pow! It was horrible. People scattered. Changed lanes, changed flightsâ€¦ Went home and tried again tomorrow. His wife stood next to him, did not flinch. She probably does the same thing. The two of them, every morning firing off, making coffeeâ€¦ Pa-pow, pa-pow! The cat, the dogâ€¦ Pa-pow, pa-pow-pow-pow! Like the grand finale on the 4th of July.
But thatâ€™s love and thatâ€™s what I wish for all of you. I thank you so much for coming out.
[loud cheering]
You guys were tremendous. Thank you so much. Thank you, New Jersey, you guys are great. Iâ€™ll see you next time.

Please welcome to the stage Tom Papa.
[cheers and applause]
Thank you.
[cheers and applause continue]
Cleveland. Thank you so much. You guys look great. Cleveland, Ohio.
[crowd cheering]
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here: good people, the best people. So great. Good to see you. Thank you for coming out. Look at you.
[cheers and applause]
Look at you. You made a little plan for yourself. And you stuck with it. You didnâ€™t cancel. I know you wanted to cancel. I know it. I know it. I almost did too.
[laughter]
Texting each other, â€œWe still gonna go to the thing?â€ â€œYeah. Donâ€™t you want to go?â€ â€œNo, I do. Iâ€™m just seeing if thereâ€™s any weakness on your part.â€ I will tear this night down.
[laughs] [applause]
Be home with my pants off all night. Thatâ€™s all you want. You just want to be home with your pants off. Oh, itâ€™s the best feeling in the world. And you only get it if you cancel. Oh, thereâ€™s no better feeling in the world than canceling. Oh! Itâ€™s the best! Just going from â€œI have to do somethingâ€ to â€œIâ€™m not doing anything.â€ Oh, what a dream. Canceling dinner plans with another couple? Oh, heaven. â€œYou think we can cancel on â€™em?â€ â€œYes. â€œI donâ€™t have to listen to him talk or watch her chew. Yes.â€ Oh, canceling the gym? Oh, that oneâ€™s sweet. You donâ€™t even have to call anyone. Just do it in your head. â€œIâ€™m not going.â€ Done.
[applause]
Oh, itâ€™s the best. Snow days? Remember snow days? Oh! Itâ€™s the best. God canceling everything on everybody. More powerful than your parents. â€œI want to go to school, but I canâ€™t. God wonâ€™t let us.â€
[laughter]
Yeah, itâ€™s a hard thing, not to cancel, and you didnâ€™t cancel, and you made it, and it means a lot, and I thank you.
[cheers and applause]
Sincerely. What else you gonna do, really? What are you gonna do, stay home? Watch the news? Watch more news? You gonna watch more news? Thatâ€™s a treat. Now, are you scared? Are you guys scared? Everybodyâ€™s scared now. Are you scared? Yeah? â€˜Cause you watch too much news. Turn it off. Go to a show. Look, some things are scary. Iâ€™ll give it to you. Uh, no grown-ups left, thatâ€™s kind of scary. Thereâ€™s no one left to fight the bad guys. Thereâ€™s adult coloring books now. Adult coloring books. And theyâ€™re popular. I saw a manâ€“a manâ€“ a grown manâ€“ on the floor of an airport. A man laying on his stomach on the floor of an airport, just coloring, justâ€“ Why even wear pants? Why? Youâ€™re not a man. Youâ€™re a baby man. My friendâ€™s like, â€œNo, Tom, you donâ€™t understand. â€œThey are adult. I have one. Itâ€™s a â€˜Game of Thronesâ€™ coloring book.â€ My apologies. I thought it was something childish, like â€œThe Hobbit.â€ I didnâ€™t know it was â€œGame of Thrones.â€ That must be hard, with all the snow in that show. Having to use the white crayon? You never really know if itâ€™s working or not. No one can deal. How about these people with the fake service dogs? You see these creeps? Fake serviceâ€“ thereâ€™s real service dogs that help real people. Then a girl shows up with a Pekinese sticking out of a Hello Kitty handbag and acts like itâ€™s working. And how little do you have to think of yourself to scam a certificate and show it at the gate? â€œI have to have this puppy with me on this flight, or Iâ€™m gonna lose my marbles.â€ â€œOh, by all means. Welcome aboard.â€ What could possibly go wrong with your crazy assâ€¦ at 40,000 feet? I got on a flight the end of last year. There was a woman next to me. Iâ€™m not making any of this up. Middle seat. She turned to me, and she had a Chihuahua in a BabyBjorn. I swear toâ€“head, penis, legs, and dog arms. The look of humiliation in this animalâ€™s faceâ€¦ He was just like, â€œI apologize. â€œWe normally walk. â€œWeâ€™ve been walking up till now. â€œIâ€™m gonna have to get pants. â€œThis is upsettâ€“ I canâ€™t reach.â€
[laughs]
[sighs] Look, itâ€™s easy to scare human beings. We scare easy. Weâ€™re a timid creature, you know? Weâ€“my wife is one of those people that gets frightened in restaurants if you donâ€™t give her exact directions to the bathroom. You have these people in your life? â€œWhere is it? Where?â€ â€œItâ€™s back there, to the right.â€ â€œBut where? Has anyone gone? Has anyone gone?â€ â€œNo, just follow a wall. Youâ€™ll get there.â€ Seriously, has anyone not come back? Has anyone not come back? â€œI miss Grandpa.â€ â€œMe too.â€ â€œWe shouldnâ€™t have taken him to the Applebeeâ€™s and let him go by himself.â€
[laughs]
Look, you get scared, but keep your eye on the ball. You know, you have to have perspective. Are you afraid of ISIS? You think ISIS is coming to your house? Are they coming to your house? No. Keep your eye on the ball. Thereâ€™s so many other ways you could die.
[laughter]
You drove here tonight. You made it here. You still got to get back. These roads are crazy. You should be scared of moms in Honda Odysseys. Thatâ€™s who you should be scared of, not some guy dressed up like a ninja from Party City running around Yemen. Keep it in perspective. Look, life is stressful. Itâ€™s hard being a human being. Itâ€™s hard. Itâ€™s hard getting through life. I understand. I had a hard day today as well. My whole day today was spent trying not to eat nachos. That was my whole day. No, theyâ€™re bad for me, I shouldnâ€™t eat them, and I canâ€™t stop. And I ate them again. I ate them again. Gas station nachos today.
[crowd groans]
Oh, back off. Your fancy Cleveland farm-to-table nacho attitude.
[cheers and applause]
You think a drug addict cares where he gets his drugs? No. He just gets them, and he puts them in his body. Look, Iâ€™m not an animal. I didnâ€™t wake up and say, â€œIâ€™m eating nachos today.â€ I woke up. I said, â€œNo, todayâ€™s the day. No nachos. Weâ€™re not doing it.â€ But thatâ€™s a different guy making those decisions. Thatâ€™s Morning Tom who says those things. Oh, no, youâ€™d like Morning Tom. Heâ€™s a winner. Heâ€™s a winner. Oh, Morning Tom, he puts on workout clothes, returns emails, makes fruit smoothies. Fruit smoothies. Gets a blender, puts in protein powder. Neeeeeeeee! Stare down my weak family eating Fruit Loops. Neeeeeeee! â€œYou guys are losers. You know that, right? â€œAll three of you. Youâ€™re looking at a winner right here.â€ We all are in the morning. Thereâ€™s a different you coming out right now. In the morning, youâ€™re clear-eyed and focused. Thatâ€™s why you never hit on anyone in the morning. You got to wait till late at night, when theyâ€™re confused and tired. They got to lay down somewhere; might as well be with you.
[cheers and applause]
No one has ever gotten laid in the history of mankind at the breakfast buffet. â€œIâ€™ll be back for waffles.â€ But thatâ€™s okay. Thatâ€™s all right, you know? Problem is, morning time doesnâ€™t last very long. Passes out around 2:00. And the guy that wakes up in his place is a very different guy. He is not a winner. That guys is notâ€“heâ€™s an alcoholic, is what he is. Takes that same blender and fills it up with margarita mix and tequila.
[cheers and applause]
Yeah.
[laughs]
Now my kids are looking at me. â€œWhoâ€™s the loser now?â€ Drunk at 3:00. And heâ€™s a liar. Heâ€™ll say anything to get me to drink, anything. â€œCome on. Just have one. â€œHave one. You deserve it. You deserve it.â€ Thatâ€™s all I got to hear. â€œYeah, youâ€™re right. I do deserve it. â€œYeah, I worked hard this week. I fixed the toilet too. â€œYou donâ€™t hear that running anymore, no. â€œI did that. â€œI took the lid off the back. â€œI put my hand in that creepy water. â€œI touched the chain with the grass on it. â€œI did that. â€œAnd itâ€™s fixed. â€œItâ€™s gonna stay fixedâ€¦ â€œas long as you use the other bathroom. â€œJust use the other toilet. Iâ€™m not sure what the hell I did.â€
[laughs]
And then heâ€“please. Then he just comes at you. â€œCome on. Come on. â€œIf you have one, you gonna stop at one? â€œYou canâ€™t stop at one. You think Sinatra ever stopped at one?â€ â€œYeah, youâ€™re right. â€œIâ€™m just like Sinatra too, â€œwithout the songs and the money. All right.â€ And then three hours later, Iâ€™m just wandering around my house drunk, with a phone in my hand. â€œI wonder if Panda Express makes nachos.â€ But thatâ€™s okay. You have to have perspective in your life. You have to enjoy yourself. You canâ€™t work crazy all the time. What difference does it make? You got to enjoy yourself. You know, if you worked all the time, what would be different? Nothing. Nothing. At this point in your life, donâ€™t you realize how much youâ€™re going to affect the world? Donâ€™t you realizeâ€¦
[laughter]
What youâ€™re going to accomplish? Calm down.
[cheers and applause]
Really. And thatâ€™s all right. Donâ€™t compare yourself to the people who change the world. Theyâ€™re freaks, genetic freaks. Steve Jobs, Edisonâ€“ freaks. First of all, no sleep. No sleep. Three hours of sleep a night, those guys. Three. Iâ€™m out. Iâ€™m out. I need a lot of sleep. Sometimes I wake up in the morning, my first thought is, â€œI donâ€™t think I can get a nap today.â€ I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t even know if I slept last night. I havenâ€™t even opened my eyes. I know I peed five times. I donâ€™t know if I REMâ€™d out at the end. And itâ€™s not a lazy thing; itâ€™s a genetic condition. I come from a long line of nappers. The Papa family naps. My whole childhood was waking up adults to ask them stuff. They would just lay around the living room like a pile of sea lions.
[laughter]
â€œDad, Dad. â€œDad. Can I go to Keithâ€™s house?â€ [long moan] â€œGrandma, Grandma, can I go to Keithâ€™s house?â€ [long moan] â€œShe moved her whiskers. Thatâ€™s yes. Letâ€™s go.â€
[laughs]
And so what? So you donâ€™t work all the time. Whatâ€™s gonna happen? Howâ€™s your life gonna change? What, youâ€™re not gonna be part of the super-rich? Is that whatâ€™s gonna happen? [muttering] First of all, that shouldnâ€™t be a goal. It doesnâ€™t change your life at all. And second of all, the list of people with all the money shrinks every year. Itâ€™s down to ten people now. In two years, itâ€™s gonna be, like, Bob. Bob has all the money. Everybody, just sleep in. Take the whole summer off. Bobâ€™s got all the money. And it shouldnâ€™t be a goal. Itâ€™s just this abstract thing that you just keep chasing, you know? Iâ€™veâ€“personally, never a goal. I donâ€™t need a lot of money. I can live a poetâ€™s life. I really, sincerely could. Donâ€™t need money. Donâ€™t need stuff. Always giving it away. I could move every week. I really could. But, uh, I do not live alone. [chuckles] Iâ€™m married, and I have two children, and they are greedy, capitalist pigs.
[laughter and applause]
â€œMore, more, more.â€ â€œWhaaa.â€ â€œI want food with every meal.â€ â€œWhaaa.â€ So I work hard. All my money goes to them. Every damn penny goes to these people. I live in a horrible school district in L.A. now, and it was either pay for school or guns and ammo. And they have no skills or coordination, so Iâ€™m paying for school. Goes against everything I believe in, but Iâ€™m paying for school. My only rule for paying for school is, I wonâ€™t pay for any school that is predominantly Asian. Why? Why would I pay all of that money for my kids to be last in everything? We canâ€™t compete. These families are dominant. They kick ass. We canâ€™t compete. Theyâ€™re straight-A students. These kids play five instruments, five. Theyâ€™re walking to school. They have an oboe and a violin and a drum kit. The dadâ€™s pushing a baby grand piano across the parking lot. My kids play the toilet paper roll. Literally, we just walk around the house. [imitating horn playing music] â€œI think you got it, honey.â€ [imitating horn] â€œI donâ€™t think you have to practice anymore. â€œGet some Pop-Tarts. Sit on the couch. Enjoy your life.â€ They beat us everywhere we go. I put the little one on the swim team. I figure we have a chance there, right? Letâ€™s go to the pool. Thatâ€™s an Asian-free zone. Letâ€™s try it. Not anymore. They dominated every other sport. Now theyâ€™re at the pool. But my kidâ€™s big. Sheâ€™s got a back like Michael Phelps. Iâ€™m like, â€œWe can take â€™em. Come on. We can do this.â€ They hit the gun. Their kids took off like speed boats. My kid, two strokes, drowned right in their wake. We scooped her out, resuscitated her, put her right back on the couch. And we quit that night. We quit that night. She was like, â€œI thought weâ€™re not allowed to quit things, Dad.â€ â€œYeah, well, Iâ€™m not gonna be humiliated â€œlike that again. â€œIâ€™m not gonna ruin my Saturdays â€œand sit through that. â€œYeah, you lay there â€œand think about what you might be good at, and weâ€™ll try again.â€
[laughs]
Nowâ€“so Iâ€™m not gonna be part of the super-rich, and I have news for you. Uh, youâ€™re not either.
[laughter]
They donâ€™t do this. They donâ€™t come out to the ass end of Cleveland, sit in the dark, and listen to jokes.
[cheers and applause]
They do different things. They summer. They summer. They summer. Do you summer? I donâ€™t summer. Summer happens, and I deal with it. Just stay in the shade and walk slow. No, they buy all white, a whole white wardrobe on Memorial Day to go summer. I canâ€™t wear white. I bought a white shirt last year. I sweat through it in 20 minutes. It looked like I was smuggling turkey gravy under my armpits. Yeah, I should have thrown it out, but I spent 20 bucks for it at Old Navy. Iâ€™m gonna wear it. I just kept my arms in the reason of the season. No, we donâ€™t summer. We donâ€™t wear all white. My family doesnâ€™t have parties in the middle of a wheat field. We donâ€™t have a dining room table in the middle of a field where food just falls from the heavens and everyoneâ€™s beautiful and the dad stands up and quotes Shakespeare and everybody laughs, â€™cause they get it. That is not my family. We go to my sisterâ€™s picnic table. We eat egg salad sandwiches. We push Grandma in the kiddie pool, and her tit pops out. Thatâ€™s what we laugh at. Thatâ€™s what we get. â€œOh, Grandma, your titteth has poppethed out. To be or not to be in a home.â€ I say we keep her. Sheâ€™s hilarious. Puts sponges in the toaster. Who does that?
[laughs]
Look, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with making money, right? You want to make money. You have to make money. Iâ€™m not saying you want to be poor. Weâ€™ve all been there, right? When I started comedy out of college, I made five bucks a night, five, in New York. I needed the money. It was fun times, but everything smelled like hot dogs, everything. I did. My girlfriend did. It was like, â€œAre we making hot dogs again?â€ â€œNo, thatâ€™s us. We got to get jobs. This is not working out. We smell weird.â€ But how much is enough? You know what I mean? How much is enough? Do you really need a mansion? Who needs a mansion? Who needs a mansion? If you have 80 children, you should have a mansion, right? If you have 80 children, you need that square footage. You know what these places look like, â€™cause they come in the beautiful real estate section of the Sunday paper, this beautiful magazine filled with mansions. Why? Why are you putting that in the poor people newspaper? Whoâ€™s couponing and looking for a mansion in the same paper?
[cheers and applause]
They always have those perfect kitchens, the beautiful island with a fruit bowl with a pyramid of perfect green apples. You eat one. A new one just appears out of nowhere, â€™cause they have an apple boy. They have an apple boy. Just sits under the kitchen sink and waits. Iâ€™ve never even bought a fruit bowl. Have you ever bought a fruit bowl? No. You buy fruit. You need a bowl. You just pick it out of the other bowls. Congratulations, bowl. Youâ€™ve been nominated. Say good-bye to your friends. Youâ€™re the fruit bowl. And fruit isnâ€™t even the main thing in the fruit bowl. Itâ€™s mostly car keys and pennies and garlic skin. One black banana from 1995. No one wants to pick it up, â€™cause you know itâ€™s gonna split. So if you have a lot of money and you help people, thatâ€™s one thing, but the cultureâ€™s devolved into this â€œIâ€™m better than youâ€ attitude just to have stuff. You know people in your family and friends who just mortgage it, lease it just to say, â€œIâ€™m better than you,â€ even if they donâ€™t have it. â€œJust look at what I have. â€œLook at my car. Itâ€™s newer than yours. â€œLook at my wife. Sheâ€™s newer than yours. â€œShe might be older, but she has all new parts. â€œWhere do you shop? The regular supermarket? â€œThatâ€™s disgusting. â€œI can tell from your skin, â€œâ€™cause itâ€™s splotchy and gross. â€œNo, I respect it. I just canâ€™t do it. â€œI only shop at Whole Foods and Trader Joeâ€™s. â€œThatâ€™s where I get my conflict-free M&Ms. Naaah. Naaah.â€ Iâ€™m done with the Whole Foods. Iâ€™m done with it. I like eating healthy. I do. But you have to be a billionaire to eat healthy? Iâ€™m not spending five bucks on an apple â€™cause you thought it was a good idea to ship it from Vermont by bicycle. â€œThen where you gonna get your kale? How you gonna get your kale?â€ I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t even know what it is. My grandmother never made it. My mother never saw it. It just showed up, like, a week and a half ago. But itâ€™s here now, and you got to eat it. Well, how do I know what it is? â€˜Cause it takes like mulch, and you feel like a koala bear when youâ€™re chewing on it. â€œAre you supposed to eat the stem? Oh, okay.â€ Hard to tell the eat part from the throw-out part. They get up to the register. They put on a whole show about their bags. â€œI have my own bags. â€œI want everyone here to know â€œI wouldnâ€™t use their bags. â€œI am an angel sent from heaven. â€œI wove my own bags out of human hair and seaweed.â€ Get over yourself. These people have driven me to Costco. Thatâ€™s the only place I shop now. I go to Costco. Yeah.
[cheers and applause]
Yeah. No one acts like theyâ€™re better than you at Costco. Everyone knows exactly who they are at Costco. â€œIâ€™m disgusting, and I need more stuff immediately. â€œAnd Iâ€™m making one trip. I brought the big car. This is my only weekend out.â€ Thereâ€™s a sense of community when you go to Costco, right? You canâ€™t go there by yourself. You can drive there alone. Youâ€™re gonna have to make some friends on your way in. You canâ€™t get a 25-pound salami on your back by yourself. Trying to throw it in your cart like the Scottish strongman competition. The place is so massive, they got to hand out little samples in cups to keep up your strength. Itâ€™s like a white trash marathon in that place. â€œHereâ€™s a fried baloney ball. Youâ€™re doing great.â€
[applause]
â€œThereâ€™s fried chicken popsicles, aisle ten. Youâ€™ll get there by Tuesday if you keep up the pace.â€ [chuckles] You get to the register. No oneâ€™s talking about bags at Costco. They donâ€™t even have bags. They have boxes with holes in it. â€œThere was a dead pig in this yesterday. â€œI donâ€™t know if that bothers you. â€œThe cardboardâ€™s a little wet. He was a bleeder.â€ And they know theyâ€™re not gonna live forever at Costco. They have coffins at the door. They literally sell coffins at the door, which sounds absurd until you look in your cart filled with Cheez-Its and Slim Jims. Youâ€™re like, â€œHow much longer can I live like this? â€œSeriously? â€œYou know what? Todayâ€™s the day. â€œIâ€™m buying a coffin today. â€œYou know what? Give me the coffin. â€œIâ€™m gonna use it as my box. Put all my stuff in there.â€ Wheel itâ€“
[laughs]
Look, I donâ€™t even blame you if youâ€™re one of the Costco people or the Whole Foods people. Itâ€™s not even up to you anymore, right? You go to a store once, they take so much information from you, you end up in this long-term relationship with these companies. Back off. I deal with human beings. Thatâ€™s enough. Iâ€™m not dating you, CVS. Every time I go to CVS, â€œDo you have your card? â€œDo you have your CVS card? Do you have your card?â€ â€œNo, for the tenth time this week. No, I donâ€™t have a card.â€ â€œYou donâ€™t have a card? â€œThis man doesnâ€™t have a card! â€œThis man doesnâ€™t have a card. Youâ€™ve got to join us.â€ People coming out of the back, â€œJoin us. Join us.â€ â€œNo, I donâ€™t want to join you. â€œI donâ€™t want anything on my keychain. â€œI didnâ€™t want to make eye contact with you, frankly. â€œI just want to sneak in here, get this ointment, go home, and deal with this.â€
[laughter] [applause]
â€œDo you take money? â€œIâ€™ll pay you money. â€œIâ€™ll pay you double if you let me leave. â€œI should be home with my pants off, solving this problem right now.â€ When you donâ€™t join up, they act like a psychotic girlfriend on your way out. â€œWell, how about your email or your phone number? â€œWeâ€™re not gonna use it; we just want to have it. â€œWe just want to smell it when youâ€™re not here, â€™cause we love you.â€ Back off. Check into the hotel, â€œWelcome back, Tom.â€ â€œWhoa, what do you mean, â€˜welcome backâ€™? â€œYou donâ€™t know me. â€œThatâ€™s why I stay with you. You donâ€™t know me. â€œI know people in town. I donâ€™t stay with them. â€œThey know me. â€œThis is our relationship: â€œI come in late at night, â€œI do weird stuff to your towels, â€œand I leave in the morning. Forget my name.â€ Every restaurant, they canâ€™t just come up to your table now. They got to bounce up there. â€œYou guys ever eaten here before? You guys ever eaten in an Outback Steakhouse before?â€ Just lie. â€œYeah, Iâ€™ve been here before.â€ They leave, and they get your drink. My wife likes to be honest. â€œNo, Iâ€™ve never been in one of these before. Whatâ€™s gonna happen?â€ Heâ€™s gonna do a show. Heâ€™s gonna do a goddamn show. â€œLet me tell you how it works. â€œWeâ€™re a little crazy at the Outback Steakhouse. â€œYou think youâ€™ve been eating your whole life, â€œchewing and swallowing? â€œThatâ€™s not what we do here. â€œYou order your appetizer, bring out a cannon, and we shoot it right in your face.â€ They all have their own credit card now. â€œDo you have your KFC MasterCard?â€ â€œWhat?â€ â€œDo you have your KFC MasterCard?â€ â€œNo, I donâ€™t have a chicken credit card in my wallet â€œwith a picture of a plantation owner on the side.â€ â€œWell, I could save you 15% of your purchase right now if you apply for a KFC MasterCard.â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™m sure the 25 people behind me â€œwouldnâ€™t mind me filling out some paperwork and running a credit check during their lunch half-hour.â€ I donâ€™t care about 15% of $8. I donâ€™t care. I just want to sit in the parking lot by myself, eat it quickly before my wife comes out of Banana Republic and sees Iâ€™m not following doctorâ€™s orders. Move it. â€œBut if you donâ€™t use the cards, â€œyouâ€™re not gonna get your points. â€œIf you donâ€™t get points, you wonâ€™t have status. Donâ€™t you want status?â€ Donâ€™t fall for it. Donâ€™t fall for it. Thereâ€™s no such thing as status. Itâ€™s all illusion. They try and fool you. Doesnâ€™t matter how many points you have, where you fly on the plane, what you drive. Weâ€™re all exactly the same: horrible animals running around in pants, trying to keep ourselves busy, fighting the overwhelming urge to mount each other and make smaller versions of ourselves.
[laughter and applause]
All the same. But they try and fool ya, right? Flying here, â€œOkay, weâ€™re gonna board your flight now. â€œNot everybody. Sit down. â€œNot all at once, you maniacs. â€œThereâ€™s some special people here â€œgetting on that plane first, â€™cause they have status. â€œWeâ€™re gonna start off with our diamond-crusted, â€œgold-plated, carbon fiber-based, Teflon-coated, â€œpremier, elite-access, super-duper Douchebag Flying Guy Club.â€ And the whole place stands up. Everybody has it. How special is it? Thereâ€™s one guy in the other lane with a crooked leg and a cane. â€œI have no status at all.â€ And he walks funny, so they board him first anyway. I travel a lot. I travel all the time. I was traveling a lot last year, and I took my family out with me. Figured that would be a good thing. That wasâ€“ what do you call that? A mistake. Thatâ€™s a mistake. That is not a good thing. You realize when you travel with your family, you donâ€™t really know these people all that well. When youâ€™re home, youâ€™re like bees in and out of a hive. You donâ€™t really hang out. And then you wake up that first morning in a hotel room just looking at each other. [chuckles] â€œYou guys are pretty weird, right? â€œDoes the little one always do that? â€œI didnâ€™t even know we had her. She doesnâ€™t look like any of us.â€ Big moment this year, though, during the travels. The kids, for the first time in their lives, wheeled their own luggage. Huge, huge milestone. â€˜Cause lookâ€“ yeah, itâ€™s big. Itâ€™s a big deal.
[applause]
Look, Iâ€™ve made my own people, right? Iâ€™ve made my own people. Iâ€™ve made two people, and I am their leader. I am their leader. So when they want to go somewhere, I have to plan it, because they donâ€™t know where anything is. They think New York and L.A. are right next to each other. I have to pay for everything, â€™cause they have no money or skills of any kind. But for years, I would have to carry everything that they owned, like a mule, like a human mule. They would literally load everything on my back and then sit on top of the pile like a small Peruvian lady, and I would just walk through the airport with canteens hitting my legs, just standing at the gate with flies in my eyes. And sometimes you see a donkey with flies in his eyes and you think, â€œWhy doesnâ€™t he get those flies out of his eyes?â€ Now I know. Iâ€™ve seen a donkeyâ€™s soul. He doesnâ€™t care about the flies. He hopes the fly eats through his eye and devours the part of his brain that feels and remembers. Oh, but this year, the handle went up, and they just walked ahead. I was crying in the airport, I was so happy. Still canâ€™t pack, though. We got to the hotel. The only thing there was a Curious George and some magnets. Really? Two weekâ€™s vacation. You thought that was gonna do it. All right. Hope you like that bathing suit. Youâ€™re gonna wear it a lot. And Iâ€™m still learning about my wife, still learning about my wife. Oh, I married a talker. I married a talker. 16 years together. Still coming up with new stuff to say every goddamn day. She starts from the minute she gets up till about a half-hour after she falls asleep. Just talksâ€¦ Sheâ€™ll talk to anybody. The housekeeper at the hotel doesnâ€™t speak any English at all. My wife doesnâ€™t care. â€œThen my mother said she didnâ€™t like my hair. Can you believe that?â€ This poor womanâ€™s like, â€œOh, no. Terrible.â€ Then we come home. She starts talking to the cats. Cats, they donâ€™t speak any language at all. My wife just sees two ears, like, â€œI should fill those with talking noises. â€œHow many times have I told you not to go on the counter? We talk about this every day.â€ Catâ€™s like, â€œMeow, meow. Thatâ€™s terrible. Meow.â€
[laughs]
Went to Disney for the first time, a trip to Disney. That was, uhâ€“ that was rough. That was rough. That is not a good place. They call it â€œthe happiest place on Earth.â€ For who? For who? Ugh! Look, I love the idea. I love the idea that this man created something out of his own head. He just wanted to create a nice little place where families can go and kids can let their imagination run wild and feel safe for a couple hours in this horrible world. Beautiful idea. But what he couldnâ€™t foresee when he was developing it in 1950 was the type of people it was going to attract in 2016 in the United States of America, â€™cause they didnâ€™t make these kind of people back then. There werenâ€™t dinosaur-sized people stomping through the park with their elephant children attached to their tailâ€¦ Pushing the biggest strollers Iâ€™ve ever seen. I had no idea John Deere made strollers. One woman had five kids in it. Fiâ€“I neverâ€“I donâ€™t know what you even call that. A pentalometer? A jumbotron? Five pumpkin-faced kids eating cheeseburgers, and sheâ€™s plowing through the crowd, knocking other families out of the way like tumbleweeds just so she can get to the churro stand first. Then there are people there, women, who have no children at all, who want to be a princess themselves. Grown women who want to be a princess. They want to dress like Cinderella, but they donâ€™t make a Cinderella dress for someone 48 years old, 6â€™5â€³, 380. They never had a meeting and said, â€œLetâ€™s make more of those.â€ Does that stop them? No, it does not. They buy that dress. They stuff everything they have into it, and a lot doesnâ€™t fit. Thereâ€™s a lot of extra hanging over the sides. But thatâ€™s okay. Theyâ€™re happy there. They have their autograph book and their wand, and they skip through the park. Fine. Honestly, I didnâ€™t think I was gonna fall for it. I didnâ€™t. I didnâ€™t think we were gonna do. I didnâ€™t. But once you make your own people, the ads just find you. Every time you open your phone, open your laptop, turn on TV, there they are, just selling you joy and perfection, right? Every time you turn it on, the mom and dad are beautiful, perfect teeth and hair, clothes. â€œI love you.â€ â€œNo, I love you.â€ â€œYouâ€™re beautiful.â€ â€œNo, youâ€™re beautiful.â€ â€œOur kids are beautiful.â€ And the kids are holding Mickeyâ€™s hand, looking back at the parents. â€œThanks, Mom and Dad, for not being stupid and poor.â€ Iâ€™ll admit it; I wanted to be that family. I wanted to be that family. We were not that family. We didnâ€™t come close. We were not perfect. We were sweaty and pissed off and cursing in front of the children. â€œThis is your damn fault. â€œIf your parents didnâ€™t raise you like an animal, we would have left a little bit earlier.â€ And the kids donâ€™t even hear us, â€™cause theyâ€™re slapping each other in the face. And we havenâ€™t even parked yet. We havenâ€™t even parked. Weâ€™re still in the van. Weâ€™re pissed off â€™cause we didnâ€™t get to park in Mickey and Minnie parking. They sent us with that big hand to the ass end of Chip and Dale parking. Thatâ€™s another tram ride we didnâ€™t plan for. Then you get to the front of the park. I know itâ€™s a clichÃ©, but you get up there. You open your wallet. They take everything you got. Everythingâ€“ every dollar, every coin, every credit card, gym memberships, pictures of your family, unused condoms. That mouse rapes you at the turnstile, and you have to plaster a smile on your face in front of your kids, â€™cause you donâ€™t want to ruin the happiest place on Earth. â€œItâ€™s gonna be a greatâ€¦ day, guys. Itâ€™s really gonna be a lot of fun.â€ Then you get inside. Itâ€™s just line after line after line. I thought I was gonna beat it. I had the app on my phone. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m gonna beat â€™em.â€ No, youâ€™re not beating Disney. Iâ€™m like, â€œLetâ€™s go on the Peter Pan ride. â€œThatâ€™s a horrible ride from 1912. â€œLook, no one wants to even go on it. The line only goes back and forth two times.â€ Yeah, up here. Then they take you to the basement. It loops around for three days. Then they shoot you out the ass end. It goes around the Matterhorn 12 times. And itâ€™s a bad ride. Itâ€™s a bad ride. Old cardboard cutouts, Christmas lights that donâ€™t even work anymore. All the voices are jumbled. [distorted] â€œIâ€™m Tinker Bell. Iâ€™m Tinker Bell.â€ 2 1/2 hours! Was it worth it? No. What would be worth it? Nothing. I get to the end of that line, there could be naked supermodels with bags of money and all-you-can-eat nachos. Iâ€™d be like, â€œNo, not into it. You lied to me.â€ [chuckles] Hereâ€™s what I learned, though. Hereâ€™s what I learned. If you go ahead and goâ€“and if you make your own people, youâ€™re gonna have to goâ€“ you just want to go once. You want to go once, so you got to blow it out, make it all about the kids, go big. Give â€™em your money. â€œHereâ€™s $300 cash, kids. â€œSpend it the way you want to spend it. Itâ€™s your day.â€ And halfway up Main Street, theyâ€™ll be broke, â€™cause theyâ€™re small, and theyâ€™re stupid and gullible. And theyâ€™re going to buy a lot of blinking stuff thatâ€™s not gonna work by the time they get outside. And now theyâ€™re laying in the gutter of Main Street like little Disney hobos, broken toys, crying, just yelling at the characters. â€œGet over here, duck, and shake your ass. I got nothing left.â€ Make sure you fill them with sugar, a lot of sugar. Make them tweak out on sugar. Donâ€™t even have to wear sunblock. â€œHow about that, kids? â€œYou hate when I put it on you. â€œI donâ€™t want to put it on you. â€œDonâ€™t wear it. I bet you donâ€™t even burn in Disney.â€ They do burn, especially when theyâ€™re little. They turn purple, and they start to blister. And now theyâ€™re crying. They got broken toys. Theyâ€™re crashing on sugar. And this is when you walk â€™em. You got to walk the hell out of â€™em. Give â€™em the map. â€œAnywhere you want to go.â€ â€œOh, you want to go from the Cars ride â€œto Itâ€™s a Small World? â€œSure, 20 miles apart. Letâ€™s start walking.â€ Midnight rolls around. Theyâ€™ve been on two rides the whole day. Weâ€™ll never go back again. My kids see that mouse now, they shake like they went to war with it.
[applause]
I like moving around, especially by myself. You get to see a lot of people, and itâ€™s inspirational. You know, people are good, and theyâ€™re kind, and they look out for each other. Andâ€“yeah, I actually like people more the older I get. When I was younger, I didnâ€™t like people so much, and now, you know, you realize, â€œWeâ€™re all the same, you know?â€ You pee on your own leg more than three times a week. Youâ€™re like, â€œHow great am I?â€ You know? And thatâ€™s another thing I donâ€™t understand about the wealth. I mean, whatâ€™s the thing? Whatâ€™s the goal? To just get so much money, you isolate yourself from everybody else? Just go from your helicopter to your island and back to your place? Why? Weâ€™re only here once. You got to mix it up, you know? Look, Iâ€™m not Pollyannaish about it. I mean, sometimes I get around people in a crowd, I wish I had my own helicopter. Not just to fly away. I would turn it upside down and chop everyoneâ€™s head off.
[laughter and applause]
Sometimes. But for the most part, people are cool, and they look out for each other, and itâ€™s nice, you know? And the only bad part: it only takes one person who doesnâ€™t know how to act among us to ruin the good time of everyone else, some disgusting behavior, and it ruins the good time of everybody, â€™cause theyâ€™re breaking the human contract, which is very simple. Youâ€™re abiding by it right now. So when we get around each other, just turn it down a notch. Donâ€™t do publicly what you like to do privately. When youâ€™re alone, it gets kind of weird. Thatâ€™s okay. Youâ€™re an animal. Thereâ€™s only so long you can not put a finger in one of your openings. Thatâ€™s okay. Hey, you got a job to do. They donâ€™t make tools for everything you got to get done. Fine. Right now, thereâ€™s someone in here that likes filling up his pants with Cheez Doodles and dancing around like a pretty pony. And heâ€™s not doing it. Heâ€™s fighting the urge until he gets home. And we respect you for that, sir. We thank you. And I guarantee you itâ€™s a sir. I guarantee you. These other people donâ€™t care. They think the whole world centers around them, disgusting people. They just walk around peeing on things, farting everywhere, letting their dogs go all over your lawn, blowing their nose in the air. Have you ever been around that guy? What the hell? What isâ€“ what goes on in your head where you think, â€œIâ€™ve got something in my noseâ€ and the other part of your brain says, â€œBlow it out of your face nowâ€? And theyâ€™re good at it, which means they practice. Awful people, disgusting people, the same people that curse in front of children, donâ€™t give up their seat for old people, donâ€™t hold the door open for womenâ€“ awful people. Theyâ€™re the same people that bring their own smelly-ass food on planes. They apparently think theyâ€™re flying alone, and they bring this smelly-ass food that they made in a disgusting laboratory they call a kitchen. Awful. You know who these people are, by the way, â€™cause theyâ€™re the ones walking through the airport carrying their own pillow from their bed. Thatâ€™s a psychopath. If youâ€™re a grown-up and you take your pillow out of your bedroom, you better stop at the couch, and you better have the flu. You open the door and take it out into the world with you, you should be caught with a net, and we should never see you again. â€œGoing on a big trip today. â€œWhatâ€™s that? Youâ€™re so right, pillow. Youâ€™re so right.â€ Look, I donâ€™t think there should be food on a plane at all. How about that, chubsy? How about that? Can you survive without a sandwich? Can you do it? During the Great Depression, we ate nothing but rusty nails and dirt for years. Can you make it to Boise without a sandwich? All right, maybe Iâ€™m insensitive. Maybe you have a tapeworm that needs feeding. I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on inside your gut. But then be nice, something non-offensive. How about an apple, maybe some trail mix? The last flight I was on, a guy broke out a tuna fish and dead skunk ass sandwich. I donâ€™t know what part of Whole Foods has that, but this guy found it, chopped it up with tuna and mayo, and put it on rye. And he waited till the doors were shut and weâ€™re at 10,000 feet. He released this stink bomb like it was a planned attack. You ever smell something so bad that you just get confused? Your head snaps back. You make little circles with your hands. You just blurt something out. â€œRoosevelt!â€ [panting] â€œJust keep breathing out. Just breathe out, out.â€ â€œItâ€™s too late. I breathed in. Itâ€™s in me. I breathed in. I messed up. Itâ€™s in me. I can taste it. I can taste it.â€ People were opening their air vents just to get air from somewhere else. â€œOh! Oh! I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s from the engine. Oh!â€ People were putting their faces in strangersâ€™ armpits for relief. You know what kills me about these situations? All the good people, the social tension of all the nice, cool people. How many other people on the flight? 200? 300 people? So nice, so kind. They donâ€™t even complain. They just sit there and suffer in silence. Youâ€™ve never been in that situation and have a guy pop up at the back. â€œAre you kidding me? â€œNo, honey, let me go. This has to be said. â€œ7:00 in the morning, skunk ass. â€œScrew you! Oh, Iâ€™m the bad guy. All right, all right.â€
[cheers and applause]
Never. The most you get, people just roll their eyes and whisper. â€œPee-yew, he smells. I think itâ€™s skunk ass. I would never do that. Thatâ€™s terrible.â€ Iâ€™ve got two people that I made. Iâ€™ve got two kids. And theyâ€™re going through a weird phase. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a weird phase. Itâ€™s justâ€“my kids are finally realizing Iâ€™m not as great as they thought. You know what I mean? Like, for years, I was their god. They were amazed by everything I did. â€œHe gets food. I donâ€™t know how he does it.â€ â€œThatâ€™s nothing; I saw him lift a chair over his head by himself.â€ â€œWow!â€ â€œI know!â€ The other day, I was yelling at â€™em. I mixed up their names. They shot me a look like, â€œOh. Maybe our leaderâ€™s an idiot. Maybe heâ€™s not kidding when he says he canâ€™t help with our math homework.â€ And theyâ€™re not wrong. I canâ€™t help them anymore. I donâ€™t understand it. But I have to act like itâ€™s a parenting decision for my own ego. Theyâ€™ll be like, â€œDad, can you help me with my math homework?â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™m not giving you the answers. This is between you and your teacher. Work it out.â€ Then Iâ€™m in the bathroom on YouTube, â€œHow do you add fractions with different bottoms? â€œOh, you just got to make them the same.â€ â€œHow?â€ â€œUhâ€¦â€
[laughs]
[sighs] My daughter got in the car the other day. She reached over my shoulder. She hit the radio. A whole Taylor Swift station came on that she reprogrammed herself. Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, when did you do that?â€ And I change it. A Katy Perry station comes on. She hijacked the whole radio. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhen did you do that?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œDonâ€™t worry about it. Just make it louder.â€ Could you imagine? I couldnâ€™t imagine, as a child, getting in my fatherâ€™s car, demanding my music, and then, â€œLouder. Lower. A little louder. Right there, Chief. Right there.â€ When I eventually came out of my coma, they would have told me a story of how arrogant I was and why I lost five years of my life when I was hit in the head with a pipe. And as the only man in my house, itâ€™s my job to maintain my importance in the family by teaching my daughters that there are no great guys. Thatâ€™s my job: to teach my daughters there are no great guys.
[scattered applause]
Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, thereâ€™s a lot of guys applauding that. You know. Thereâ€™s no great guys. If you think youâ€™re with a great guy tonight, youâ€™re not. Look, American men are as great as youâ€™re gonna get. We fight for equality, and we push strollers. We wear diaper bags. We tell you we want equal pay. But keep in mind itâ€™s an act. Itâ€™s an act. Because inside all of us is a 16h-century man who wants to burn the village to the ground. Heâ€™s always in there, so just keep that in mind. If you have a man, you have a wild animal. This is a wild animal, so use him wisely. Youâ€™re in control, so donâ€™t do stupid things with your man. Donâ€™t ask us to do certain things. Donâ€™t be stupid. Donâ€™t ask us to watch the children. What are you doing? Weâ€™re not really watching the children, not the way you watch the children. We watch them eat bottle caps and fall down stairs. And we laugh. Donâ€™t ask me to shop with my 13-year-old. I shouldnâ€™t be shopping for clothes. I shouldnâ€™t be in Forever 21, waiting for my daughter to come out of the dressing room. No one there knows I have a daughter in the dressing room. They just see a sweaty, uncomfortable man breathing heavy by himself next to the bras and panties. And I shouldnâ€™t pick the young one up from gymnastics. No dad should be picking up his daughter from gymnastics. I shouldnâ€™t be hanging out with the other moms, waiting for it to be over. Theyâ€™re all talking about juice boxes and play dates. All Iâ€™m thinking is, â€œWhich one of these moms would I have sex with first?â€ Iâ€™m being honest. Thatâ€™s where our head goes. Not which one would I have sex with, by the way, â€™cause Iâ€™d have sex with all of them. The weird one, the one with the thing on her eye, Iâ€™ll make it work. I can make it work. But which one first, while Iâ€™ve got the energy? Thatâ€™s my job, try and give them lessons, but itâ€™s hard, because the real world starts coming in, right? And they start learning about the real world. I try to protect them, but they start learning about all the good and the bad thatâ€™s out in the world, and itâ€™s funny in my house, â€™cause theyâ€™re learning about it at different rates. You know, like, we learned about Thanksgiving, and the little oneâ€™s like, â€œOh, we love Thanksgiving. â€œWe love the Indians. We gave them our buckle hats and our shoes and a turkey, and they gave us some feathers and some mashed potatoes, and we had dinner with them, and they love us, and we love them.â€ And the 13-year-oldâ€™s just leaning against the refrigerator. â€œWhatâ€™s this Trail of Tears Iâ€™m hearing about? We took their land and then moved them out west, then took their land again and then killed them all?â€ And the little oneâ€™s like, â€œItâ€™s not the same Indians, right, Dad?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, itâ€™s the same Indians.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œWhy did we do that?â€ â€œOh, easy with the â€˜we,â€™ first of all. Weâ€™re the Papas. Weâ€™re Italian. We got here in 1945. We eat spaghettis and ride Vespas. Weâ€™re lovers.â€
[laughs]
But itâ€™s hopeful to see this generation, â€™cause they justâ€“they justâ€“ you know, theyâ€™re more tolerant, and itâ€™s not even tolerant; they donâ€™t have to tolerate it. They donâ€™t even know that things are bad or that they hate each other. Theyâ€™re just nice and nice people, and itâ€™s very hopeful. They donâ€™t even see race. They donâ€™t say â€œblack peopleâ€ or â€œwhite people.â€ They just say â€œdarkerâ€ or â€œmuch darkerâ€ or â€œwhiterâ€ or â€œmuch whiterâ€ or â€œgross.â€ Thatâ€™s how they talk. The first time my daughter ever heard about race, she saw â€œThe Jackie Robinson Story,â€ and that really blew her away. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWait a minute. â€œAre you telling me that white people had to let the black people play baseball?â€ I was like, â€œYeah, thatâ€™s how it happened for a while.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œNo, no, no way. â€œIsnâ€™t it the black people who let the white people play sports?â€
[applause]
Sheâ€™s likeâ€“sheâ€™s like, â€œâ€˜Cause Iâ€™ve seen some of our white people play basketball. We shouldnâ€™t do that.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, they let us play once in a while. â€œThey also let us make music, and thatâ€™s where country comes from.â€
[laughs]
The only reason I want a son is because thatâ€™s the only thing ruining our good time on the planet. The only time someone loses it and does something awful, 100% of the time, itâ€™s a guy. And I donâ€™t get it, â€™cause I was a manâ€¦ for a while. I was, before I built this vagina tribe that I live in. You really canâ€™t be a man in the vagina tribe. You canâ€™t. I watch the play-offs, but people are putting bows in my hair and doing my nails at the same time. No, angry young men, I really donâ€™t get it. Just calm down, guys. Calm down. You feel like a loser? Thatâ€™s okay. We all do. We all do. Youâ€™re not missing out on anything. Weâ€™re all losers. Weâ€™re human beings. You get little moments of victories, and most of the time, you lose. Thatâ€™s okay. Thatâ€™s the way the whole world works. Travel all around. Everyoneâ€™s exactly the same. Thank God youâ€™re not that happy, or I wouldnâ€™t have a job. Youâ€™d just sit at home and call your friends. â€œHa-ha ha ha ha. Life is wonderful.â€ No, you have to pay for your laughter, and I am your prostitute.
[cheers and applause]
Itâ€™s okay. Iâ€™m happy to do it. But come on. Youâ€™re a young man. Get your life in order. Just get anything. Get a guitar. Get a skateboard. Get a girl. Get a girl. Youâ€™re 19. Get an 18-year-old girl. Thatâ€™s the only age that wonâ€™t sound creepy. 19, everything is working full bore. Thatâ€™s not gonna last. You think everyoneâ€™s with supermodels? No. Lower the bar. Lower the bar. Any woman will soothe your soul. Go to a bowling alley. Go to a bowling alley. Go to the back of the bowling alley. Thereâ€™s a deep fryer in the back of the bowling alley. Thereâ€™s a girl working that deep fryer. Thatâ€™s your girl. Sheâ€™ll be a ton of fun. Youâ€™ll get fries and onion rings on the side. Get a cougar. That didnâ€™t exist when I was 19. There werenâ€™t hot, middle-aged women looking for young men to violate. Theyâ€™re out there now in force. Go to any ladiesâ€™ night in any Holiday Inn in Any City, USA. Walk out on the dance floor. Push all the 50-year-old douche bags in their Tommy Bahama out of the way. Raise your arms. â€œIâ€™m 19.â€ They will rape you on the dance floor. And look, there are angry young women out there. Thereâ€™s a lot of angry young women. But they donâ€™t blow stuff up. They just terrorize one guy at a time. They pick one guy out, and they just ruin his life. Itâ€™s not nice, but itâ€™s better for the community as a whole. [laughs] But weâ€™re gonna be just fine. And look, look. You have to vote for the right people that are gonna do the right things, and if they donâ€™t do the right things, then you just get them out. Thatâ€™s just the way it goes. Donâ€™t stress about it. Move it along. Thatâ€™s the way it goes, â€™cause itâ€™s their job. They got to deal with that stuff. We canâ€™t do it. Weâ€™re busy. Weâ€™re busy, all right? I canâ€™t go out and fight ISIS. My house is crazy. I got enough to deal with in my house, right? You got all your stuff to do. You got to watch LeBron run around. Youâ€™ve got to go to games. Weâ€™re busy. Weâ€™re busy people. I canâ€™t fight ISIS. Neither can you. One of my cats just died. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m dealing with. Yeah. Well, we had three, so two to go. No, I love cats. I love that level of intimacy. I wish my kids were more like cats. That would be perfect. Oh, my God. And please, if I could just leave food for them once a week and they brush against my leg to let me know theyâ€™re alive, perfect. Perfect. I donâ€™t even know why we have these animals. Do you? It makes no sense. All these years of engineering and walls and electricity to keep nature out. Then we just open the door like a bouncer. â€œYou two, come on in. No, not you, squirrel, you coke addict. Get out of here.â€ Then you have an animal just sitting on your counter, looking at you. I was watching TV the other day. My cat, looking at me, dropped its ass, back legs up, front paws, just started pulling itself straight at me, six feet across. Didnâ€™t break eye contact the entire time. Stared me down. â€œThatâ€™s right. My ass in your carpet. What of it? What you gonna do about it, go in my box? I donâ€™t think so. Whoâ€™s scooping it out? Not me. Never have, never will.â€
[cheers and applause]
Itâ€™s a crazy house. 16 years putting this whole thing together, and it works. I wish you the same success. I really do. And the family is a good thing. 16 years in the family, 16 years with the same woman, the same person. Good thing. [cheers and applause] Itâ€™s good, and it works. But itâ€™s time for a girlfriend. Itâ€™s definitely time for a girlfriend. Itâ€™s not fair. Itâ€™s not fair to my wife. Itâ€™s not fair to this woman to expect her to act like a girlfriend for this long; itâ€™s not. Look, when youâ€™re a girlfriend, youâ€™re motivated. Youâ€™re excited to see that guy come home. My wife is not that good of an actress. This poor woman has watched me walk from the bedroom to the bathroom in the middle of the night, underwear hanging off my ass, banging into furniture in the dark, for 16 years. How could I expect her to be like, â€œOh, goody, I hope he hurries backâ€?
[cheers and applause]
Iâ€™m out of stories. Iâ€™ve run out of stories. You ever hang out with a married couple, the guy starts telling a story, the wife just starts stirring her drink and rolling her eyes? â€œHere we go again. Blah, blah, blah. Weâ€™ve all heard it, Don. Weâ€™ve all heard it.â€ Weâ€™re entering that stage. Iâ€™m a comedian. She doesnâ€™t think Iâ€™m funny. Itâ€™s time for a girlfriend. And look, Iâ€™m not gonna be sneaky about it. Iâ€™m not gonna cheat. Iâ€™m gonna sit her down. Iâ€™m gonna tell her my plans straight out. Iâ€™ll be like, â€œLook, I found a girl. â€œSheâ€™s young, and sheâ€™s dumb. Sheâ€™s just what we need. She hasnâ€™t heard any of my stories. She thinks Iâ€™m hilarious. She wants to fool around all the time. Donâ€™t think of her as my girlfriend. Think of her as your assistant.â€
Thank you so much, Cleveland. You guys were wonderful. Thank you so much.
[cheers and applause]

â™ª
Thank you very much.
Yes indeed.
You look great.
It looks like you lost weight. Good for you. You look nice. Sincerely, many, many thanks. It means a lot that youâ€™re here. A big round of applause for the Tom Papa dancers. Thank you so much. Really means a lot. It really does.
Hereâ€™s why I donâ€™t like the Chinese. Not some of them, all of them. Iâ€™m scared of the Chinese. Iâ€™m scared of the Chinese. And I know fear comes from ignorance, and I am ignorant of that culture. But Iâ€™ll bet most of you are ignorant of the Chinese culture. Go to Chinatown, and go to a grocery store, and look at what they consider food. And you tell me you understand the Chinese. Bags of salted squirrel faces. Baby alligators this big, this big. Iâ€™ve never seen an alligator this big. Not on the Internet. Not on discovery. Not in a museum. Itâ€™s like they donâ€™t exist. Go to Chinatown, thereâ€™s boxes filled with them with scoopers like youâ€™re getting gummy bears at the fair. Thereâ€™s always a fish tank out front with black water in it. You think nothingâ€™s in it. You come up, tap on the glass. Something comes up, spits at you, yells, and goes back down. Was that a fish or a man? Are they selling it or does he work here?
All right, all right, what other culture has buckets of live frogs out front of every storefront? Who? And not just the food store. The bank, the electronics store. Everyone in Chinatown is in the live frog business. Well, letâ€™s educate ourselves. Letâ€™s not be so ignorant. Letâ€™s learn a little bit. Weâ€™ll take six, please. Give us six live frogs. They bag â€™em up for you. You get â€™em home to your place. Whatâ€™s your next move? How are you killing six live frogs on your own? Are you just gonna get little pillows and put â€™em over their face? Let it go, froggy. Let it go. I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t have the answers. Who you gonna ask for answers in those stores? Whoâ€™s there to help you in those stores?
One 2,000-year-old woman sitting on a milk crate chewing on a bat wing. A Bengal tiger in a hammock just swinging behind her, eyeballing you the whole time. You go to the register. No people at the register. Just cats. Cats working the register. Smoking cigarettes, playing scratch-off lottery games, eating fig Newtons with no labels on them. Scary, scary people. And we owe them $4 trillion.
Gay men scare me. Gay men scare me because they care about the same things that women care about, but with the aggression of men. Itâ€™s a dangerous combination. Like if my wife sees a friend of hers whoâ€™s gained a little weight, sheâ€™ll rip her apart but be very tactful about it. You know, â€œlooks like Barbara â€œmight have put on a pound or two. Bah, bah, bah, bah.â€ Our gay friendâ€™s like, â€œplease, sheâ€™s a walrus.â€ â€œLook at her whiskers.â€ Like, women will redecorate maybe a room or two. Maybe a half bath if they get excited.
Gay men will redecorate an entire city if they donâ€™t like it. I live in Chelsea here in town. It was a hellhole. It was rat-infested, graffiti-covered. And when the gay community finally moved in, they got to Chelsea looked around and said, â€œhell no. This will not do.â€ And they dressed up like construction workers in jeans and work bootsâ€¦ Suspenders and no shirts. And they tore that place to the ground. And what has emerged is a pottery barn heaven. Everywhere you go it smells like candles. Gay men make everything better. Yeah, that should be their slogan.
This is a pretty amazing time to be here. Itâ€™s probably the greatest time to be on this planet. It really is. We are very lucky people. But we donâ€™t always feel that way. We always feel freaked out all the time, â€™cause weâ€™re the first generation of people whoâ€™s had to watch news 24 hours a day. No other human being has had to watch a nonstop horror show of other peopleâ€™s problems. Itâ€™s too much. You gotta turn it off. Itâ€™ll make you sick. You gotta treat the news like a call home to your parents. Shorter the better. Right, you call, you make it short, like, they tell you something weird your dad did with a jar of mayonnaise andâ€¦ â€œI love you. I love you.â€ You hang up. How are they? Theyâ€™re good, theyâ€™re good. Theyâ€™re doing just fine. Because it skews our thinking.
This is an amazing time to be here, you know? Weâ€™re the people of the 21st century. The 21st century, thatâ€™s a pretty amazing thing. But we have to own it. We have to own it. We gotta let the past go. We gotta make some changes. No more post office. Itâ€™s time to shut it down. I can send a picture of my testicles to all of Russia from my phone. Shut it down. Whoâ€™s communicating like this anymore? Iâ€™ve got to get a message to my friend in Virginia. Get me some paper and my writinâ€™ sticks. â€œDear Mortimer, send help immediately.â€ How we gonna get it there? I know, letâ€™s give it to the weirdo in the blue uniform who wanders the neighborhood and stares at the children too long. Heâ€™ll know what to do with it. Shut it down. Have you been inside a post office lately? Even the people who work in the post office canâ€™t believe itâ€™s still open. Itâ€™s like a haunted Scooby Doo warehouse at this point. Everythingâ€™s covered in spider webs. Old machinery run by enslaved Oompa Loompas. You get to the front of the line, they look at you like youâ€™re selling something and you just walked into their apartment. â€œWhat the hell are you doing here?â€ â€œI wanna send this to my Nana.â€ Then they go into a list of stuff they canâ€™t do for you. â€œWell, I canâ€™t send it wrapped like that. â€œI canâ€™t let you pay with that credit card. â€œI canâ€™t make eye contact with you when Iâ€™m talking to you. I canâ€™t stop eating Funyuns when Iâ€™m at work.â€ Shut it down.
While weâ€™re at it, no more change. No more disease-infested coins. Itâ€™s 2013. I can go to Starbucks with my iPhone and buy things like Captain Kirk with a phaser just pointing at stuff. Iâ€™ll take a latte. Pew! Iâ€™ll take a scone. Pew-pew! Why are we walking around like leprechauns with pockets filled with golden trinkets, jingle-jangling down the city streets, teasing the homeless. Why? You run your errands, you have to wear a belt just to keep your pants up from all the treasure youâ€™re gonna accumulate from your magic Mario Brothers adventure, â€™cause they love giving it out. Nothing ends on the dollar amount, right? 5.15, bling, bling, bling. 6.29, bling, bling, bling. You ever get 99 cents change? Thatâ€™s a big F.U., isnâ€™t it? â€˜Cause you know they donâ€™t have to do it. You donâ€™t have to do it. Youâ€™re gonna do it? Arenâ€™t you hilarious. Thank you very much. This will be all over my bedroom floor when I take my pants off tonight.
21st century. I say we give NASA one more year. One more year to make space travel exciting again, and if they canâ€™t pull it off we close them up and give the whole thing to Red Bull. Right? How dare you make space travel a snoozefest. You land on Mars, and you make it so boring that weâ€™re more interested in watching Antiques Roadshow. â€œWow, I didnâ€™t know they had an ice cream scooper â€œin the 1700s. â€œMaybe we should look in grammyâ€™s attic andâ€ â€œdid you hear we landed on Mars?â€ â€œI donâ€™t care.â€ â€˜Cause after all these years, they blow it. We donâ€™t land on Mars. They land a remote-control car on Mars. You ever been at Christmas and someone gets a remote-control car? Itâ€™s fun for one person, whoever has the remote. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening now. Thereâ€™s one guy in Pasadena at the controls. â€œIâ€™m on Mars! This is awesome! Itâ€™s mine, all mine!â€
They call it The Rover. The Rover. What kinda lame-ass name is The Rover? Donâ€™t you have a marketing department or someone under the age of 96. The Rover. Roverâ€™s touching down. Explore away, Rover. Godspeed, Rover. Why isnâ€™t anyone watching Rover? Because this is America. Redneck it up a little bit. Call it â€œThe Planet Crusher.â€ Put some flames on the side and some naked chick mud flaps. You land on Mars, a big laser gun comes out, just starts firing. Bwhowm! Bwhowm! Make up some stories about space creatures. How are we gonna know youâ€™re lying? Theyâ€™re green and theyâ€™re fast. Theyâ€™re everywhere. Bwhowm! But weâ€™ll get â€™em. Weâ€™re NASA, â€œnuking asshole space aliens.â€ And have the whole thing sponsored by Budweiser and Hooters.
But it is an exciting time to be alive. It really is. Things are getting better, they say. They say things are getting better. They say the economyâ€˜s improving. I donâ€™t know, â€™cause I donâ€™t understand it. Apparently nobody does. You know, even the people who run it, even the people who report on it have no clue on whatâ€™s going on with the economy. You wake up at 9:00 in the morning, theyâ€™re like, â€œeverythingâ€™s great.â€ By noon, â€œweâ€™re all going down!â€ What did they say? Why? And I try, I read the articles. Iâ€™m not an idiot. I read every day about the economy. Itâ€™s like drinking Jagermeister reading these articles. Itâ€™s like two paragraphs in, Iâ€™m just passed out on the kitchen floor. I wake up six hours later with no pants on. â€œWhoâ€™s Dow Jones? I feel weird.â€
Nobody understands it. Thatâ€™s why the whole occupy Wall Street thing fell on its ass. They didnâ€™t even know what they were fighting for. â€œWe want it now!â€ â€œAll right, what do you want?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know! â€œMaybe a tent and a razor for my girlfriend. I donâ€™t know.â€ I would pass it all the time with my daughter. Weâ€™d be walking through the park, she was like, â€œwhatâ€™s going on? Whatâ€™s this crowd?â€ And I was like, â€œwell, look, thereâ€™s a great economic disparity â€œbetween the really rich and the really poor, and theyâ€™re protesting against it.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œwell, what does that mean?â€ I said, â€œthat means we have to get really rich really fast â€œand get with the winning team. â€œOr youâ€™re gonna be playing hacky sack in this park for the rest of your life.â€ My brother-in-law was like, â€œthatâ€™s not cool. The poor are gonna get you.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œwell, theyâ€™re not gonna get in my gated community, â€œso I donâ€™t know how thatâ€™s gonna happen. â€œIâ€™m not giving them the code. Are you giving them the code?â€
Twitter built that movement, and Twitter killed that movement, by the way. It worked great for six months. It was a good way to organize. And then the cops were like, â€œwhy arenâ€™t we following them on Twitter?â€ And then they start showing up, like, an hour early. Everyone come in the park, â€œhow did they know?â€ And I know this is how it ended, because Iâ€™m a white guy and I can totally walk up to cops in the park and be like, â€œwhat the hell is going on here?â€ And they have to tell me. Itâ€™s awesome. â€œYou better fix it.â€ â€œWe will, sir, we will.â€
Itâ€™s a good color to be if you wanna mess with the man. Itâ€™sâ€¦ we donâ€™t look that great, weâ€™re pasty, and we burn easy, but the man doesnâ€™t really mess with you. Same when I fly, my friends are like, â€œhow do you deal with security all the time? It must suck.â€ Are you kidding? You should see the look of relief in the TSAâ€™s face when I get to the front of the line. They always pull me out for the search. Itâ€™s not even a search, itâ€™s like a meet and greet. We take pictures and exchange phone numbers. I point out all the weirdoes behind me who I think might be trouble. â€œIâ€™ve never seen a hat like that before, Iâ€™m just saying.â€
Also 99%, 1%, that killed that movement too. We donâ€™t like to be pit against each other. Also we donâ€™t like to be clumped all together. 99%, weâ€™re all the same. Not in this country, no, no, no. I was just in Alabama doing shows not long ago, and if you do the math weâ€™re supposed to be part of the same 99%. We are not. Youâ€™re not either. I mean, maybe weâ€™re not rich. We donâ€™t eat food with our feet. There should be, like, a 40% that we can be a part of, you know? You can make a little money, you spend it on things like shampoo and belts and birth control.
Look, the worldâ€™s always stressful. Thereâ€™s always problems. We all have our problems. We have problems. Thereâ€™s a lot of problems. But Iâ€™ll take our problems over any in history. Really, I think we just didnâ€™t get everything we thought we were gonna get. You know, itâ€™s, like, I wanted everything in the pottery barn catalogue. I only got a couple pages. Wah! Really? Tell that to some people who lived through World War II. 14 million people dead. Hitler running around Europe. Yeah, but I canâ€™t download movies as fast as I want to. Keeps rebuffering, I hate that.
I donâ€™t think I would have survived any other time in history, I really donâ€™t. I donâ€™t think I would have made it. Could you? Civil War. Could you have lived through the Civil War? No way. The Civil War. Brother on brother, stabbing each other in the guts. All before band-aids, by the way. Yeah, back then you got stabbed, you took wood chips and shoved â€™em in your hole. You laid in a field, played a rusty flute and waited for help. â€œIs that you, Walt Whitman?â€ â™ª boo ba doo, ba doo, ba doo â™ª
Just little stuff I couldnâ€™t have survived without. Electricity, the little things. Refrigeration. Could you have survived with just that, no refrigeration? We lost our power for a week, we were almost eating each other. No refrigeration, forget it. No frozen burritos for you, no, no. No ice cream. No ice cream! Why even live, right? Why be on the planet? You got cream back then. It came out of a smelly beast that lived outside your non-air-conditioned shack. Could you imagine? Thatâ€™s your dessert when youâ€™re a kid. You choked down your turnips, you dad would line you up on the lawn, grab an udder and squirt it in your face. â€œThank you, father. Can I have some more?â€ â€œYou sure can, Jacob. Youâ€™re a good boy.â€ â€œWeâ€™re so lucky to be alive.â€
Thereâ€™s always gonna be stress. You could turn off everything. Thatâ€™s why you gotta enjoy it. You gotta take every moment you can. I mean, this is it. This is the goodâ€¦ This is primetime. This is it for us. This is as good as itâ€™s gonna get. Itâ€™s not gonna get better. This is it. Youâ€™re gonna get old and weird really soon. This is it. This is primetime. You gotta take whatever you can get. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t understand people justâ€¦ What are you waiting for? People that shit on the holidays, why, what? The cookies, the music, the smiles? Whatâ€™s the problem? What, what do you think is going to happen? You think fireworks are gonna shoot out of our ass eventually? No, itâ€™s not gonna happen.
So whatever you gotta do to make yourself happy, do it, do it. Some people like to drink. Good for you, good for you. Iâ€™m one of you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Iâ€™m a grown-up who drinks. Yeah, I have a liquor cabinet now. A liquor cabinet, yeah. I didnâ€™t build it. I just had a cabinet filled with other stuff, and I slowly moved it out and replaced it with booze. The liquor cabinet shows you how evil alcohol really is, doesnâ€™t it? Think about it. Itâ€™s just a hot box. No refrigeration, no ventilation. Just a hot square box. You take a thing of whiskey out, take a drink, put it back, come back five years later, itâ€™s fine. Thatâ€™s evil stuff. Put a ham sandwich in the liquor cabinet. You come back five years later, thereâ€™s gonna be a baby pig man living in there. Grown out of pork and mold. â€œHey, hey!â€ But heâ€™s in a liquor cabinet, so heâ€™s classy. Probably a suit and fancy shoes. Baby pig man, another advantage of drinking.
Yeah, some people drink, some people tickle strangers. I like putting my balls on a marble countertop. I canâ€™t even say it without smiling. Thereâ€™s something so refreshing. Itâ€™s not even that theyâ€™re that heavy, but something about standing and not having to carry them for a brief momentâ€¦ Itâ€™s soâ€¦ And that cold dark marble. You could do it too, ladies. Let the girls out. Put the hot under part on cold marble island. Anyone comes in, just tell â€™em your back hurts. â€œIâ€™ll be right with you.â€ Whatever you gotta do.
Some people like to smoke pot. Some people enjoy that. There they are. I always love that clap. Itâ€™s always very proud, and then they realize itâ€™s only, like, five people. â€œNow Iâ€™m really freaking out.â€ I have a reminder on my body from those years when I used to get high, and itâ€™s just a reminder of how stupid I was at the time.
I donâ€™t wear shorts anymore because of it. Itâ€™s a bad tattoo, and I just picked it off a wall in New Jersey. I wouldnâ€™t pick a t-shirt off a wall in New Jersey. Iâ€™m like, â€œI want that on my body.â€ Like a moron. Itâ€™s a gnome. Itâ€™s a gnome! I wish I was kidding. I am not. Heâ€™s got a hat, a red hat, and sparkles around it, and a big lame beard. And on the wall he was watering a pot plant, and even high I was like, â€œno, thatâ€™s going too far. â€œI see him as a magical creature. â€œHe should have a walking stick â€œfor when he goes through the forest and talks to the other gnomes, I guess.â€ And this tattoo guy was likeâ€¦ â€œLike that?â€ â€œNo, but yeah now.â€ Forever and ever. I need some big tube socks now. Donâ€™t do drugs, kids.
I also got kids around too. Thatâ€™s another thing. You donâ€™t wanna be high when you got kids around the house. They always know. They always know. I made that mistake once. My friend was getting high watching football. â€œYou want some?â€ â€œYeah, okay.â€ I was flying, I hadnâ€™t done it in so long. The whole time walking home Iâ€™m like, â€œI hope they donâ€™t notice. I hope they donâ€™t notice.â€ My little one came right up to me, â€œyou look different.â€ â€œI am different. Iâ€™m a loser. You look different too. Youâ€™re so little. Whatâ€™s it like to be so little? Look at your hands. Theyâ€™re like paws. No wonder you always drop stuff. You have paws. Why do you have pockets in your little pants? Seriously? Where are you going? You donâ€™t have money or keys. Why pockets?â€
I love kids. I like kids a lot. Iâ€™m in a good spot with mine. Iâ€™m finally done raising them, which is awesome. Yeah, theyâ€™re nine and six. I made it. It took a long time, a lot of ups and downs, but I am done. Iâ€™m not even kidding, Iâ€¦ Really. They donâ€™t even need me anymore. You should see their Christmas list. Itâ€™s not even toys. Itâ€™s, like, appliances and furniture. I think they have an apartment in Detroit Iâ€™m not aware of.
You know what it really is? I just canâ€™t discipline them anymore. I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t fight with little people and their little problems, I canâ€™t. I got big stuff I gotta deal with every day. I canâ€™t fight with you and your socks and not wanting to pick them up, I canâ€™t. This is my parenting technique now. I go, â€œyou brush your teeth.â€ They go, â€œI donâ€™t want to brush my teeth.â€ And I say, â€œfine,â€ and I walk out of the room. â€œI tried to help. You donâ€™t want my help. Iâ€™ll let life take care of you.â€
Thatâ€™s what life does, it disciplines you. It corrects you when youâ€™re wrong. Walk down the street with no pants on. Lifeâ€™s gonna let you know itâ€™s not a cool thing to do. Look, whoâ€™s gonna make her brush her teeth more, me saying it over and over or a bunch of eight-year-old girls cornering her in the locker room and calling her â€œshit mouthâ€? That happens once, sheâ€™s gonna brush her ass off for the rest of her life. Sheâ€™ll be 50 going, â€œdonâ€™t call me shit mouth.â€
Canâ€™t do it. And, look, how long are we gonna live with each other? What, another eight, nine years tops? Why all the tension? Letâ€™s enjoy ourselves, you know? Letâ€™s have a good time and go our separate ways as friends. I want them to look back and be like, â€œyou know what? That guy was fun. I like him. He was a little weird, but he was kinda funny. I like that guy.â€
Theyâ€™re not gonna say it about their mother, so they might as well say it about me. Well, look, thereâ€™s a good cop and a bad cop, right? And sheâ€™s the bad cop. My wifeâ€™s amazing. She does everything. But sheâ€™s not very popular in the house. Well, sheâ€™s fried. She just wakes up pissed off. She doesnâ€™t even have a fuse. Soon as she opens her eyes, â€œdid everybody do what theyâ€™re supposed to do?â€ â€œWhat was I supposed to do? I was asleep. Was I supposed to get something from sleepy town orâ€¦ Iâ€™ll go back. You want me to go back?â€
And I know weâ€™re supposed to show a united front. You know, right or wrong, as parents, you back each other up against these little people who are trying to kill you. But sheâ€™s so off the charts, I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ll lose all my credibility. The kids and I just roll our eyes all day long. Sheâ€™ll be like, â€œeverybody get to bed!â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œdad?â€ â€œI know. Itâ€™s not like it gets better when you go to sleep. Trust me. Iâ€™ve got four more hours of this. Sheâ€™s making you go to sleep. Sheâ€™s making me stay up.â€
And, look, I like the whole thing. I love the chaotic mess that it all is, I do. I fought it for years, I tried to keep it clean. Thatâ€™s not fun. Life is about a mess. Make your life a chaotic mess. Yeah. Iâ€™m not saying you need kids. You donâ€™t need kids, but get something. Get some hermit crabs, getâ€¦ Get a three-legged dog. Thatâ€™ll be good stories. Youâ€™ll have a lot of laughs with that. Get something. Make it a big chaotic mess. Do it, really. Just make it a big thing. I do it all. I do it all.
I go to dance recitals now. If that doesnâ€™t show I love you, then nothing will. I go to dance recitals. Always on a Sunday, when I have a much better offer, and I have to say no and carry hair products and tutus through the city and go to dance recitals. And, look, I donâ€™t want to sound like an idiot. When your kid goes up there, itâ€™s amazing, itâ€™s amazing. You know, I didnâ€™t even know they were learning something all year. No idea. I just dropped them off. â€œSomeone else is watching them for an hour. Letâ€™s get a drink. You want a drink? Yeah, letâ€™s go. We got time.â€
And then they waddle out there on the stage, and they do a little funny dance, and they kinda stumble, and itâ€™s heartwarming, and you get choked up and misty-eyed, that lasts for, like, 30 seconds. And then you have to sit through 4 1/2 hours of other peopleâ€™s useless bags of garbage. And the only people who are honest in the entire auditorium are the little boys that got dragged there against their will.
There was thisâ€¦ At this last recital, there was this chunky monkey in a leotard stomping her way through a solo. I donâ€™t know how much money her father gave to this school. She shouldnâ€™t have been outside in the daylight, let alone on stage in a spotlight. And out of the darkness you just heard this little boy yell, â€œmake it stop!â€ â€œSomebody stop it!â€ I wish I had the balls to be so honest that grown men have to carry me out of the auditorium into the lobby, â€™cause you know that was the kidâ€™s plan. As soon as he gets out there, â€œanyone get a light? Thatâ€™s a horrible show. Am I wrong? Thatâ€™s terrible entertainment.â€
My new thing now is I skate. Iâ€™m skating. I skate, ice skate. Put on clothes in the winter and go on ice. Because people wake me up at 6:00 in the morning saying theyâ€™re bored. Can you imagine? The sunâ€™s not even up, and thereâ€™s a little face saying, â€œIâ€™m bored.â€ If a roommate did that, youâ€™d punch him right in the face. â€œWell, now you got something to do. Go ice that down.â€ But society doesnâ€™t let you punch little girls in the face. So I get up. And we make unicorns with glue sticks and glitter and stuff, and we run out of activities by 7:00. So now we skate. And I know what youâ€™re thinking. â€œTom, do you even belong on skates? Do you know how to skate?â€ No, not at all. Thatâ€™s not the point. Does a bear belong in the circus on a unicycle going around in circles in a party hat? No, but he does what heâ€™s told, and they feed him when heâ€™s done.
And Iâ€™m the best skater in the family. Thatâ€™s how moronic this activity is. I canâ€™t do it at all, and I am the leader. So I go out and people attach themselves to me, and I just try and keep them up. And they fall off one by one like discarded Christmas trees. And eventually we all crawl to the edge for safety. And we get up, and weâ€™re hungry, and weâ€™re wet, and then we move as a pack into the city and look for food. And we sit in a diner, and we buy pasta for, like, 50 bucks, and get ripped off and spill stuff on each other and make a scene, and eventually we warm up and forget how miserable we were and plan our next skate. And this is my life now. I do weird stuff with people I make. I used to do weird stuff with people I met in bars. Now I make people, and I do weird stuff with them.
Now weâ€™re living their lives for them. Weâ€™re on top of them. Weâ€™re taking their tests for them. Weâ€™re planning their playdates. Weâ€™re in their life all the time, and itâ€™s failing them, itâ€™s failing them. Kids are showing up at collegeâ€¦ Thereâ€™s reports of kids showing up depressed â€™cause they donâ€™t know how to do anything, anything. Theyâ€™re just like, â€œmy bed isnâ€™t made again today! Why is this happening? I used to wake up, my bed would be made, and thereâ€™d be Mickey mouse pancakes. Now nothing.â€
Weâ€™re failing them. All their test scores globally are in the toilet, in the toilet. We kicked ass when we were little. You know why? Our parents didnâ€™t care. Iâ€™m going to school, you go to work. Weâ€™ll meet here at dinner. Donâ€™t screw up. And we got our little book bags, and weâ€™d head out of the house like little businesspeople, and we got stuff done. You had meetings at your lockers. You bought Cliff Notes off the black market. You forged signatures if you had to. And we were number one in the world. Number one.
Itâ€™s arrogance. Itâ€™s arrogance of the parents that think youâ€™re so important. Youâ€™re not that important. Itâ€™s easy to make a kid. Itâ€™s really easy. And then your job really is when theyâ€™re little stop them from waddling into traffic, electricity, or a weird uncle. Thatâ€™s it. That is it. Other than that, get out of their way. All the best people on the planet didnâ€™t even have their parents around. Steve Jobs was an orphan. Albert Einstein left home when he was 15. Abraham Lincoln, when he was six years old, cooked and ate both his parents. Yeah, little-known fact, but itâ€™s true. Wasnâ€™t in the movie, but it happened. Thatâ€™s why he was 60 feet tall. Human bone marrow.
We all show up on this planet with our personalities already intact. As soon as youâ€™re here, youâ€™re made, youâ€™re made. And youâ€™re either allowed to flower, or youâ€™re stomped out by the grown-ups in your life. My kids are exactly the same as when they got here, exactly, and I had nothing to do with it. Nothing. My little one is tough as nails. She has a back like Michael Phelps. She eats rocks. Sheâ€™s a killer. Weâ€™re all scared of her, all the family. Weâ€™re at the airport, I was like, â€œwhereâ€™s the luggage?â€ She has it already. â€œLetâ€™s go.â€ â€œHurry up, sheâ€™s getting in the cab.â€ â€œWhereâ€™d she get money?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know.â€
And she was that way immediately. She came out of my wife. They put her on that little baby bread warmer shelf. She immediately started getting up like she had somewhere to go. â€œArgh!â€ Nurses were passing out. They never saw a baby do a push-up their first five seconds on the planet. â€œAgh, letâ€™s get out of here.â€ I canâ€™t control that. I just have to watch her and hope she doesnâ€™t turn evil. Thatâ€™s all I can do.
And the other one is smart. Sheâ€™s always been that way. She wants help with her homework now, I canâ€™t do it, canâ€™t do it. Fourth grade math, Iâ€™m out, Iâ€™m out. Itâ€™s fraction time. Good night, Iâ€™m out. I get nervous when the pizza guy comes I have to do the change and the tip in the moment. I just hold up balled-up money like Iâ€™m from a small town in Belgium. You need more of this? You want more?
We infantilize these kids. No one talks to their kids the way we do. You gonna put on your jammy-wammies? You gonna get all cuddly-wuddly on the couchie-poo? You have a big day tomorrow. You have your S.A.T.S. Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
Other cultures, the kids go to school and work immediately. These little Chinese kids putting together our iPhones, kicking ass over there. Seriously, they go to school for, like, 50 hours. They bicycle home 500 miles. They give their ancient grandparents a sponge bath, one piece of seaweed, off to the apple factory for the night shift. And theyâ€™re happy for the benefits.
Our kids go to school for, like, three hours, then waddle around all night looking for candy. â€œMahh! Thereâ€™s gotta be some Skittles somewhere.â€
Every generation is smarter than the one that came before it, right? You were smarter than your parents. So these kids, with technology, it happens so much faster, so much faster. Just think about their phones. Think about the amount of pornography they have in their pockets 24 hours a day. You know what I had to do when I was eight years old to see a picture of a naked lady in a magazine? I had to run an underground railroad for porn. A series of meeting points and backpack drop-offs and swapping out bicycles in abandoned garages. Get it through the woods, into the house, into the basement, into the crawl space. Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Weâ€™d crawl back through the dirt with a book of matches.
Could you imagine showing a Playboy to an eight-year-old now? Theyâ€™d be like, â€œno, I was into that in preschool. More into feet now.â€
Iâ€™m raising girls. Itâ€™s all girls in my house, all girls. Whenever I say Iâ€™m raising girls, women always go, â€œitâ€™s gonna suck. â€œWait till they go through puberty. Your life is over.â€ Really? You want a boy going through puberty with what they do around the house? â€œWhere are all our tissues? â€œWhy are we going through so many tissues? â€œWhy do I only have one sock? Where are my socks?â€ Some hairy Gollum crawling down the hallway, taking a shower for an hour and a half, coming out all sweaty, â€œaghh.â€
You can have it. Iâ€™ll take a girl anytime. Love girls. But I know thereâ€™s a limit, thereâ€™s a limit to how much I can teach them. At a certain point, I gotta just back off â€™cause I donâ€™t know it, and my wife takes over. â€˜Cause thereâ€™s certain things that women know that you only know from other women. You only share it with other women. We donâ€™t really know it. Itâ€™s like this weird martial art. It makes you so strong and cunning. Itâ€™s like this lady karate. Very devious. One of your master strokes is making us think that weâ€™re the powerful ones. I really thought it for years. Well, the whole game is set up that way, isnâ€™t it? â€œIâ€™ll ask her on a date. Iâ€™ll ask her to marry me. Iâ€™ll give her my name. Agh!â€ And women are very smart, they go along with it. â€œOkay, maybe Iâ€™ll hyphenate it, but all right.â€
And then she does something one Sunday afternoon. You realize, my god, she could kill me in a second. So much more cunning. Women will get rid of a lifelong friend just from an eye roll at dinner. â€œDid you see how that bitch looked at me?â€ And sheâ€™s gone. Youâ€™ll never see her again. Gone, like old time Russia. Out of the contacts. Out of the picture frames. Disappears. You know how scary that is to a man, to know that everyone in your life is on a giant roulette wheel of death? And that weâ€™re on there too at double zero just going around? Itâ€™s not gonna land on me, right? What are the odds?
Itâ€™s a terrifying concept to a man, â€™cause we never get rid of our friends ever, ever. Right? You meet a guy in kindergarten. If heâ€™s your friend, heâ€™s your friend for life. He could be the biggest jackass on the planet too. He could become an alcoholic drug addict, Rob a liquor store, go to jail, come out ten years later, come to your house, pee in your pool, hit on your wife, youâ€™re like, â€œthatâ€™s Don. Heâ€™s crazy, right? But you gotta love him, you gotta. Look what heâ€™s doing to the mailbox. Hilarious, dude!â€
And you think the closer you get to a woman, the safer youâ€™ll be, and youâ€™re wrong. Youâ€™re in more danger. â€˜Cause youâ€™re being manipulated in ways you donâ€™t even know. Think about it, every guy whoâ€™s married is fatter than when he started, every one. You think thatâ€™s a coincidence? You think men are just so overjoyed with matrimony that theyâ€™re just walking around with chocolate Sundaes. â€œWow, my life turned out so much better than I thought it would.â€
No. The common denominator is that youâ€™re married to a woman. And when you marry a woman, you think sheâ€™s gonna love you and care for you and Cherish you, and youâ€™re wrong. Her first instinct is to keep you. Sheâ€™s a nester. The woman is a nester. She makes the nest, builds the nest, wants everyone in that nest all the time. And guys are always trying to leave the nest, always, just to look for worms or do loopty loops. Sometimes check out another nest. â€œWhoâ€™s in that nest? Iâ€™m just looking.â€
And women are aware of this, and they want to prevent it from happening by feeding you all the time, essentially making you too fat to fly. So if you ever try and leave, you land on the ground and waddle in circles like a fat duck. And then all the pretty birds look down, â€œheâ€™s funny. Iâ€™d never have sex with him, but heâ€™s hilarious.â€
But you should be more powerful. It makes perfect sense that women are strong, â€™cause your lives are so much more difficult. You have so much more to deal with. Itâ€™s amazing. You have a lot more to deal with. Just the makeup alone. Just this never-ending art project youâ€™re involved in. Carrying luggage around your entire lives, filled with art supplies. Brushes and pencils and paints. Just painting the same face over and over and over. Youâ€™re like a crazy Van Gogh with an etch a sketch.
I donâ€™t even know why you do it. Who are you doing it for? Itâ€™s not for us. We donâ€™t care. All we care is that youâ€™re not a dude. Thatâ€™s all we care. Itâ€™s for other women. Itâ€™s that woman-on-woman hateful competition. Itâ€™s nasty. You ever see women say hello to each other? Nasty business, right? Itâ€™s all smiles up here. â€œHi.â€ â€œhi.â€ Then they give each other that slow look of death up and down. Find a weakness, hang on it until she knows that you notice. â€œSorry about that. You can get that taken care of.â€
Brutal. You should see the moms at my kidsâ€™ school trying to out-hot the other moms hilarious. 7:00 in the morning. They show up dressed to kill to out-hot the other moms. Are you high? No kid wants their mom to be hot. You just want a mom. You donâ€™t want a hot mom. You just want a flowered house dress and wobbly bingo arms. Right? Big, sloppy mom boobs. You curl up in her like a cinnamon-scented beanbag chair. Thatâ€™s a mom.
And I got news for you, if you are the hot mom, the other moms arenâ€™t calling you hot. Theyâ€™re calling you a whore.
The products that women get tricked into buying. They told women it might help their ass if they buy these Skechers shape-ups. Have you seen these orthopedic moon boots? Theyâ€™re like sneakers attached to Frankenstein feet. Theyâ€™re walking through the mall like Cirque du Soleil on stilts. â€œHowâ€™s my ass?â€ No oneâ€™s looking at your ass. Weâ€™re looking at your feet, afraid you have scoliosis.
The whole idea of what it is to be a woman in this culture is demented. Itâ€™s demented. All right, every image of a woman, itâ€™s something you canâ€™t be and itâ€™s something weâ€™re not interested in. Right, every ad with a woman, sheâ€™s 6â€™8â€³, emaciated, little boy boobs, and bubble lips. Just scowling at us through black mascara. Thatâ€™s not a woman. Thatâ€™s nice on a billboard. What would you do with that if you got it into your house? Thatâ€™d be like having a live giraffe in the living room. Knocking over lamps, hiding behind the piano. â€œWhat do we do with it?â€ â€œI donâ€™t know, give it more cocaine. It seems to like it.â€
Thatâ€™s not a woman. You want a woman, a partner for the rest of your life? Get a strong woman. Get one with a big back, help you mow the lawn once in a while. You donâ€™t want a cool, skinny chick. They get sick easy. Get a strong chick. Stands at the stove and stirs for hours. â€œWelcome home! Children play in playground. We not have playground. I build it. They play now.â€
Thatâ€™s a woman, especially in a family. Right, thatâ€™s another burden of the woman. The whole thing falls on you, the whole thing. You know, we thought it was gonna be different. We were gonna be the first generation of guys who were gonna pitch in, 50/50. Anything you do, weâ€™re gonna do too. 50/50. Our dads didnâ€™t do it, but weâ€™re gonna do it. 50/50. Didnâ€™t work out. It canâ€™t be 50/50, â€™cause we donâ€™t like these kids half as much as you do.
Itâ€™s a lot of work. The whole thingâ€™s a lot of work. A lot of work. I havenâ€™t slept in nine years. Nine years, no sleep. No sleep in nine years. I knew the baby part, I knew that. I didnâ€™t know you donâ€™t sleep for the rest of your life. Did not know that. You lay down like youâ€™re sleeping. You close your eyes like youâ€™re sleeping. But youâ€™re listening for trouble 24 hours a day. My little one threw up off the top bunk bed. All I had to hear in my sleep was, â€œâ€ she doesnâ€™t even know whatâ€™s happening yet. And Iâ€™m running like a marine in his underwear, grabbing anything that looks like a bucket. A cat, the pillow. You donâ€™t find anything, just go with your hand, just do it, just do it. Iâ€™ll catch it, Iâ€™ll deal with it. Just do it in my hand.
But thatâ€™s the whole deal right there, right? Your kid gets sick in the middle of the night. You do more chores in ten minutes than you did in four years of college. Bagging stuff up, carrying bodies, doing laundry. Itâ€™s like youâ€™re working for FEMA in the middle of the night. They come down the hall naked, stuff in their hair, â€œam I okay?â€ â€œGo stand in the tub. Stand in theâ€¦ Get her out of here. She smells.â€
And the only thing we have to clean in my house is all-natural cleaners. My wife wants to save the planet with orange peel mist. Sheâ€™s like, â€œit really works.â€ No, it doesnâ€™t. They wouldnâ€™t have invented all these other products if orange juice did the trick. Your kid throws up, you donâ€™t care about the planet. You wanna see Mr. Clean. You want that bald bastard just smiling at you. His tight shirt and an earring. You donâ€™t know if heâ€™s gay or straight or a pirate. Just looking at you like, â€œyeah, I might kill your cat, but Iâ€™ll leave this place smelling like lemons.â€
Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re supposed to do. I guess thatâ€™s what life is. Just get it and go and go. I donâ€™t want to get old though. Looks creepy. Doesnâ€™t it look like it hurts? Seriously? You ever look at an old person on the street looking at a curb they have to go up? Theyâ€™ll do, like, five dry runs before they go for it. Grabbing onto strangers. â€œHey.â€
Thatâ€™s another amazing thing about the time we live in. Science is moving at such a rate, weâ€™re gonna be able to stop the effects of aging. How amazing is that? Thereâ€™s gonna be no aging at a certain point. But the real bummer, weâ€™re gonna just miss it. Weâ€™re gonna be the last generation of old people. How awful is that? Theyâ€™re gonna look at us on the sidewalk like, â€œeww. â€œRemember when that used to happen? Look at their necks. Theyâ€™re like testicles.â€
Now weâ€™re at the weird stage where people are just hanging on. The doctors are just kinda working out the kinks. Theyâ€™re just kinda make us last longer. Like, â€œget a load of this guy. â€œHe shoulda been dead years ago. I filled him with batteries and Jujubes.â€
I donâ€™t wanna just last. Do you wanna just last? People always take pride in that. Justâ€¦ people in their family just keep going, especially if theyâ€™re a degenerate. Then you hear that story. They love telling that story. â€œYou know, my grandfather ate bacon every morning, smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, drank whiskey every night. Lived to 98 years old.â€ Yeah, and Iâ€™m sure he was a real treat to hang out with. Big bacon bag of bones with a racist ashtray for a mouth. Permanently attached to a vinyl recliner, sucking on an oxygen tank like heâ€™s scuba diving in the living room. Can we agree on that? If you need an oxygen tank, maybe itâ€™s time to wrap things up. Seriously, if the planet doesnâ€™t have air for you anymore and your best friend is a nickel slot machine, one more lap and hit the showers.
And, look, we canâ€™t just keep living on. We canâ€™t, we really canâ€™t. Itâ€™s getting too expensive. Social security, Medicare. We donâ€™t have the money. We canâ€™t afford it. We canâ€™t afford to keep the old people. We need a plan. A secret plan. Donâ€™t tell the old people about it. Weâ€™ll communicate through computers and whispers. Weâ€™ll just agree not to kill them, exactly, but not to work so hard in saving every one of them. We gotta treat it like a trip to the vet. We know you love muffins, but itâ€™s gonna be really expensive. Thereâ€™s a lot of other muffins out there.
And, look, I wouldnâ€™t be so scared if I knew what happened after. Is this it? We just die and thatâ€™s it? Nothing more? Nothing more? Or do we get to go to some place even greater. This is a great party. You wanna keep the party going. Ooh, itâ€™sâ€¦ yeah! But if there is some place magical and better than this, how â€™bout a text? How â€™bout an email? Nothing. Nobodyâ€™s saidâ€¦ We search all the time, and nothing.
My little girl wanted to go to church for the first time, and we donâ€™t go to church. I believe, but I donâ€™t believe enough to ruin my Sundays. I canâ€™t totally not believe, â€™cause I was raised catholic, and Iâ€™m terrified all the time. If you were raised catholic, you knowâ€¦ you canâ€™t shake it. Youâ€™re justâ€¦ no. My wife was raised catholic. She has the balls to completely not believe. Sheâ€™s like, â€œthe church is a patriarchal system to keep women downâ€¦ Itâ€™s bullshit.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œyeah, Iâ€™m with you.â€ But then on the side Iâ€™m like, â€œdear God, Iâ€™m sorry I live with this devil. â€œI donâ€™t know how this heathen got in my bed. â€œIf we die at the same time, â€œIâ€™m totally cool with splitting up. â€œSend her where you gotta send her, big guy. Iâ€™m coming with you.â€
But my little girl wanted to go, and it makes sense, â€™cause the church is the coolest building in the neighborhood, isnâ€™t it? Itâ€™s got spires and rainbow windows and bells ringing. Sheâ€™s like, â€œI want to see the show that goes on in there.â€ I was like, â€œall right, letâ€™s go. â€œLetâ€™s get dressed up and go to church. Iâ€™ll take you.â€
It felt right. Like when I was a kid. So I put on the suit and tie. She dressed up like a little girlâ€™s version of a woman, which is hilariousâ€¦ Little lipstick, you know? Everythingâ€™s poofy. Poofy dress, poofy socks. Little heels this big. She canâ€™t even walk. Sheâ€™s like a Billy Goat on ice, justâ€¦ But she thinks sheâ€™s hot â€™cause sheâ€™s carrying a purse filled with chapstick and pennies, you know. And I feel great too, â€™cause Iâ€™m walking with the cutest puppy on earth. Everybody that comes by, â€œsheâ€™s so cute.â€ And I milk it, Iâ€™m like, â€œI know. â€œWe donâ€™t have time for this. Weâ€™re on our way to church. Weâ€™re filled with goodness.â€ Every Sunday.
And we were having a great time. We were having a little date. Sheâ€™s yapping. Weâ€™re holding hands. Itâ€™s a great time. And she gets up the church steps. The doors open. She freezes. Starts digging into my hand. Sheâ€™s shaking like a leaf. Sheâ€™s looking up at the giant, bloody catholic Jesus hanging from the ceiling. And I realize we never told her the stories. Sheâ€™s looking at me like, â€œthis is a haunted house.â€ And we sit in the pew, itâ€™s all creaky and old, and old people are petting her. â€œHello, little girl.â€ Sheâ€™s holding her purse like a roller coaster rail. Just two eyes. Terrified. And it is a haunted house. You look through her eyes, and the rainbow windows from the outside tell the story of how he died, so itâ€™s someone being stepped on and stabbed. And big thing where they christen the babies. â€œDaddy, whatâ€™s that?â€ â€œThatâ€™s where we dunk babies underwater their first time here.â€
Then this old lady gets up and starts crossing the altar on the way to the organ. I was like, â€œno, not the organ. This is not gonna go well.â€ And to say sheâ€™s old is a compliment. Shoulda been dead for years. It was like a wicked witch made out of beef jerky. She gets up to that organ. She reaches out her old lady talons. The veins are coming off like sheâ€™s been attacked with silly string. She hits that organ. Bom bom! All I hear next to me is, â€œI wanna go now. I donâ€™t like it here.â€ Minnie Mouse is losing her marbles. Bom! I start laughing, I start that uncontrollable, youâ€™re not allowed to laugh but youâ€™re laughing, so now youâ€™re snorting. â€œLetâ€™s get out of here.â€â€â€ Bom bom!
Then the headliner comes out. The priest comes down the aisle. I swear to you, he looked like Dracula. Long head, the hair all greased back, and heâ€™s in his robe, so it doesnâ€™t even look like heâ€™s walking. Heâ€™s floating down the aisle. Theyâ€™re doing the whole smoke show in front of him, heâ€™sâ€¦ He gets to the microphone. â€œVelcome, everybody. Velcome.â€ I fall out. I am laughing out loud. Iâ€™m laughing. Sheâ€™s crying. People are turning and shaking their heads. We gotta go. We gotta go now, before this gets any scarier. Before he starts talking about drinking the blood of Christ, letâ€™s beat it.
So we go running out the aisle. We get outside. Outside, birds are chirping, sunâ€™s shining. We sit on the steps, look at each other, just start laughing like, â€œwhat the hell was that?â€ And, look, I donâ€™t know what god is or that spirit thing that weâ€™re always chasing, but whatever it is we were so much closer to it on the sidewalk together than whatever was going on inside that haunted house.
But weâ€™re not giving up. Weâ€™re going to a black church next time. â€˜Cause thatâ€™s where God really lives.
Thank you guys so much.
You guys were a wonderful crowd.
Thank you.

â€œBo Burnham: Insideâ€ is a comedy special written, directed, and performed by American comedian and musician Bo Burnham. It was released in 2021 and gained significant attention for its unique format and the way it was created during the COVID-19 pandemic.
â€œBo Burnham: Insideâ€ explores the experience of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bo Burnham wrote, directed, and performed the special entirely on his own, from a single room in his home. The special is an intimate and often introspective journey through a year of isolation, social distancing, and the emotional ups and downs that many people experienced during the pandemic.
The special includes several original songs, some of which became internet sensations in their own right. â€œAll Eyes on Me,â€ â€œWelcome to the Internet,â€ and â€œWhite Womanâ€™s Instagramâ€ are just a few of the memorable tunes.

Anthony Jeselnik: Fire in the Maternity Ward (2019) â€“ Transcript

Hi. Welcome to, uh, whatever this is. Um, Iâ€™ve been working for the last couple months, um, testing this camera, and testing lights, and writing, and Iâ€™ve decided to, uh, try to make a new special. For real. Um, itâ€™s not gonna be a normal special because thereâ€™s no audience, and thereâ€™s no crew. Itâ€™s just me and my camera, and you and your screen. Uh, the way thatâ€¦ that our Lord intended. Umâ€¦ And the whole special will beâ€¦ will be filmed in this, uh, room. And instead of being filmed in a single night, it will be filmed in uh, however long it takes to finish. I hope you, uh, enjoy it. Iâ€¦ I hope this special can maybe do for you what itâ€™s done for me these last couple months, which is, uh, to distract me from wanting to put a bullet into my head with a gun. Soâ€¦ Yeah, thank you. And a warning. Um, I can already sort of tell that this special is going to be a little all over the place, so donâ€™t expect incredibly smooth transitiâ€“

Hey, kids. Today, weâ€™re gonna learn about the world.
â™ª The world thatâ€™s around usÂ â™ª
â™ª Is pretty amazingÂ â™ª
â™ª But how does it work?Â â™ª
â™ª It must be complicatedÂ â™ª
â™ª The secret is the world can only workÂ â™ª
â™ª When everything works togetherÂ â™ª
â™ª A bee drinks from a flowerÂ â™ª
â™ª And leaves with its pollenÂ â™ª
â™ª A squirrel in a tree Spreads the seeds that have fallenÂ â™ª
â™ª Everything worksÂ togetherÂ â™ª
â™ª The biggest elephant, the littlest flyÂ â™ª
â™ª The gophers underground The birds in the skyÂ â™ª
â™ª And every single cricket Every fish in the seaÂ â™ª
â™ª Gives what they can And gets what they needÂ â™ª
â™ª That is how the world worksÂ â™ª
â™ª That is how the world worksÂ â™ª
â™ª From A to Zebra To the worms in the dirt â™ª
â™ª Thatâ€™s howÂ â™ª
â™ª It works â™ª
Hey, everyone. Look who stopped by to say hello.
Itâ€™s Socko.
Hey!
Where you been, Socko?
Iâ€™ve been where I always am when youâ€™re not wearing me on your hand. In a frightening, liminal space between states of being. Not quite dead, not quite alive. Itâ€™s similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis.
Socko, we were just talking about the world and how it works.
Boy, that sounds complicated.
Do you have anything youâ€™d want to teach us about the world?
I wouldnâ€™t say anything that you probably havenâ€™t already said yourself.
I donâ€™t know about that, Socko. How about you give it a try?
All right.
â™ª The simple narrative taught In every history class â™ª
â™ª Is demonstrably false And pedagogically classist â™ª
â™ª Donâ€™t you know The world is built with bloodÂ â™ª
â™ª And genocide and exploitationÂ â™ª
â™ª The global network of capital Essentially functions â™ª
â™ª To separate the worker From the means of production â™ª
â™ª And the FBI killed Martin Luther KingÂ â™ª
â™ª Private propertyâ€™s inherently theftÂ â™ª
â™ª And neoliberal fascists Are destroying the leftÂ â™ª
â™ª And every politicianÂ â™ª
â™ª Every cop on the streetÂ â™ª
â™ª Protects the interests Of the pedophilic corporate eliteÂ â™ª
â™ª That is how the world worksâ€¦Â â™ª
Really?
â™ª That is how the world worksÂ â™ª
â™ª Genocide The Natives say you got to it firstÂ â™ª
â™ª Thatâ€™s howÂ â™ª
â™ª It works â™ª
Thatâ€™s pretty intense.
No shit.
What can I do to help?
Read a book or something. I donâ€™t know. Just donâ€™t burden me with the responsibility of educating you. Itâ€™s incredibly exhausting.
Iâ€™m sorry, Socko. I was just trying to become a better person.
Why do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict through the myopic lens of your own self-actualization? This isnâ€™t about you. So either get with it, or get out of the fucking way.
Watch your mouth, buddy. Remember whoâ€™s on whose hand here.
But thatâ€™s what Iâ€“ Have you not been fucking listening? We are entrenched inâ€“
All right.
Wait! No, please! I donâ€™t want to go back. I canâ€™t goâ€¦ I canâ€™t go back. Please. Please. Iâ€™m sorry.
Are you gonna behave yourself?
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, sir.
Look at me.
Yes, sir.
Thatâ€™s better.
â™ª That is how the world worksÂ â™ª
â™ª That is how the world worksÂ â™ª
â™ª I hope you learned your lessonÂ â™ª
â™ª I did and it hurt!Â â™ª
â™ª Thatâ€™s howÂ â™ª
â™ª It worksÂ â™ª
No!
Hello, my name is Bo Burnham. And I am a former comedian, turned social brand consultant. Itâ€™s a very exciting time to be a, uh, brand. Itâ€™s also a bit of a scary time because customers expect a lot more from their brands than they did in the past. During this incredibly necessary and overdue social reckoning that weâ€™re having in our culture, it is no longer acceptable for brands to stay out of the conversation. Consumers want to know, â€œAre you willing to use your brand awareness to effect positive social change?â€ Which will create more brand awareness. The question I ask the brands I work with is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, isâ€¦ â€œAre you gonna be on the right side of history?â€
The question isnâ€™t, â€œWhat are you selling?â€ Orâ€¦ or â€œWhat service are you providing?â€ The question is, â€œWhat do you stand for?â€ Who are you,Â Bagel Bites?
All these big companies, theyâ€™re so scared of all this social change, and I come in and I put their fears to rest. You know, I tell them, â€œJust be honest.Tell your customers thatâ€¦ that JPMorgan is against racism.â€ In theory.
The question is no longer, â€œDo you want to buy Wheat Thins?â€ For example. The question is now, â€œWill you support Wheat Thins in the fight against Lyme disease?â€
Thereâ€™s no sugarcoating it. The world isâ€¦ fucked up. And youâ€™ve got a choice as a brand. You canâ€¦ hide and bury your head in the sand and hope it fixes itself, or you can roll up your sleeves and get to work, and sell Butterfingers.

Hereâ€™s a question for you guys. Umâ€¦
Is itâ€¦ is it necessary?
Is it necessary that every single person on this planet um, expresses every single opinion that they have on every single thing that occurs all at the same time?
Is thatâ€¦ is that necessary?
Umâ€¦
Or to ask in a slightly different way, um, canâ€¦ can anyone shut the fuck up?
Canâ€¦ can anyone, anyâ€¦ anyâ€¦ any one, any single one, can any oneâ€¦ shut the fuck up about anythingâ€“
About anyâ€¦ any single thing?
Can any single person shut the fuck up about any single thing for an hour?
You know, is thatâ€¦ is that possible?
And I know youâ€™re thinking, â€œYouâ€™re not shutting the fuck up right now,â€ and thatâ€™s true, butâ€¦
â™ª Who needs a coffee â€˜Cause Iâ€™m doing a run â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m writing down the orders now For everyoneÂ â™ª
â™ª The coffee is free, just like meÂ â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m an unpaid internÂ â™ª
â™ª Sorting papers, running aroundÂ â™ª
â™ª Sitting in the meeting Iâ€™m not making a soundÂ â™ª
â™ª Barely people, somehow legalÂ â™ª
â™ª Unpaid internÂ â™ª
â™ª You work all day, go back to your dormÂ â™ª
â™ª And since you canâ€™t afford a mortgage You just torrent a pornÂ â™ª
â™ª â€˜Cause youâ€™re an internÂ â™ª
â™ª Unpaid â™ª
Hey, everybody.
Um, I thought Iâ€™d do a reaction video to the song that you just saw me perform.
Thought that might be fun.
Um, so I got my laptop all set up. So Iâ€™m ready to go, and letâ€™s go.
â™ª Who needs a coffee â€˜Cause Iâ€™m doing a runâ€¦ â™ª
I like this song.
Um, so the idea with this song was basically that thereâ€™s so many songs in the past aboutâ€¦ about working-class jobs, but not a lot about the labor exploitation of the modern world, so that was the idea here.
â™ª Barely people, somehow legalâ€¦ â™ª
My beard is a little shorter in this video â€™cause I filmed it a couple weeks ago.
â™ª Go back to your dormÂ â™ª
â™ª And since you canâ€™t afford a mortgage You justâ€¦Â â™ª
I think it holds up. The song, not the beard.
â™ª Unpaid â™ª
And then you cut. I think itâ€™s funny to cut right onâ€“
â€¦do a reaction video to the song that you just saw me perform.
Thought that might be fun.
Whatâ€¦
Um, so I got myâ€¦
Because this video played after that.
Right. So, and nowâ€¦ Right.
Okay, so Iâ€™ll just keep reacting.
So, this is me reacting to the song.
Umâ€¦
What Iâ€™m doing is Iâ€™m explaining what the song means.
Um, and what itâ€™s about. Iâ€™m being a little pretentious.
Itâ€™s, uhâ€¦ itâ€™s an instinct I have where I need everything that I write to have some deeper meaning or something.
But itâ€™s a stupid song, and, uh, it doesnâ€™t really mean anything, and, uh, itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s pretty unlikable that Iâ€¦ that I feel this need, this desperate need, to be seen as intelligent.
And the videoâ€™s ending here, as you can see, and look, Iâ€™m very confused. See, Iâ€™m very, very confused.
â€˜Cause Iâ€™m staring at myself, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking at, and Iâ€™m starting to catch up now, and realizing whatâ€™s going on.
And, uh, yeah, now Iâ€™m deciding to react to the reaction to the video.
So here, um, Iâ€™m reacting to my own reacting, and Iâ€™m criticizing my initial reaction forâ€¦ for being pretentious, which isâ€¦ which is honestly, itâ€™s aâ€¦ itâ€™s a defense mechanism.
Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m so worried that criticism will be levied against me that I levy it against myself before anyone else can.
And I think that, â€œOh, if Iâ€™m self-aware about being a douchebag, itâ€™ll somehow make me less of a douchebag.â€ But itâ€¦ but it doesnâ€™t.
Um, self-awareness does not absolve anybody of anything.
Am I balding? This is really, really disturbing.
I donâ€™t like looking at myself like this, and I wantâ€¦ I want this to stop.
Okay, I want this to stop. Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m stopping this.
So, yeah, that was, uh, my reaction to the song, and I hope you enjoyed it.

I donâ€™t know about you guys, but, um, you know, Iâ€™ve been thinking recently thatâ€¦ that you know, maybe, um, allowing giant digital media corporations to exploit the neurochemical drama of our children for profitâ€¦
You know, maybe that was, uhâ€¦ a bad call by us.
Maybeâ€¦ maybe theâ€¦ the flattening of the entire subjective human experience into aâ€¦ lifeless exchange of value that benefits nobody, except for, um, you know, a handful of bug-eyed salamanders in Silicon Valleyâ€¦
Maybe that as aâ€¦ as a way of life foreverâ€¦ maybe thatâ€™s, um, not good.
Iâ€™mâ€¦ horny.

â™ª Weâ€™ve got you surroundedÂ â™ª
One more.
â™ª I grew up as your usual suburbaniteÂ â™ª
â™ª A tiny town in Massachusetts Overwhelmingly whiteÂ â™ª
â™ª I went to church on Sundays In a suit and a tieÂ â™ª
â™ª Then spent my free time Watching Family Guy â™ª
â™ª I started doing comedy When I was just a sheltered kidÂ â™ª
â™ª I wrote offensive shit And I said itÂ â™ª
â™ª Father, please forgive me For I did not realize what I didÂ â™ª
â™ª Or that Iâ€™d live to regret itÂ â™ª
â™ª Times are changing And Iâ€™m getting old â™ª
â™ª Are you gonna hold me accountable?Â â™ª
â™ª My bed is empty, and Iâ€™m getting coldÂ â™ª
â™ª Isnâ€™t anybody gonna Hold me accountable? â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m problematicÂ â™ª
â™ª Heâ€™s a problemÂ â™ª
â™ª When I was 17, on HalloweenÂ â™ª
â™ª I dressed up as AladdinÂ â™ª
â™ª Heâ€™s a problemÂ â™ª
â™ª I did not darken my skinÂ â™ª
â™ª But still it feels weird in hindsightÂ â™ª
â™ª I want to show you How Iâ€™m growing as a person, but firstÂ â™ª
â™ª I feel I must address the lyrics From the previous verseÂ â™ª
â™ª I tried to hide behind my childhood And thatâ€™s not okayÂ â™ª
â™ª My actions are my own I wonâ€™t explain them awayÂ â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ve done a lot of self-reflecting Since I started singing this songÂ â™ª
â™ª I was totally wrong when I said itÂ â™ª
â™ª Father, please forgive me For I did not realize what I didÂ â™ª
â™ª Or that Iâ€™d live to regret itÂ â™ª
â™ª Times are changing And Iâ€™m getting old â™ª

â™ª Isnâ€™t anybody gonna Hold me accountable? â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m problematicÂ â™ª
â™ª Heâ€™s a problemÂ â™ª
â™ª I just remembered that Aladdin costumeâ€™s In my motherâ€™s atticÂ â™ª
â™ª Heâ€™s a problem â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m gonna go home and burn itâ€¦ â™ª
Or not burn it. Is burning it bad? What should I do with it?
â™ª And Iâ€™ve been totally awfulÂ â™ª
â™ª My closet is chock-full of stuff That is vaguely shittyÂ â™ª
â™ª All of it was perfectly lawfulÂ â™ª
â™ª Just not very thoughtful at all And just really shittyÂ â™ª
â™ª And Iâ€™ve been totally awfulÂ â™ª

â™ª First, I gotta fess upÂ â™ª
â™ª SorryÂ â™ª
â™ª SorryÂ â™ª
Shâ€“
So, umâ€¦
Iâ€™ve been working on this special now for six months.
Andâ€¦ the whole time Iâ€™ve had aâ€¦ a goal in mind, which is I wanted to finish this thing before I turned 30.
Um, because the idea ofâ€¦ of turning 30, while still in this fucking room, working on this thing alone, um, that just seemedâ€¦ I justâ€¦ I just wanted to avoid that.
Soâ€¦
And you might be thinking, â€œWell, thatâ€™s fine. You know, look at you.â€
â€œYou radiate such youth.â€
â€œYou must not be turning 30 for years.â€
And thatâ€™s very, uh, nice of you to say.
But the truth is um, I turn 30 in less than a minute.
So Iâ€™m just gonna sit here and enjoy uh, my twenties, and thenÂ get back to work.
Yay.
â™ª I used to run for milesÂ â™ª
â™ª I used to ride my bikeÂ â™ª
â™ª I used to wake up with a smileÂ â™ª
â™ª And goÂ to bed at night with a dreamÂ â™ª
Ah.
â™ª But now Iâ€™m turning 30Â â™ª
â™ª No!Â â™ª
â™ª I used to be the young oneÂ â™ª
â™ª Got used to meeting peopleÂ â™ª
â™ª Who were used to meeting someoneÂ â™ª
â™ª Who was born in 1990Â â™ª
â™ª No way!Â â™ª
Yeah, I was born in 1990.
â™ª Now Iâ€™m turning 30Â â™ª
Godâ€¦ God damn it.
â™ª Iâ€™m â™ª
â™ª Turning 30, turning 30 â™ª
â™ª Turning â™ª
â™ª Turning 30, turning 30 â™ª
â™ª Thirty â™ª
â™ª Turning 30, turning 30 â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m turning 30 â™ª
â™ª Turning 30, turning 30 â™ª
â™ª When he was 27Â â™ª
â™ª My granddad fought in VietnamÂ â™ª
â™ª When I was 27Â â™ª
â™ª I built a birdhouse with my momÂ â™ª
Oh fuck.
â™ª How am I 30?Â â™ª
â™ª I used to make fun of the boomersÂ â™ª
â™ª In retrospect, a bit too muchÂ â™ª
â™ª Now all these fucking zoomersÂ â™ª
â™ª Are telling me that Iâ€™m out of touch â™ª
Oh yeah? Well, your fucking phones are poisoning your minds. Okay?
So when you develop a dissociative mental disorder in your late twenties, donâ€™t come crawling back to me.
â™ª Iâ€™m â™ª
â™ª Turning 30, turning 30 â™ª
â™ª Turning â™ª
â™ª Turning 30, turning 30 â™ª
â™ª Thirty â™ª
â™ª Turning 30, turning 30 â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m turning 30 â™ª
â™ª Turning 30, turning 30 â™ª
â™ª And now my stupid friends Are having stupid childrenÂ â™ª
â™ª My stupid friends Are having stupid childrenÂ â™ª
â™ª My stupid friends Are having stupid childrenÂ â™ª
â™ª My stupid friends Are having stupid childrenÂ â™ª
â™ª And now my stupid friends Are having stupid childrenÂ â™ª
â™ª My stupid friends Are having stupid childrenÂ â™ª
â™ª My stupid friends Are having stupid childrenÂ â™ª
â™ª Stupid, fucking ugly, boring childrenÂ â™ª
â™ª Itâ€™s 2020, and Iâ€™m 30Â â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™ll do another tenÂ â™ª
â™ª 2030 Iâ€™ll be 40 and kill myself thenÂ â™ª
Okay.
Check that one.
Weâ€™ll do one more.
I just wanna say for the record, um, that I do not want to kill myself, okay?
I donâ€™t wanna kill myself, and Iâ€™m not going to kill myself.
Um, and if youâ€™re out there and youâ€™re struggling with suicidal thoughts and you want to kill yourself,
I just want to tell you donâ€™t.
Okay? Can you not, please?
Just donâ€™t. All right?
Fucking quit it with theâ€“
But really, donâ€™t kill yourself. You donâ€™t want to, becauseâ€¦
There are people that love youâ€¦
Thatâ€™s not true necessarily, but there could be people that love you in the future, and just donâ€™t.
Iâ€™ve had people close to me kill themselves, and Iâ€™ll be honest with you, didnâ€™t love it.
Didnâ€™t love that.
So just donâ€™t.
But if I could kill myself for a yearâ€¦
If I canâ€“ Iâ€™d do it today.
If I could kill myself today and be dead until like 18 months from now, um, I would do it, but alasâ€¦ when you kill yourself, youâ€™re dead forever, and we shouldnâ€™t be dead forever yet.
So letâ€™s not. Right?
Come on, guys.
â™ª How are you feeling?Â â™ª
â™ª Do you like the show?Â â™ª
â™ª Are you tired of it?Â â™ª
â™ª Never mind, I donâ€™t wanna knowÂ â™ª
â™ª Are you finding it boring?Â â™ª
â™ª Too fast, too slow?Â â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™m asking but donâ€™t answerÂ â™ª
â™ª â€˜Cause I donâ€™t wanna knowÂ â™ª
â™ª Do I have your attention?Â â™ª
â™ª Yes or no?Â â™ª
â™ª I bet Iâ€™d guess the answerÂ â™ª
â™ª But I donâ€™t wanna knowÂ â™ª
â™ª Am I on in the background?Â â™ª
â™ª Are you on your phone?Â â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™d ask you what youâ€™re watchingÂ â™ª
â™ª But I donâ€™t wanna knowÂ â™ª
â™ª Is there anyone out there?Â â™ª
â™ª Or am I all alone?Â â™ª
â™ª It wouldnâ€™t make a differenceÂ â™ª
â™ª Still I donâ€™t wanna knowÂ â™ª
â™ª I thought itâ€™d be over by nowÂ â™ª
â™ª But I got a while to goÂ â™ª
â™ª Iâ€™d give away the endingÂ â™ª
â™ª But you donâ€™t wanna knâ€“Â â™ª

This is the title, Inside.
Iâ€™ve got a lot of requests for this game in chat.
Itâ€™s some indie developer. Iâ€™m not really sure.
Iâ€™m going in totally cold on this.
Um, JB, thank you for the three months. My dude, much appreciated.
Umâ€¦ Okay.
That looks pretty good, graphics-wise. I mean, I know itâ€™s a cinematic, butâ€¦

So is this like an escape the room?
Orâ€¦
Okay.

So heâ€™sâ€¦ heâ€™s not happy about being in this room.
I like the music. The music is actually nice on this.
Controls are actually pretty smooth. So youâ€™re in this like 2D set up, right?
Like, I canâ€™t control the camera.
Umâ€¦
Iâ€™ll give itâ€“ I guess Iâ€™ll cry again.
Heâ€™sâ€“
So is the dude big, or is the room small?
Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m confused about.
Chatâ€™s saying, try the door. Yeah, well, okay.
I mean, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s gonna be that simple, but I will.
Yeah, there ya go.
Um, okay, Well, I think heâ€™ll probably cry again.
Itâ€™s tough, dude.
Itâ€™s tough. Heâ€™s been in here a while.
Um, see, I donâ€™t like that.
I donâ€™t know why they feel the need to give the hint so quick.
I just wish theyâ€™d let meâ€¦ let me explore a little bit.
Whaâ€¦ Iâ€™m holding the flashlight like aâ€¦ like a cop.
Why is he doing that?
Ah.
All right. Okay. Soâ€¦
All right.
Okay, he seems a little happier now. Thatâ€™s nice.
I donâ€™t know.

Okay, Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m supposed to be doâ€“
Oh! Nice.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, great. Umâ€¦
All right, Iâ€™m into this.
Yeah, itâ€™s giving me sort of like Death Stranding vibes, you know, â€™cause itâ€™s, like, itâ€™s fucking boring, but thatâ€™s, like, the point, I think.

â™ª A chat room or twoÂ â™ª
â™ª We set our sights and spent our nightsÂ â™ª
â™ª WaitingÂ â™ª
â™ª For youÂ â™ª
â™ª YouÂ â™ª

â™ª Mommy let you use her iPadÂ â™ª
â™ª You were barely twoÂ â™ª
â™ª And it did all the thingsÂ â™ª
â™ª We designed it to doÂ â™ª

Oh.
â™ª Look at youÂ â™ª
â™ª You, you â™ª
â™ª Unstoppable, watchableÂ â™ª

Iâ€™ve been freaking out for a long time, thinking Iâ€™m never gonna finish this specialÂ and be working on it forever.
And recently, Iâ€™ve been feeling like, â€œOh, man, maybe I am getting close to done with this.â€
â€œMaybe Iâ€™m gonna finish it after all.â€ And that has made me completely freak out because if I finish this special, that means that I have to, um, not work on it anymore.
And that means I have to just live my life, and so Iâ€™m not gonna do that, and Iâ€™m gonna not finish the special.
Iâ€™m gonna work on it forever, I think.
So, yeah, Iâ€™m gonna work on this forever, and Iâ€™m never gonna release it. Iâ€™m not talking to anybody now.
Iâ€™m just talking to myself.
So, yeah, who fucking cares?
Fuck you, and goodbye, and letâ€™s keep going.

Man, you guys are a great crowd.
Give it up for yourselves for coming out, by the way, tonight. Give it up.
Supporting live comedy in these weird times.
Um, itâ€™s crazy. Umâ€¦
These are some pretty crazy times, but itâ€™s nice during these crazy times that we can get together. We can laugh.
You know? Umâ€¦
Iâ€™ve learned something over this last year, which is pretty funny.
Um, Iâ€™ve learned that real-world human-to-human tactile contact will kill you, and that all human interaction, whether it be social, political, spiritual, sexual, or interpersonal should be contained in the much more safe, much more real interior digital space.
That the outside world, the non-digital world, is merely a theatrical space in which one stages and records content for the much more real, much more vital digital space.
One should only engage with the outside world as one engages with a coal mine.
Suit up, gather what is needed, and return to the surface.
Umâ€¦
And is it just me, or do pirates need to take a little bit better care of their fuckinâ€™ maps?
You know, when I find a pirateâ€™s map, itâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s always tea-stained, and the edges are burnt, and itâ€™s like if youâ€™re a pirate, all right, and youâ€™re gonna make this map and expect me to carry it around the globe as I search for your treasure, then laminate it.
I canâ€™t really, uh, play the guitar very well, um, or sing, soâ€¦
You know, apologies.
